TWENTY-FOUR-HOUR SECURITY VIDEO RECORDING

Nothing wrong with it, right?

4
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,127
What the hell?

5
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,546
-Are you drunk?
-Call the cops now!

6
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,762
I never could've imagined

7
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:24,055
that you'd be a mole.

8
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,766
Please don't do it.

9
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,686
Sung-geun, Yong-soo, Victor…

10
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,939
-All dead. Because of you.
-Please don't.

11
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,983
You're gonna tell me
who's behind all this?

12
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,610
Hurry up! Spit it out!

13
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,321
I’m sorry.

14
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:57,839
Freeze!

15
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,369
It's me. I'm folding.

16

FOUR YEARS LATER, SEOUL

18
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:17,043
<i>Well after midnight,</i>
<i>Chairman Lee of Sang-in Group</i>

19
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:20,505
is still being questioned for charges
of bribery and stock manipulation.

20
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,424
<i>According to the Prosecutor's Office,</i>

21
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:26,135
<i>if Chairman Lee continues</i>
<i>to deny the charges against him,</i>

22
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,430
<i>officials may be forced</i>
<i>to issue a warrant for his arrest.</i>

23
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,354
Are you tired?

24
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,523
Do you need a break maybe?

25
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:41,484
Just be honest with me for a minute.
Can you do that?

26
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,196
Why are you so obsessed with nailing me?

27
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,533
What? Nailing you?

28
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,536
If you committed a crime,
you should pay for it.

29
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,915
It seems like everyone else
is scared to even touch you,

30
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,167
but I'm definitely not.

31
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,170
So you just want to put me behind bars?

32
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:03,423
Yeah.

33
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,677
Do you have what it takes?

34
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,764
I'm gonna give it my best shot.

35
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,237
Close it.

36
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,158
We've got a problem here.

37
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,786
There's been a serious violation.

38
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:36,914
What violation?

39
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:42,336
Your investigators entered
their offices illegally.

40
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,547
I apologize.

41
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,967
It looks like
we walked right into their trap.

42
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,262
They haven't said anything
about it yet,

43
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:54,098
but as soon as we try to arrest him,
they'll use it against us.

44
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,768
No one in this room
is going to say a single word.

45
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:02,106
So whatever happens, keep your mouth shut.

46
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,611
Say it never happened.

47
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,322
You understand me? Huh?

48
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,660
I can't. I can't do that.

49
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,205
-Are you kidding me right now?
-Of course.

50
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,498
After all the work we did?

51
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,458
We committed a crime to catch a criminal!

52
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:26,172
Now we've sunk to their level.
Just actions preserve justice.

53
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,593
Get the camera! Camera!

54
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,138
Chairman Lee,
how do you feel right now?

55
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,098
We're over here!

56
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,642
Chairman Lee!

57
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,227
Chairman Lee, excuse me.

58
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:52,406
I gave you my card earlier,
but you threw it out in the restroom.

59
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,202
My apologies. I didn't think I'd need it.

60
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:57,954
Take it.

61
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,666
I promise you that
you'll be back here soon. I guarantee it.

You've got attitude.

65
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,593
Call me if you get fired.

66
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,512
I can help you find a job.

67
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,723
What is that?

68
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,684
Is that blood?

69
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:27,692
There.

70
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,278
Nice bow, son.

71
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,577
Chairman Lee,
what were you talking about?

72
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,995
Chairman Lee!

73
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,871
One last comment.

74
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,251
Wait, sir!

75
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,919
Thanks, please come again.

-A lemon soda?

78
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,260
Excuse me. Could you clean up our table?

79
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,095
Yes. I'll be right there!

80
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,513
Have you decided?

81
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,223

82
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,808

87
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:17,908

00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,428
Ma'am. This man is no ordinary prosecutor.

165
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:52,349
This is the guy
who took on Sang-in Group. He's a shark.

166
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,059
It was like David and Goliath.

167
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,605
Oh, wait a second.

168
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,982
And you even speak Chinese, right?

169
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,901
You said you trained in Beijing.

170
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:05,821
If I could get reinstated
to the position I had before,

171
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:07,615
then I'll go.

172
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,075
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

173
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,078
<i>we will soon be arriving</i>
<i>at Shenyang Taoxian International Airport.</i>

174
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,622
<i>The temperature in Shenyang…</i>

175
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,248
<i>Shenyang has long been</i>

176
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,752
<i>the center of East Asia's power struggle</i>
<i>over North Korea.</i>

177
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:22,796
<i>Intelligence agents</i>
<i>from neighboring countries</i>

178
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,050
are still waging a cold war
from within city limits.

179
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,217
Because of that,

180
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,596
intel related to activities
in Shenyang is highly classified.

181
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,056
And with…

182
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:36,268
black teams engaged
in a number of secret assignments,

183
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:41,565
it's become an unwritten rule
to overlook Shenyang in internal reviews.

184
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,443
So have any problems come up there?

185
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:49,156
We've just learned that the last few
months of reports from Shenyang

186
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,951
are completely fabricated.

187
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,663
We have no choice but to order a review.

188
00:15:55,746 --> 00:16:00,084
To find out what's behind the reports
and if there's any illegal activity.

189
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,922
<i>That's what we want you to find out</i>
<i>in Shenyang.</i>

190
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,425
I'm busy. I'm at the airport right now.

191
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,845
I'm not flying anywhere.

192
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,349
Oh, will you just stop it?

193
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,354

TECHMON INC
MANAGER HAN JI-HOON

195
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,734
Yeah. Who knows?

196
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,778
Some jerk is coming in from Seoul.

197
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:28,988
It's so annoying.

198
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,325
Oh. Oh, uh…

199
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,743
TECHMON INC
MANAGER HAN JI-HOON

200
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:39,289
I mean, listen, they reached out to us
literally this morning, you know.

201
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,709
And they didn't say anything
except that you were coming

202
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,086
We had no time to get ready.
We're blindsided.

203
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,548
Those guys in Seoul makes you wanna…

204
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:51,135
I mean, it's about time
they got a taste of the real world.

205
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,222
All right.

206
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,766
Not what you expected?

207
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,395
This place isn't the typical Chinese city
that most people think of

208
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,230
like Beijing or Shanghai.

209
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,065
It’s a city of heavy industry

210
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,776
with steelworks and chemical plants
on the outskirts.

211
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,030
Air's filled with chimney smoke
from the factories

212
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:14,241
and the crows
are always circling above it.

213
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:16,326
-And spies too, right?
-Huh?

214
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:20,330
I heard this city has the most spies
of any in the region.

215
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,249
With North Korea next door,

216
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:25,377
you get spies
from China, Japan, the US, Russia.

217
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:29,381
They say everyone here is either a spy
or some kind of government agent.

218
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,508
Who said that? Headquarters?

219
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,676
Is it true?

220
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,220
<i>007? Mission Impossible?</i>

221
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:42,603
Man! You've got some high expectations.
Hope you're not disappointed.

223
00:17:56,867 --> 00:18:00,120
SAMJIN TRAVEL AGENCY

224
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,206
Welcome to the Shenyang branch

225
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,541
of Korea's National Intelligence Service.

226
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,251
Ms. Wang, get him some tea.

227
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,092
Oh, Mr. Chang!
How can I help you?

228
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,013
"Fang Defeng"?

229
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,516
Your pronunciation.
You could pass as Chinese.

230
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,185
-Not your real name, is it?
-Of course not.

231
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,064
How long have you pretended
this is a travel agency?

232
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,191
I'm not sure.

233
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:32,277
I know it was like this
when I got here three years ago.

234
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,696
Oh. And it's not a front.

235
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,533
As you can see,
it's a real working company.

236
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,493
We mainly do tours to Mt. Baekdu,

237
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:42,955
but with economy in the toilet,
we don't get a lot of customers.

238
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,665
And what about those employees?

239
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:48,627
Uh, those two ladies
are both real travel agents.

240
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,547
But that girl with the short hair
and that sleazy-looking guy work for us.

241
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,006
Hey, you two, say hi.

242
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,634
He's that crack prosecutor from Seoul.

243
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:01,557
Hey, where are the paper cups?

244
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,142
They're down below.

245
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:08,689
Uh, not the best manners.
Must be something in the water.

246
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,607
Please excuse them.

247
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:14,153
"Wei Longping."
Is that the Branch Manager Ji Kang-in?

248
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,737
Yeah. Yep. Right.

249
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,239
And where is he now?

250
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,700
Uh, he's actually on a business trip.

251
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:22,911
Where did he go?

252
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:26,832
I'm afraid
we have to keep that confidential for now.

253
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,835
Don't you understand why I'm here?

254
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:37,384
I want full reports on
all the agents' activities, transfers of…

255
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,678
Sorry. Excuse me.

256
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,557
Hey, Mr. Kim!

257
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,809
Why is it so hard to get ahold of you?

258
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,978
Is that right?

259
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:51,607
You better not be lying to me
like last time.

260
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,983
Okay. Okay.

261
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,694
You think I won't pay you back?

262
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:59,198
Come on. Okay, okay.

263
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,617
All right, I'll see you then.

264
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,786
All right. Never work on an empty stomach.

265
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,622
Let's go out
for an early dinner, shall we?

266
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,624
Let me give you
the Shenyang culinary tour.

267
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,376
-Let's see here…
-Where's the restroom?

268
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,086
Down the hall on the left.

269
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,714
Wait a second. Take the key with you.

270
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,738
Hey. What do you think you're doing?

271
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,074
Where is everybody off to?

272
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:43,784
Come on, get out.

273
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:47,746
When an inspector asks where you're going,
you should answer him right away. Got it?

274
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,873
We're gonna be late.

275
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:55,796
We got an urgent call from Manager Ji.
Okay? Now get out.

276
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:59,007
Since when does an urgent call
require this much cash?

277
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,927
I hear Manager Ji
is quite the habitual gambler.

278
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,845
Did he get cleaned out today?

279
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,765
-Great. Let's go together.
-Excuse me, sir!

280
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:09,268
-I'm gonna introduce myself.
-Wait, wait. Oh!

281
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,936
Sir, come on. Please get out right now.

282
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,938
-You really can't do this.
-Here.

283
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,859
-So he's a tough guy, huh?
-Please don't do this.

284
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,569
-This is not the restroom.
-Dives right in.

285
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:20,862
Jeong-dae, unlock the door…

286
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,489
Jeez. Well, whatever.

287
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,032
Open the door! Hey, hey!

288
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,743
Jae-gyu! Jae-gyu! Hey! Hey!

289
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,453
Hui-won, stop!

290
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,289
Shit.

291
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,319
Who's he?

292
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:06,033
I'm Prosecutor Han Ji-hoon.
I was sent here as an inspector.

293
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:09,536
Go ahead.

294
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,126
Wait. What are you doing?

295
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:18,837
-Let go of me. Let go.
-Dude, just put it on.

296
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,131
-You do that side.
-Raise your arms.

297
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:24,009
-Why do I need to wear this?
-Can you stop talking?

298
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:25,177
God, the dust.

299
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:29,514
What's going on? Is this a party?
Why so many people, huh?

300
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,060
Look at that. You even brought a civilian?

301
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,854
He's not here. Just lead the way.

302
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:36,813
Ugh.

303
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,941
Well, first things first.
Give me the money, okay?

304
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,913
Oh. Okay.

305
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:12,599
If the goods are damaged,
I'm not gonna be happy at all.

306
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,601
That's not my responsibility.

307
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:16,895
You should be
asking yourself that question.

308
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:36,206
Professor Wang, are you screwing with me?

309
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,041
Give us Room 39.

310
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,461
What the hell is this bullshit?

311
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:44,256
Okay, then. You guys work it out.
I'm out of here!

312
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:49,010
Wang, you stupid asshole.

313
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:49,928
Tell us!

314
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,096
Where is he?

315
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:55,308
Look.

316
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,770
Tell me what's going on here.

317
00:23:58,854 --> 00:23:59,896
<i> Shots fired.</i>

318
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,565
Get in the car now and stay down.

319
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,076
Hold your fire.

320
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,847
Threat neutralized.

321
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,682
TEXTILE FACTORY THREE

322
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,320
No need to check. They're North Koreans.

323
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:41,039
This rat had his escape all planned out.

324
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:43,375
He had another car parked in the back.

325
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,089
Why did you do it?

326
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:50,924
I'm really sorry.

327
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:54,803
They threatened
to kill my wife and kids. I had no choice.

328
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:59,140
Someone made you play both sides
and set up a firefight?

329
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,141
Who?

330
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:02,936
I just…

331
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,482
I really can't… can't tell you that.

332
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,152
Okay.

333
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,070
I understand.

334
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,990
No!

335
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,283
Wait!

336
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:17,701
Please don't do it.

337
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,786
-We've known each other--
-Stop. What are you doing?

338
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:21,955
You can't just threaten someone with--

339
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:31,631
Fall out.

340
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:33,883
Where are we going?

341
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,344
Huh? Where?

342
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:39,806
Please, Yaksha! I'm sorry!

343
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:42,892
Please! Please don't do it!

344
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,311
No!

345
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:54,112
Hey. Turn your head?

346
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:41,034
Hey. Hey.

347
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,328
Ouch, my head.

348
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:44,704
-Hey.
-Damn it.

349
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:48,708
I'm cold.

350
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:55,048
Where the hell am I?

351
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:57,801
Get up.

352
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,470
-Hey.
-Leave me alone.

353
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:11,856
Open up!

354
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:16,945
Open up! It's the police!

355
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,365
Open the door!

356
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,629
Oh…

357
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,131
Freeze!

358
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,383
He might jump. I'll go downstairs.

359
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:41,803
Hey.

360
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,931
Stay back! Stay back!

361
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:45,849
Stay there!

362
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:47,726
Stop! Stop!

363
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,519
Stop right there!

364
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,066
Come here!

365
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,196
Come here! Let's go down and talk.

366
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,156
I didn't do it.

367
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,575
Come back here!
Let's go down and talk.

368
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,750
Stop, come back!

369
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:14,669
Wait, don't!

370
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:26,222
Come on, get him!

371
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,308
What are you doing? Hurry up!

372
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:31,269
Hurry up! Hey! Stop!

373
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:33,229
That way!

374
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,284
Hey!

375
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,514
Son of a bitch.

376
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,191
I figured you'd get caught like an idiot.

377
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,109
But you made it.

378
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:22,904
I don't like your games.

379
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,073
You did pretty good for a nerd.

380
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,449
Do you workout by any chance?

381
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:29,452
What are you, a gangster? A hoodlum?

382
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,412
Both.

383
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,627
I don't know what it is
you came here to inspect,

384
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,671
but I really don't have time for it.

385
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:44,384
I'll have Hong write up a nice,
squeaky-clean report for you.

386
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,137
Then you can take it and leave quietly.

387
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:50,807
Not a chance.

388
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:52,934
I'm gonna write up a report

389
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:56,688
with every single thing I saw
and experienced today, in great detail.

390
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:59,357
You get the death penalty
for drug crimes here.

391
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,527
-I'm going to call the cops now.
-Go ahead.

392
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,197
I'm used to dealing
with thugs just like you.

393
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,367
I guess
I won't even need to call.

394
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:23,423
<i>Please respond.</i>

395
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:45,737
<i>Be careful of the leader there.</i>

396
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,572
<i>Branch Manager Ji Kang-in.</i>

397
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:51,409
He has run several foreign operations,

398
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,495
<i>and every time, he's a headache</i>
<i>for the Ministry.</i>

399
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,789
Because they always
have to clean up after him.

400
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:59,834
But one way or another,
he always gets the job done.

401
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:03,796
<i>So the higher-ups give him free rein.</i>

402
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:07,008
<i>His nickname is Yaksha?</i>

403
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,677
A hideous, violent demon that eats people.

404
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:16,059
<i>But it's also called a guardian</i>
<i>of Buddhist faith.</i>

405
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:19,854
Wherever it came from,
it's the perfect nickname.

406
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:23,024
<i>He's unpredictable, impossible to control.</i>

407
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,985
He's essentially a ticking time bomb.

408
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:27,862
You can't trust him.

409
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,744
What is that?

410
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:37,789
Don't worry about her.
She bites, but she's not poisonous.

411
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:40,541
Aw! Come here, Lizzie. You hungry?

412
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:46,339
You got outside again, didn't you?
Don't make me put a leash on you.

413
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,177
Jeez.

414
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,225
So you're a spy sent by Headquarters?

415
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,397
Is that what you guys call
special inspector around here?

416
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,817
They told you
to find out everything?

417
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,611
To investigate all the trouble
they're cooking up in Shenyang,

418
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,863
and also what problems
they're causing here.

419
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:14,200
Let's start.

420
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:16,828
You sure about this?

421
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:20,415
All right. Once you watch this,
you'll be wading into the sewer.

422
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:27,964
This was taken a week ago,
in front of Dongbei Bank.

423
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:31,426
It's the former Shenyang branch
of Daesong Bank in North Korea.

424
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,722
There was a shootout
between two unidentified groups.

425
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:38,850
The target of both groups
was that middle-aged man.

426
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,562
The first group that arrived on the scene

427
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:45,398
was later identified as
North Korea's Supreme Guard.

428
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:49,152
They were the ones
who attacked us yesterday.

429
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:50,903
But the other group…

430
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:55,616
we haven't been able to identify them yet.

431
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,036
And do we know who that guy is
they're fighting over?

432
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:04,459
That's the head of Room 39. Moon Byung-uk.

433
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:10,381
During the shootout,
he climbed over the wall and ran away.

434
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,050
He hasn't been seen since then.

435
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,218
You know who Moon Byung-uk is?

436
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:18,014
-Who is he?
-You really want us to go on?

437
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:28,566
"Room 39" is a group that's part of
North Korea's Central Committee.

438
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:31,527
It raises lots of foreign investment,

439
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:34,280
and maintains
the Kim family's giant slush fund.

440
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:36,240
Four trillion won offshore,

441
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:39,327
and the one who controls it all

442
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:42,121
is Moon Byung-uk.

443
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:45,792
But how did all of you
get involved in this situation?

444
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:50,713
A month ago, Moon reached out to us,
asking for protection.

445
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,383
We were all waiting
at the rendezvous point,

446
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,511
but Room 39 never showed up.

447
00:34:57,553 --> 00:35:00,473
That's when all this happened
in front of the bank.

448
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,141
Do you know what that means?

449
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,977
Agents from both North Korea and China,

450
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,897
and also some unknown third party
fought over Moon.

451
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,942
If word of our involvement
gets leaked to the government,

452
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,777
it could trigger
a major diplomatic crisis.

453
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,571
So our objective
is to find and secure Moon

454
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,990
according to plan before all that happens.

455
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,415
Hey, Prosecutor.

456
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,501
You do your time in the army?

457
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:30,795
You're in deep shit now.

458
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:35,633
This afternoon was just a taste.
The real war starts right now.

459
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:39,053
Remember when we told you
to pack your bags and go home?

460
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,430
You should've thanked us
and been on your way.

461
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:54,443
MINE CLOSED
NO ENTRY

462
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,573
Shoot!

463
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,747
You seem different
from other shit heads,

464
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,249
so I decided to fill you in.

465
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:12,211
You should just lie low until
we wrap things up. It won't take long.

466
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:15,506
Did it ever cross your mind that
you should have filed a formal report?

467
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:21,262
Do all prosecutors talk down to people
the way you're doing with me?

468
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,014
You're the one who started it.

469
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:25,433
Can you just answer the question?
Why didn't you report this?

470
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:28,436
Report and wait for approval?
There's no time.

471
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,438
Okay, I'll report on it now.

472
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,149
Prepare to move out.

473
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:46,537
It's okay, go ahead. He knows everything.

474
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:49,415
I just talked to Hong.

475
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:52,793
Looks like Professor Wang got the order
from the Japanese.

476
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,757
Last week, he met
with a Japanese agent in Xita district.

477
00:36:58,257 --> 00:36:59,342
Plus, the Russians say

478
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:01,636
someone is being held
at Big East Building as we speak.

479
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,387
Big East?

480
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:05,431
Dainichi Electronics?

481
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,811
We better get moving then.

482
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,564
We'll go in as soon as we're all set up.

483
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:15,900
Then I'll…

484
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,363
Come with me.

485
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,365
What are you going to do?

486
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,953
I guess we should feed him. He's a guest.

487
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:37,505
Put your seatbelt on.

488
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:45,179
Come on.

489
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,475
You know what you remind me of?

490
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:53,145
The white Nikes the hall monitor wore
when I was in school.

491
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:55,147
I stomped all over them.

492
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,820
-Where are we going now?
-You're an inspector. Time to inspect.

493
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:18,546
Here's what you asked for.

494
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,801
Your side hasn't found Room 39?

495
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:27,847
Not sure.

496
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:32,768
No, we haven't.

497
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,562
Okay.

498
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,941
Is D7 in Shenyang, by any chance?

499
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:44,989
How about that!

500
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:48,993
Well, where is he now?

501
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:51,329
I'll find out and contact you.

502
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:01,213
Switch off the lights
and leave through the kitchen.

503
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,680
So who was that?

504
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,265
An agent from State Security.

505
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:12,767
North Korea?

506
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,770
What did you just give that woman?

507
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:17,855
It's all give and take.

508
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:21,942
You can't do anything
in this field without intel.

509
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:25,654
It’s like blood.

510
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,534
It needs to flow.
What happens when it clots?

511
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:31,452
You burst.

512
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:42,797
Now let's get to work.

513
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:48,010
BIG EAST

514
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,435
-What brings you here?
-We're fixing a line on the 34th floor.

515
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:05,611
Thank you.

516
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,498
The 67th floor is a separate block.

517
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,125
If we black out one block,

518
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,377
all the lights and security will go out.

519
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,170
Let's limit our contact with them.

520
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,097
Who are you?

521
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,726
Who the hell are you?

522
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:48,737
Hey.

523
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,323
You're D7, right?

524
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:53,826
I'll count to three.

525
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,745
Where is Moon Byung-uk?

526
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:58,998
One.

527
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,750
Two.

528
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,851
Keep your manners.

529
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:21,937
Disrespect

530
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,857
is always repaid in kind.

531
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:39,330
<i>The center of world</i>
<i>power is returning to Northeast Asia.</i>

532
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:44,960
<i>This, more than anything else,</i>

533
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:47,171
calls for strong solidarity in Asia.

534
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,758
It's also the reason
I came to be with you today.

535
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,468
Shall we raise a toast to that?

536
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:59,183
I thought I wouldn't see you
until next year in Hong Kong.

537
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:00,351
Thanks for coming.

538
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:03,270
He didn't think he'd see you…

539
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,751
-I'll see you again.
-See you.

540
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,884
You're still alive?

541
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:40,182
Sure. I don't die so easily.

542
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:44,562
I told you
about him before, right?

543
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,649
Mr. Ozawa Yoshinobu.

544
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:53,028
He started at CIRO,
Japan's intelligence agency,

545
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:56,490
but now he works as a lobbyist.

546
00:42:58,492 --> 00:42:59,451
Say hello.

547
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:06,417
This is Jiang Wen,
from Chinese Special Forces.

548
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,966
I've heard much
about you. I'm Jiang Wen.

549
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:17,761
It's an honor to meet you.

550
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:19,555
Not at all.

551
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:22,349
It's nice to meet you.

552
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:25,352
Apologies for my broken Chinese.

553
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:26,854
Not at all.

554
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:29,982
My Japanese is far from perfect.

555
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:44,413
So what brings you here?

556
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:47,416
You're not the type of guy
who hangs out at places like this.

557
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:51,879
Jiang Wen here is a wine lover.

558
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:56,550
What about you?
What are you doing in Shenyang?

559
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,220
I just needed a change of scenery.

560
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:06,644
You didn't harm
Professor Wang's family, did you?

561
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:12,066
You almost got me killed
in broad daylight.

562
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:17,696
Hey.

563
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:21,700
Have you forgotten
that I'm with a commissioned officer?

564
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:27,122
Touch them,
and that'll be the end for you all.

565
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:29,625
Four years ago,

566
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:34,922
you ruined me in Hong Kong,
and I barely recovered.

567
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:37,841
Since then,

568
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:40,135
I never stopped thinking of you.

569
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:46,100
Sounds like you're in love with me.

570
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:48,602
It is love.

571
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:51,313
A match made in heaven.

572
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:54,024
And now we meet again.

573
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:59,029
This time I'm going to skin you alive.

574
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:01,740
Just you wait.

575
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:09,289
As usual,
you have no sense of dignity.

576
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,085
How long do you intend to work like this?

577
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:16,547
You're like a cheap hoodlum.

578
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:18,716
We're two of a kind.

579
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:19,925
You asshole.

580
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:40,070
Leaving already?
Something came up?

581
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,616
Seeing your face, Yaksha…

582
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:48,871
has ruined the taste of the wine.

583
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:00,632
You're a lot quicker than I thought.

584
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,429
So that was D7, right?

585
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,933
He's a Japanese spy
disguised as a lobbyist.

586
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:12,394
For espionage, he's the best in Asia.

587
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:14,688
So why did he just rush off?

588
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:17,983
It's a sign that our team
has just reached the target.

589
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:21,570
You mean they reached Room 39?

590
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,900
Things just got much more serious.

591
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,443
-Let's hurry.
-Yes, sir.

592
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:17,334
Where's Moon Byung-uk?

593
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:30,889
What's this?

594
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:35,060
Moon wasn't there.
We just found this woman.

595
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:39,189
-Who is she?
-She won't say.

596
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:41,733
Who she is,
or why she was locked up in there…

597
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:45,863
Then you should've
ripped her mouth open or something.

598
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,322
Why didn't you do anything?

599
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:00,586
I asked around.

600
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:05,215
Sounds like they managed to capture her
just after the shootout at Dongbei Bank.

601
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:08,927
I think maybe they took her
and they're using her as a hostage

602
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:10,220
to help them get Moon.

603
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:15,601
Are you Moon's girlfriend?

604
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:17,686
Fuck off, your breath stinks.

605
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:20,772
Where is he now?

606
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:32,576
Is this how you people solve everything?

607
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:34,953
At the end of the day, you're all
just a bunch of thugs.

608
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:39,291
Do you want to die?

609
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:45,213
Make sure she talks before dawn.

610
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:47,966
And lock this guy up.

611
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:49,885
See you around.

612
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:57,726
How long can you live this way?

613
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:01,605
You're one to talk.

614
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:03,982
I'm going to quit.

615
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:07,110
That can get you killed. Be careful.

616
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,657
You be careful.

617
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,076
Things are really tense right now.

618
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:19,081
I know for sure that our side is convinced
that the South is secretly hiding Moon.

619
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,625
Idiots.

620
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:26,088
State Security is going to
send more agents.

621
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:32,594
I've been ordered to keep my eye
on any agents from the South.

622
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:36,556
You're already doing that right now.

623
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,141
It's not enough.

624
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:49,528
Do you know who this is?

625
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:52,698
You're holding her?

626
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:54,908
Who is she?

627
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,204
Moon's daughter.

628
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:02,457
<i>He raised her in Beijing</i>
<i>to keep it secret from the party.</i>

629
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,793
She's the only family he has left.

630
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:09,047
<i> What is that?</i>

631
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:10,590
Old sparky.

632
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:13,510
It's great for loosening tongues.

633
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:15,554
You guys don't use this?

634
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,272
Keep moving, and I'll stab you.

635
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,713
Judo? It's not bad.

636
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:02,559
I hated you
from the moment I lay eyes on you.

637
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,313
You arrogant asshole.

638
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:18,116
Drop the knife, or die.

639
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:44,935
Are you okay?

640
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:47,437
Don't worry.

641
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:49,439
I'm a South Korean prosecutor.

642
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:53,401
I'll take you
to the South Korean consulate,

643
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:56,238
and then call the Chinese police.

644
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,117
Pull over.

645
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:13,964
Just wait a minute.

646
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:44,202
<i>Director Yeom? It's Han Ji-hoon.</i>

647
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:46,246
Prosecutor Han!

648
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:48,331
<i>What's going on?</i>

649
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:51,793
<i> Ji Kang-in</i>
<i>is definitely plotting something.</i>

650
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:56,047
<i>From her accent,</i>
<i>the missing hostage was North Korean.</i>

651
00:52:56,631 --> 00:53:00,385
So does that mean you're no longer
anywhere near Ji Kang-in? Is that correct?

652
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:05,056
That's correct. Anyway,
considering that Japan is involved,

653
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,767
the situation is much more serious
than you anticipated.

654
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,520
<i>What about you? Are you okay?</i>

655
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:11,771
Yes, I'm doing all right.

656
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:13,982
That's good.

657
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:17,569
I'll call the Consulate General,
so you need to head over there right now.

658
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:18,528
I can't.

659
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:20,864
Given the situation,

660
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:24,075
I really think I should stay
and look into things more closely.

661
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:27,287
Yeah.

662
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:29,414
Hello? Hello?

663
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:30,332
Baby.

664
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,709
You need anything?

665
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:41,092
No, I'm fine.

666
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:42,636
It's okay.

667
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:45,513
Tell me what you want. My name's Eleven.

668
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,975
This is my neighborhood.

669
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:53,897
Out of the way.

670
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:55,440
I can't believe this.

671
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:57,442
You're not from here.

672
00:53:58,151 --> 00:54:00,570
You look so tired.

673
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:03,448
Lie down for a bit.

674
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:06,076
Let go!

675
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:07,827
Huh?

676
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,881
Hang on. Hey.

677
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:25,220
This will buy you
an overnight. I'll make you happy.

678
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:26,388
Let's go.

679
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:29,099
-Don't get yourself hurt.
-Come quietly.

680
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:30,392
You're making a mistake.

681
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:31,768
Hey, Nike!

682
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,147
Any idea where you are?

683
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:39,150
Let him go.

684
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:43,405
They'll lead
a dummy like you off somewhere,

685
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:47,242
then cut out your kidneys
and everything else.

686
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:54,916
Let's go.

687
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:03,591
Why do shitheads like you always
had to butt in and screw everything up!

688
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:17,480
I told you to lay low,
you self-righteous asshole!

689
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,485
I'm a prosecutor.

690
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:26,031
You abduct, assault,
and even torture people!

691
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:29,034
Do you expect me to sit back and watch?
You piece of shit!

692
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:33,913
Wait. Wait.

693
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:42,464
Son of a bitch!

694
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:57,479
Whoa!

695
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:07,322
All right. Tell me where she is.

696
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:09,574
She ran off.

697
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:13,578
She's Moon Byung-uk's daughter,
you goddamn idiot!

698
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:15,747
You ruined everything, you shithead!

699
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,417
Did she say anything to you?

700
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:24,172
I told you. She told me
to get out and drove away.

701
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,766
Why is Japan getting involved in all this?

702
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,897
And what is it with you
and that Ozawa guy?

703
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:48,822
We've got a lot of memories together.

704
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:51,408
Stay out of it. None of your business.

705
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:53,785
We both know I can't do that.

706
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:59,416
You're looking at 25 years
for what you pulled just today.

707
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:02,001
I'm not gonna ignore it.

708
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:05,839
I'm gonna investigate
and prosecute you according to the law.

709
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:09,717
And then you think
they'll reinstate you after you do that?

710
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:13,179
I know everything about you.

711
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:15,265
What happened with Sang-in Group,

712
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:17,767
your demotion to NIS,
and volunteering to come here.

713
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:22,188
You want to prove yourself
and be reinstated as a prosecutor.

714
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:23,148
Am I right?

715
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:26,359
That's right.

716
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:29,529
I have to go back, and soon.

717
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:31,823
Then I'll nail Sang-in Group.

718
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:35,452
When society's rich and powerful elite
commit crimes,

719
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:40,290
a lot more people suffer
than you actually think.

720
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,126
And for hell of a lot longer too.

721
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:48,506
Any lawbreaking bastard
that I catch is going rue the day…

722
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,049
Shit.

723
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:52,927
Thank you.

724
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:02,979
Close the door.

725
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:13,865
What is this?

726
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:22,290
What? Looking for a tracker?

727
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,585
Those are a little dated.

728
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:31,758
We wipe that on you, and we can track you
by satellite for a full 18 hours.

729
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:34,636
It's always the first thing we do
when we have a guest.

730
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:35,803
In case they run off.

731
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:39,224
She's stopped.

732
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:41,559
Where?

733
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:43,353
The Korean neighborhood
in Heping District.

734
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:44,771
Twenty-three minutes away.

735
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:48,441
Let's go. Get us there in five.

736
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:50,735
Okay, five it is.

737
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:31,359
This is an operation.

738
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:32,777
Keep your cool, okay?

739
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:43,580
SATELLITE TRACKING SYSTEM

740
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:46,499
Hey.

741
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:50,795
Tell me. How long have you
been working with Ji Kang-in?

742
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:54,424
So what, now you're inspecting us?

743
00:59:57,176 --> 00:59:58,469
Humor me, will you?

744
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:03,057
<i>Hui-won's</i>
<i>been here the longest.</i>

<i>Next is Jae-gyu.</i>

746
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:08,104
<i>Me, about three years?</i>

747
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:13,693
<i> I got roped in</i>
<i>while I was traveling in Cairo.</i>

748
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:19,115
Did he run around
shooting people then, too?

749
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:23,202
What do you think?
That's what black teams do.

750
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:34,922
<i>Since we'd all be dead</i>
<i>if it weren't for him,</i>

751
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:36,507
<i>we do everything he tells us.</i>

752
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:44,140
If he tells us to die, we do it.

753
01:01:05,536 --> 01:01:07,872
What? She's moving.

<i>A shootout in Heping District 26-7!</i>

<i>Combatants are armed and unidentified.</i>
<i>Backup requested.</i>

It's Moon.

The cops are here. Fall back.
Do you hear me?

762
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:47,995
What's wrong?

763
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,997
I think the signal's being blocked.

764
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:51,624
I can't reach them.

765
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:56,295
He's been shot in the stomach,
at point blank range.

766
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:57,213
It's a trap.

767
01:01:58,339 --> 01:02:00,299
How fast can you run?

768
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:01,551
<i> All units,</i>

<i>of unidentified, armed combatants.</i>

770
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:08,099
We have to go.
The police are here.

771
01:02:10,768 --> 01:02:12,812
Hey, Moon. Can you hear me?

772
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:15,857
Where's that thing
you were going to give me?

773
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:18,401
I am…

774
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:21,112
…useless now.

775
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:24,782
My daughter.

776
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:28,119
My daughter Ju-yeon.

777
01:02:30,621 --> 01:02:32,707
Whatever happens, don't let…

778
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:37,837
…don't let the Japanese get her.

-Huh?

You heard me. Come on, jump.

790
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:02,440
I'm… I'm a little afraid of heights.

Sir, the police are here and
they're searching our office right now.

800
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:50,529
I'm pretty sure he's the one
who planned the whole thing.

801
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:51,697
Did you clean up?

802
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:54,492
Yeah, don't worry, it's clean.

803

<i>They're bound</i>
<i>to search there, too.</i>

809
01:06:23,729 --> 01:06:24,689
<i>Close the shutter.</i>

810
01:06:24,772 --> 01:06:25,856
Sure about this?

811
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:52,174
They must've hacked
into our tracking system.

812
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:55,970
The Chinese police had perfect timing.
It can't be a coincidence.

813
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:08,024
Oh shit. What about Lizzie?

814
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:13,946
What do you want?

815
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:16,282
This is all your fault.

816
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:18,451
Let me go!

817
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:21,704
Let go, damn it!

818
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:24,707
He screwed everything up.

819
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:29,462
Now what? You're gonna pay--

820
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:32,590
Calm down, will you?

821
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:35,885
What's the real reason
you went looking for Moon?

822
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:40,056
The real reason?

823
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:44,310
Yeah. Not the lies you put in reports,

824
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:46,729
but the real reason
you're keeping this secret.

825
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:50,649
I heard he was supposed
to give you something. Wasn't he?

826
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,359
So, what?

827
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:55,696
Could it be the secret fund
he was in charge of maybe?

828
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:57,198
Four trillion.

829
01:07:57,907 --> 01:08:00,284
You're all just fighting
over that money, aren't you?

830
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:04,955
I heard you embezzled funds
for foreign operations.

831
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:08,084
And the higher-ups in Korea
just chose to let it slide.

832
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:09,293
Shut up.

833
01:08:10,461 --> 01:08:12,671
You seem convinced that
we're some kind of trash.

834
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:15,132
Aren't you?

835
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:16,425
If not, go ahead.

836
01:08:17,176 --> 01:08:18,177
Kill me.

837
01:08:19,053 --> 01:08:19,970
That's enough.

838
01:08:22,348 --> 01:08:24,266
<i>Looks like game over, no?</i>

839
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:25,267
Ozawa.

840
01:08:26,477 --> 01:08:28,062
You came quite prepared.

841
01:08:28,729 --> 01:08:31,774
You shouldn't take other people's things.

842
01:08:31,857 --> 01:08:33,150
Still,

843
01:08:33,984 --> 01:08:36,654
hitting our home seems a bit extreme.

844
01:08:38,322 --> 01:08:39,782
It's for the best.

845
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:44,495
How about leaving here in the morning?

846
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:47,790
I won't leave

847
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:51,001
without taking care of you.

848
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:53,129
<i>You don't have many options.</i>

849
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:56,048
Since you killed Moon Byung-uk.

850
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:57,967
What?

851
01:08:58,050 --> 01:09:02,179
At 8:00 a.m., a wanted
notice will go out all over China.

852
01:09:03,264 --> 01:09:05,975
Newspapers, TV, internet…

853
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:09,854
Your faces will be everywhere.

854
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:12,731
<i>Your days working in China are finished.</i>

855
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:15,693
Boarding a ship won't be easy.

856
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:19,822
I recommend crossing
the Russian border before dawn.

857
01:09:19,905 --> 01:09:22,158
<i>As an admirer of your talent,</i>

858
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:24,910
I'm doing you this last favor.

859
01:09:33,043 --> 01:09:35,629
We've already called
your people several times,

860
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:37,339
but let me tell you directly.

861
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:40,467
One of the wanted suspects

862
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:42,511
is a prosecutor sent by us.

863
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:44,555
He came for an internal review,

864
01:09:44,638 --> 01:09:48,058
but we think he got pulled
into this incident against his will.

865
01:09:49,059 --> 01:09:51,270
We really need your cooperation on this.

866
01:09:52,938 --> 01:09:53,772
Okay.

867
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:57,443
<i>The shootout</i>
<i>continued until midnight,</i>

868
01:09:57,526 --> 01:09:59,945
<i>and one could tell</i>
<i>the situation was very urgent.</i>

869
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:02,907
<i>The shattered windows</i>
<i>and the holes in the walls</i>

870
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:04,867
<i>show the aftermath of the shootout.</i>

871
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:08,913
China's Security Ministry
is blaming everything on the police.

872
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:12,166
Which clearly means
they don't want to help.

873
01:10:12,249 --> 01:10:15,336
Director, I think I've finally found
a way to get a hold of Hong.

874
01:10:15,419 --> 01:10:17,421
<i>I went out to check on my kid.</i>

875
01:10:17,504 --> 01:10:19,882
Our top priority
is getting Han out of there.

876
01:10:19,965 --> 01:10:21,050
Let's get you on a plane.

877
01:10:21,133 --> 01:10:26,013
<i>I suddenly heard some</i>
<i>commotion, sound of glass breaking.</i>

878
01:10:26,096 --> 01:10:28,891
<i>I was terrified.</i>
<i>This has never happened before.</i>

879
01:10:28,974 --> 01:10:31,977
<i>I couldn't believe</i>
<i>it was happening right in front of me.</i>

880
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:32,978
Here.

881
01:10:34,104 --> 01:10:35,773
You're really starting to smell.

882
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:41,570
Damn it.

883
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:45,199
I don't exactly know
what you think of us at this point,

884
01:10:45,282 --> 01:10:46,659
but let me say one thing.

885
01:10:47,868 --> 01:10:49,995
Embezzling the operation funds…

886
01:10:50,537 --> 01:10:53,624
You're right, it's true.
And it was a lot of money.

887
01:10:55,459 --> 01:10:56,543
But all of it

888
01:10:57,628 --> 01:10:59,171
was sent to the grieving families

889
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:02,800
of every single squad member who died
on the line of duty over the years.

890
01:11:04,009 --> 01:11:06,845
Headquarters found out later
and decided to let it slide.

891
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:11,558
As far as he's concerned,
money means nothing to him.

892
01:11:12,184 --> 01:11:13,602
Do you understand what I mean?

893
01:11:14,853 --> 01:11:15,980
Eat your food.

894
01:11:27,408 --> 01:11:30,411
Sorry to show up in this state

895
01:11:31,662 --> 01:11:33,497
after so long.

896
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:36,333
I'm a bit embarrassed.

897
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:39,545
How can you say that between us?

898
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:42,798
If it weren't for you,

899
01:11:42,881 --> 01:11:46,010
I'd be dead already.

900
01:11:47,678 --> 01:11:50,764
For now, eat and get some rest.

901
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:03,193
Hey, Chang.

902
01:12:03,277 --> 01:12:06,238
Stop the work and send everyone home.

903
01:12:09,533 --> 01:12:11,952
<i>Don't worry. It's safe here.</i>

904
01:12:13,245 --> 01:12:15,080
What are you planning to do with it?

905
01:12:20,627 --> 01:12:23,005
I've managed to secure a way out
for each of us.

906
01:12:23,088 --> 01:12:25,799
We'd be going through Vietnam,
but we don't have much time.

907
01:12:25,883 --> 01:12:28,802
We probably have a good chance if
we leave the country some time today.

908
01:12:29,636 --> 01:12:30,637
Sure, go ahead.

909
01:12:31,472 --> 01:12:32,348
Huh?

910
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:35,476
You're the only one of us
who has a family to take care of.

911
01:12:36,393 --> 01:12:38,979
Come on, sir,
after everything we've been through,

912
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:42,107
do you seriously believe
that I could do that to all of you?

913
01:12:46,403 --> 01:12:48,947
If we're not all going to leave Shenyang,

914
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:50,866
then I'll just get ready
for our next mission.

915
01:12:55,079 --> 01:12:57,998
Excuse me. What shall we do
with the prosecutor now?

916
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:01,585
Well, what do you think we should do?

917
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:05,839
According to the manual,
we should've dumped him already.

918
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:50,342
Can you hear me?

919
01:13:56,056 --> 01:13:59,017
You don't want to go deaf, do you?

920
01:14:00,727 --> 01:14:03,355
After all I did for you,

921
01:14:04,314 --> 01:14:06,233
you shouldn't do this.

922
01:14:08,527 --> 01:14:12,156
Ingratitude is the worst vice.

923
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:13,365
So,

924
01:14:14,199 --> 01:14:15,784
where did you hide it?

925
01:14:17,578 --> 01:14:18,495
Tell me.

926
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:26,086
As long as it stays hidden,

927
01:14:27,087 --> 01:14:29,423
I can just make you disappear.

928
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:32,468
If I die,

929
01:14:34,261 --> 01:14:35,804
it will all come out.

930
01:14:36,847 --> 01:14:38,515
Didn't you think about that?

931
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:46,482
You prepared well,

932
01:14:47,274 --> 01:14:48,984
just like a professional.

933
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:53,447
All right. I can wait.

934
01:15:07,294 --> 01:15:11,215
We confirmed that they're currently
inside the Japanese consulate.

935
01:15:11,298 --> 01:15:15,636
And aside from the consulate vehicles,
no other cars have left the premises.

936
01:15:16,136 --> 01:15:18,388
So the plan is to hit them
right when they come out?

937
01:15:18,472 --> 01:15:19,348
Yeah.

938
01:15:19,973 --> 01:15:23,894
A large Japanese cargo ship is currently
anchored at the Port of Dalian,

939
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:27,356
so looks like they're going to move
Moon Ju-yeon by ship.

940
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:29,858
I identified three points

941
01:15:29,942 --> 01:15:32,319
along the road from Shenyang to Dailan.

942
01:15:32,402 --> 01:15:34,947
Based on that, it looks like
 the safest place to intercept them--

943
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:36,365
No, not there.

944
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:38,200
Wherever we do it,

945
01:15:39,159 --> 01:15:41,995
remember, the timing will be tough
since we're outnumbered,

946
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:43,539
and if we lose them,

947
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:45,624
it's game over.

948
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:47,334
So forget all this.

949
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:50,796
Let's just break in.

950
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:52,756
What?

951
01:15:54,007 --> 01:15:55,509
We're gonna walk right in.

952
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:05,227
You know how to make me laugh.

953
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:09,189
You wanna break into the consulate?

954
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:14,111
That's Japanese land.
You know you'd be committing a crime.

955
01:16:14,194 --> 01:16:16,488
They tried to burn our consulate down.

956
01:16:19,616 --> 01:16:20,659
<i>Four years ago,</i>

957
01:16:21,493 --> 01:16:25,038
<i>the two Koreas were planning</i>
<i>secret working-level talks in Hong Kong.</i>

958
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:29,668
<i>Japan's been trying to block cooperation</i>
<i>between North and South for a long time.</i>

959
01:16:30,294 --> 01:16:33,880
<i>Because they think</i>
<i>a unified Korea would be a threat to them.</i>

960
01:16:35,382 --> 01:16:37,759
<i>In the end, the talks never happened.</i>

961
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:42,389
<i>Three of our team died, and the other one</i>

962
01:16:42,472 --> 01:16:43,849
<i>I killed myself.</i>

963
01:16:45,142 --> 01:16:48,478
<i>Because he was a mole</i>
<i>working for the Japanese.</i>

964
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:53,025
Moon Byung-uk

965
01:16:54,651 --> 01:16:56,111
was also a turncoat.

966
01:16:57,195 --> 01:17:01,033
He cut a deal and requested asylum
in exchange for classified information.

967
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:03,952
That's the reason
why the Japanese decided to kill him.

968
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:06,121
Then why did they kidnap his daughter?

969
01:17:06,204 --> 01:17:09,374
Because now she has all the secret
information he was going to give us.

970
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:11,710
As soon as they get
that information they want from her,

971
01:17:11,793 --> 01:17:13,420
she's as good as dead.

972
01:17:13,503 --> 01:17:14,421
Which means,

973
01:17:14,504 --> 01:17:17,090
we need to go get her back
before that happens.

974
01:17:18,425 --> 01:17:20,385
Do you get the situation now?

975
01:17:29,019 --> 01:17:31,021
Someone from HQ is coming.

976
01:17:33,523 --> 01:17:36,026
They called all of us in. What do we do?

977
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:39,196
They're just going
to complicate things for us.

978
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:42,949
You go and try to stall them
until we're done.

979
01:17:43,742 --> 01:17:45,118
Uh, but without me…

980
01:17:45,619 --> 01:17:47,829
So, what, it's just going to be
the four of you going in?

981
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:50,415
Why four? It's five.

982
01:18:17,484 --> 01:18:18,777
CONSULATE GENERAL OF JAPAN

983
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:20,570
What are you doing?

984
01:18:20,654 --> 01:18:22,656
You can't do that here.

985
01:18:22,739 --> 01:18:24,950
Go away! Go!

986
01:18:25,909 --> 01:18:28,954
Go away!

987
01:18:35,252 --> 01:18:36,086
What the hell?

988
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:42,134
Get out of here!

989
01:18:43,093 --> 01:18:44,511
Are you insane?

990
01:19:15,459 --> 01:19:17,169
Where is the Branch Manager?

991
01:19:17,252 --> 01:19:19,379
Uh, I'm not sure.

992
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:21,923
Well, how exactly
are you planning to fix this?

993
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:22,924
I apologize.

994
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:24,342
And Prosecutor Han?

995
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:26,678
I'm not sure. I'm sorry.

996
01:19:44,696 --> 01:19:46,281
I'm sorry, but this is just wrong.

997
01:19:47,365 --> 01:19:50,410
It's called breaking and entering.
Clearly illegal.

998
01:19:51,244 --> 01:19:52,245
By international law--

999
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:55,665
If you're so scared for your life,
you can get out right now, you chicken.

1000
01:19:55,749 --> 01:19:56,792
What?

1001
01:19:56,875 --> 01:19:59,669
If we work by the law,
we can't do anything.

1002
01:20:02,589 --> 01:20:05,175
There's this saying
I always try to live by.

1003
01:20:05,258 --> 01:20:07,719
Just actions preserve justice.

1004
01:20:08,512 --> 01:20:09,554
Justice?

1005
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:13,350
Is that really all justice is to you? Huh?

1006
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:19,815
The truth is that justice has to be
preserved by any means necessary.

1007
01:20:21,441 --> 01:20:23,068
That's my idea of justice.

1008
01:20:28,698 --> 01:20:30,617
All right. Stand by, okay?

1009
01:20:31,243 --> 01:20:33,411
Have you ever seen me wear one of those?

1010
01:20:33,912 --> 01:20:35,956
You should definitely wear one today.

1011
01:20:36,039 --> 01:20:37,582
If your number's up, you die.

1012
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:39,751
If not, you live.

1013
01:20:42,712 --> 01:20:45,215
Why don't you wear two? Come on, chicken.

1014
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:57,018
What the heck?

1015
01:21:02,148 --> 01:21:04,818
Damn it!

1016
01:21:08,572 --> 01:21:11,741
-Oh, it's getting away!
-Hey, it's getting away!

1017
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:21,668
-Catch it!
-You're telling me to catch it?

1018
01:21:22,586 --> 01:21:23,461
Stop.

1019
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:24,379
Stop!

1020
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:39,769
Hurry.

1021
01:21:40,353 --> 01:21:41,271
This way.

1022
01:21:42,606 --> 01:21:44,524
They came quicker than I thought.

1023
01:21:49,321 --> 01:21:50,238
Wait.

1024
01:21:50,822 --> 01:21:52,657
-Step back, please.
-Out of the way.

1025
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:54,075
Please hurry up.

1026
01:21:55,452 --> 01:21:57,537
-A gun?
-Be quiet.

1027
01:21:58,580 --> 01:21:59,414
Hey!

1028
01:22:00,415 --> 01:22:01,666
Why are you standing there?

1029
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:03,543
Get in here, quickly!

1030
01:22:10,842 --> 01:22:11,801
Is she dead?

1031
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:14,387
Check.

1032
01:22:39,329 --> 01:22:40,580
Out of the way!

1033
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:44,501
Move!

1034
01:22:54,928 --> 01:22:56,096
Go!

1035
01:23:14,322 --> 01:23:17,450
<i>Shenyang's</i>
<i>underground tunnels are like an anthill.</i>

1036
01:23:18,743 --> 01:23:22,288
<i>During World War II Japanese troops</i>
<i>used them as air-raid shelters.</i>

1037
01:23:22,372 --> 01:23:24,249
<i>They linked all the major points</i>
<i>in the city,</i>

1038
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:26,960
<i>so of course there'd be one</i>
<i>under the Japanese consulate.</i>

1039
01:23:27,752 --> 01:23:31,131
<i>We'll figure out where it is,</i>
<i>and strike quickly.</i>

1040
01:23:38,304 --> 01:23:39,431
Over there!

1041
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:59,117
Go after them!

1042
01:25:12,857 --> 01:25:15,527
It's okay. She's not poisonous.

1043
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:18,696
Get down, Lizzie.

1044
01:25:22,492 --> 01:25:23,576
Get down.

1045
01:25:29,332 --> 01:25:31,417
My father worked for many years

1046
01:25:32,502 --> 01:25:34,587
as a Japanese spy.

1047
01:25:36,506 --> 01:25:39,008
And last year,
I started helping him in secret.

1048
01:25:44,389 --> 01:25:48,476
At first he thought he was working for
the good of both North and South Korea,

1049
01:25:49,477 --> 01:25:52,188
but then he realized
he was only helping Japan.

1050
01:25:55,525 --> 01:25:56,860
They had deceived him.

1051
01:25:59,070 --> 01:26:02,198
In the end he was tormented
by all the harm that he had caused.

1052
01:26:02,782 --> 01:26:05,660
He said he couldn't be
Japan's puppet anymore.

1053
01:26:07,704 --> 01:26:09,873
And so he decided to defect.

1054
01:26:12,876 --> 01:26:14,335
To repent his sins.

1055
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:20,967
What secret information did he have?

1056
01:26:23,887 --> 01:26:24,971
A spy list.

1057
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:28,099
A list?

1058
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:31,311
There were other spies
apart from your father?

1059
01:26:32,353 --> 01:26:37,108
The current number of double agents
Ozawa maintains in East Asia is 107.

1060
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:40,236
The list has

1061
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:44,449
intelligence from mission dossiers,
objectives and reports.

1062
01:26:45,909 --> 01:26:49,537
It even includes
the funding source for each operation.

1063
01:26:50,538 --> 01:26:52,540
My father wanted to make it public.

1064
01:26:53,249 --> 01:26:55,168
Japan is still trying to stop him.

1065
01:26:57,754 --> 01:27:00,965
And do you know
where the list is now?

1066
01:27:19,108 --> 01:27:20,610
Please zoom in.

1067
01:27:26,616 --> 01:27:28,785
At 4:39 p.m.,

1068
01:27:28,868 --> 01:27:32,455
they left their Cesco vehicle
in a parking lot near Zhongshan Square.

1069
01:27:32,538 --> 01:27:36,125
Then they got in another vehicle
and fled toward the Heping District.

1070
01:27:38,169 --> 01:27:40,922
The last signal came from District 89.

1071
01:27:41,005 --> 01:27:44,259
Activate all our antennas in Shenyang.

1072
01:28:14,497 --> 01:28:16,457
I thought we're going somewhere safe.

1073
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,544
As of right now,
this may be our only option.

1074
01:28:26,843 --> 01:28:28,011
Hey, Eleven.

1075
01:28:30,972 --> 01:28:32,473
Baby!

1076
01:28:34,684 --> 01:28:35,560
Are you insane?

1077
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:38,062
Why come back here?

1078
01:28:39,397 --> 01:28:40,815
You want to die?

1079
01:28:51,242 --> 01:28:53,036
Yaksha told us to come here.

1080
01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:05,506
Don't worry.

1081
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:09,844
This neighborhood is so dirty and scary,

1082
01:29:09,927 --> 01:29:11,763
not even the cops come.

1083
01:29:11,846 --> 01:29:14,932
If anyone turns up,
I'll tell you right away.

1084
01:29:15,016 --> 01:29:16,100
Thanks.

1085
01:29:18,811 --> 01:29:19,771
What's your name?

1086
01:29:22,523 --> 01:29:23,358
Nike.

1087
01:29:25,151 --> 01:29:26,152
Nike?

1088
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:32,950
Mmm, then I'm Adidas.

1089
01:29:41,167 --> 01:29:42,460
Have a good time then.

1090
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:46,589
These walls are really thin,

1091
01:29:46,672 --> 01:29:49,550
so make sure you do it lightly,

1092
01:29:50,176 --> 01:29:51,386
gently…

1093
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:54,305
…and quietly.

1094
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:56,766
-Got it?
-All right.

1095
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:01,437
Let me know if you need anything!

1096
01:30:03,815 --> 01:30:05,108
So what now?

1097
01:30:07,568 --> 01:30:08,903
We'll think of something.

1098
01:30:18,788 --> 01:30:19,747
Don't worry.

1099
01:30:21,207 --> 01:30:23,543
We won't let the Japanese
capture you, okay?

1100
01:30:28,423 --> 01:30:29,298
It's in Chile.

1101
01:30:31,801 --> 01:30:32,635
Sorry?

1102
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:35,388
My father's spy list.

1103
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:45,189
I hid it in the database
of a university in Santiago.

1104
01:30:46,607 --> 01:30:47,567
But…

1105
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:49,610
…it's not easy to find.

1106
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:52,697
You have to use foreign servers

1107
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:55,074
and also bypass multiple firewalls.

1108
01:30:58,119 --> 01:30:59,912
Nobody can do it except me.

1109
01:31:30,026 --> 01:31:31,444
-Han's not here yet?
-No.

1110
01:31:31,527 --> 01:31:32,570
And the rest?

1111
01:31:32,653 --> 01:31:35,490
I told everyone else to look around
and search for him.

1112
01:31:37,241 --> 01:31:38,201
And the higher-ups?

1113
01:31:38,284 --> 01:31:40,453
I took them for a ride
and slipped out, don't worry.

1114
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:45,208
Hello?

1115
01:31:45,291 --> 01:31:46,542
<i>It's me, Han Ji-hoon.</i>

1116
01:31:46,626 --> 01:31:48,419
What happened to you?
I told you to come here!

1117
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:50,129
Listen to me very carefully.

1118
01:31:50,630 --> 01:31:54,300
The info that Moon had is a list
of the spies Japan has in each country.

1119
01:31:54,383 --> 01:31:57,094
-Moon Ju-yeon talked?
-<i>She told me everything, but…</i>

1120
01:31:57,178 --> 01:32:00,097
That time I took Moon Ju-yeon
and escaped your compound,

1121
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,350
I immediately told Headquarters.

1122
01:32:02,433 --> 01:32:04,727
<i>I told them everything.</i>
<i>I told them she got away.</i>

1123
01:32:04,810 --> 01:32:05,853
Damn it.

1124
01:32:05,937 --> 01:32:10,066
Do you think that's why the Japanese
were able to hack our tracking system,

1125
01:32:10,149 --> 01:32:12,235
and were always a step ahead?

1126
01:32:12,818 --> 01:32:14,278
Who exactly did you talk to?

1127
01:32:15,321 --> 01:32:17,156
Director Yeom Jeong-won.

1128
01:32:17,782 --> 01:32:19,325
She's also the one who sent me here.

1129
01:32:19,408 --> 01:32:23,120
<i>If there's also a mole inside the NIS…</i>

1130
01:32:27,124 --> 01:32:28,167
<i>Hello?</i>

1131
01:32:28,251 --> 01:32:29,126
Hello?

1132
01:32:36,842 --> 01:32:37,718
It was you.

1133
01:32:46,644 --> 01:32:47,603
Hello?

1134
01:32:49,730 --> 01:32:50,982
That's him!

1135
01:33:10,751 --> 01:33:12,753
grunting]

1136
01:33:36,152 --> 01:33:37,445
Get him!

1137
01:33:49,874 --> 01:33:51,834
Hmm. You're the mole?

1138
01:33:54,587 --> 01:33:55,588
How long?

1139
01:33:57,048 --> 01:34:00,343
With mountains of debt
and a sick kid who could die any day,

1140
01:34:01,052 --> 01:34:03,846
what the hell did you expect me to do?

1141
01:34:23,366 --> 01:34:25,201
Who turned you into this, huh?

1142
01:34:27,703 --> 01:34:29,163
Was it that NIS bitch?

1143
01:34:29,997 --> 01:34:31,666
-Hmm?
-I can't tell you.

1144
01:34:32,291 --> 01:34:33,376
If I do…

1145
01:34:36,879 --> 01:34:38,214
they'll kill my family.

1146
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:40,383
I'm sorry, boss.

1147
01:34:58,526 --> 01:34:59,735
Greetings.

1148
01:35:02,363 --> 01:35:03,572
Prosecutor Han.

1149
01:35:05,241 --> 01:35:07,451
Sorry to startle you,

1150
01:35:08,619 --> 01:35:10,037
but to be honest,

1151
01:35:10,121 --> 01:35:13,082
I knew who you were from the beginning.

1152
01:35:13,958 --> 01:35:15,543
Instead of the street,

1153
01:35:16,752 --> 01:35:19,797
shall we go somewhere quiet
and talk over a cup of tea?

1154
01:35:37,189 --> 01:35:38,524
It's a side wound.

1155
01:35:39,984 --> 01:35:42,445
I guess he wasn't trying to kill you.

1156
01:35:55,875 --> 01:35:57,460
Let's run away together.

1157
01:35:57,543 --> 01:35:58,878
Run where?

1158
01:36:00,379 --> 01:36:01,422
I just feel like

1159
01:36:03,048 --> 01:36:04,925
you're really going to die this time.

1160
01:36:05,509 --> 01:36:06,844
Are you afraid to die?

1161
01:36:09,555 --> 01:36:10,556
You're not?

1162
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:11,640
I'm scared

1163
01:36:12,850 --> 01:36:14,518
but only that I'll fail again…

1164
01:36:16,312 --> 01:36:18,189
and make a total mess of everything.

1165
01:36:19,982 --> 01:36:21,317
That's what scares me.

1166
01:36:24,904 --> 01:36:27,239
My team almost risked their lives for me.

1167
01:36:30,326 --> 01:36:31,535
<i>I need to finish</i>

1168
01:36:32,870 --> 01:36:34,205
<i>what they started.</i>

1169
01:37:56,036 --> 01:37:57,746
I've taken action,

1170
01:37:57,830 --> 01:38:00,249
but I need a bit more time.

1171
01:38:00,332 --> 01:38:03,627
I'll try my best to wrap this up quickly.

1172
01:38:04,169 --> 01:38:06,130
Please don't worry.

1173
01:38:09,216 --> 01:38:10,134
Hello?

1174
01:38:11,218 --> 01:38:13,387
<i>I'm disappointed in you.</i>

1175
01:38:14,179 --> 01:38:18,601
I think it's time
to conclude our partnership.

1176
01:38:19,977 --> 01:38:21,896
What do you mean?

1177
01:38:21,979 --> 01:38:24,106
My sincere gratitude

1178
01:38:25,190 --> 01:38:27,443
for all that you've done.

1179
01:39:00,434 --> 01:39:04,229
You turned Hong into a mole
that quickly?

1180
01:39:04,313 --> 01:39:06,482
Just to kill me?

1181
01:39:09,443 --> 01:39:12,613
Four years ago, the fire in Hong Kong,

1182
01:39:14,031 --> 01:39:15,491
that was also you, wasn't it?

1183
01:39:16,867 --> 01:39:18,994
What are you talking about?

1184
01:39:24,208 --> 01:39:25,793
I didn't have a choice.

1185
01:39:26,418 --> 01:39:29,129
Yeah, sure. None of those moles
had a choice, did they?

1186
01:39:32,007 --> 01:39:33,008
Where's Ozawa now?

1187
01:39:34,635 --> 01:39:37,471
Fu… Fukuyama Chemicals.

1188
01:39:37,554 --> 01:39:39,932
He's headed to their Chinese factory.

1189
01:39:40,474 --> 01:39:41,725
Why there?

1190
01:39:42,476 --> 01:39:44,061
I have no idea.

1191
01:39:44,853 --> 01:39:47,231
It's true!

1192
01:39:49,858 --> 01:39:50,859
Listen to me.

1193
01:39:52,069 --> 01:39:53,570
I can help you take him down.

1194
01:39:56,991 --> 01:39:58,117
Think about it.

1195
01:39:59,702 --> 01:40:03,539
Who else but me
could possibly pull that off?

1196
01:40:05,207 --> 01:40:08,544
Who's going to listen
to a hoodlum like you?

1197
01:40:10,963 --> 01:40:12,423
You're finished, too.

1198
01:40:22,224 --> 01:40:23,308
Sir.

1199
01:40:26,812 --> 01:40:28,897
-<i>It's me.</i>
-What?

1200
01:40:28,981 --> 01:40:30,441
Han came by earlier.

1201
01:40:30,524 --> 01:40:31,859
Well, where is he now?

1202
01:40:31,942 --> 01:40:35,237
Don't know.
He wanted me to tell you something.

1203
01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:37,448
<i>He wants to meet with you.</i>

1204
01:40:52,629 --> 01:40:55,674
Are you really actually alone?
The team isn't hiding nearby, right?

1205
01:40:55,758 --> 01:40:57,342
What are you so scared of?

1206
01:40:57,426 --> 01:40:59,428
There's no one I can trust anymore.

1207
01:40:59,511 --> 01:41:00,846
Where's Moon Ju-yeon?

1208
01:41:09,813 --> 01:41:10,814
What's your plan?

1209
01:41:10,898 --> 01:41:13,942
First, we all need to leave the city.

1210
01:41:14,026 --> 01:41:15,277
And get that list.

1211
01:41:15,944 --> 01:41:16,904
Come on.

1212
01:41:17,780 --> 01:41:20,199
If you hang around here,
you'll end up in prison.

1213
01:41:22,201 --> 01:41:23,494
Hey, Yaksha.

1214
01:41:26,789 --> 01:41:28,749
<i>Go and kill Yaksha.</i>

1215
01:41:29,291 --> 01:41:31,502
<i>Then bring Moon Ju-yeon to me.</i>

1216
01:41:32,002 --> 01:41:37,758
I hear your mom and sister run
a restaurant near Suwon City Hall?

1217
01:41:40,052 --> 01:41:41,762
If you don’t do as told,

1218
01:41:41,845 --> 01:41:43,889
after midnight,

1219
01:41:44,681 --> 01:41:47,309
a one-kilometer ring of fire will burn

1220
01:41:48,310 --> 01:41:50,020
around Suwon City Hall.

1221
01:42:08,789 --> 01:42:09,706
Get in.

1222
01:42:15,129 --> 01:42:16,380
Get in for now.

1223
01:42:44,491 --> 01:42:47,494
TO THE FUTURE
WITH REVOLUTIONARY TECHNOLOGY

1224
01:43:11,768 --> 01:43:14,938
I knew you could do it.
Very impressive.

1225
01:43:15,814 --> 01:43:19,151
Now, we've become friends.

1226
01:43:23,530 --> 01:43:24,740
You aren't hurt?

1227
01:43:25,824 --> 01:43:27,284
Sorry for the mess.

1228
01:43:27,784 --> 01:43:31,663
It wasn't easy finding a system
we can use for this job.

1229
01:43:32,873 --> 01:43:34,041
So,

1230
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:37,586
shall we begin?

1231
01:43:39,963 --> 01:43:42,257
This was the first intel

1232
01:43:42,341 --> 01:43:44,593
that Han gave us.

1233
01:43:49,223 --> 01:43:51,391
I need to leave the country by morning,

1234
01:43:52,434 --> 01:43:54,228
so we don't have time.

1235
01:44:07,574 --> 01:44:09,368
Hey, who are you?

1236
01:44:15,582 --> 01:44:17,542
Emergency in Zone A!

1237
01:44:17,626 --> 01:44:19,962
Zone A!

1238
01:44:20,045 --> 01:44:23,048
There's an intruder! Send security!

1239
01:44:23,131 --> 01:44:24,091
Hurry!

1240
01:44:24,841 --> 01:44:26,301
There he is.

1241
01:44:28,637 --> 01:44:29,763
Freeze!

1242
01:44:32,266 --> 01:44:33,225
Hands up!

1243
01:45:23,734 --> 01:45:24,901
Stop!

1244
01:45:29,364 --> 01:45:30,991
She went down!

1245
01:45:50,927 --> 01:45:51,928
Up there!

1246
01:46:21,124 --> 01:46:22,459
Why so slow?

1247
01:46:26,296 --> 01:46:28,548
You think
breaking and entering is so easy?

1248
01:46:31,051 --> 01:46:32,719
Don't try any tricks.

1249
01:46:52,489 --> 01:46:53,615
How is it going?

1250
01:46:53,698 --> 01:46:55,200
You're alive.

1251
01:46:55,283 --> 01:46:58,745
Sure. I don't die so easily.

1252
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:07,254
<i>He said he was going to shoot you,</i>
<i>but you should trust him.</i>

1253
01:47:09,214 --> 01:47:11,383
Have you ever seen me wear one of those?

1254
01:47:13,510 --> 01:47:17,305
If your number's up,
you die. If not, you live.

1255
01:47:17,389 --> 01:47:19,266
<i>That's what</i>
<i>he wanted me to tell you.</i>

1256
01:47:23,895 --> 01:47:24,896
Uh, that hurts.

1257
01:47:25,730 --> 01:47:27,441
Did any bullets pierce through?

1258
01:47:28,775 --> 01:47:29,776
Let me see.

1259
01:47:31,611 --> 01:47:34,906
Goddamn it.
How many times did he shoot me?

1260
01:47:36,992 --> 01:47:38,493
Prosecutor Han.

1261
01:47:39,911 --> 01:47:41,455
You deceived me?

1262
01:47:41,538 --> 01:47:44,791
Compared to your methods,
this is pretty tame.

1263
01:47:46,251 --> 01:47:49,254
After all the stunts you've pulled,

1264
01:47:49,838 --> 01:47:51,715
we decided to try one, too.

1265
01:47:52,674 --> 01:47:53,592
So what?

1266
01:47:57,888 --> 01:47:59,264
It's done.

1267
01:47:59,347 --> 01:48:00,432
Do it.

1268
01:48:16,865 --> 01:48:17,949
Huh.

1269
01:48:29,878 --> 01:48:32,506
Look at all those moles.
They're everywhere.

1270
01:48:34,090 --> 01:48:36,218
Are these all your trainees?

1271
01:48:37,135 --> 01:48:40,138
I like to think of them as my artworks.

1272
01:48:40,222 --> 01:48:41,389
My ass, they are.

1273
01:48:42,265 --> 01:48:44,226
Hey. Delete everything.

1274
01:48:55,820 --> 01:48:57,239
It's a shame,

1275
01:48:58,114 --> 01:49:00,158
but that's all I can show you today.

1276
01:49:08,667 --> 01:49:11,503
<i>Control room, respond!</i>
<i>The exit in Zone C has collapsed!</i>

1277
01:49:11,586 --> 01:49:13,838
<i>Open the exit in Zone D!</i>

1278
01:49:15,340 --> 01:49:17,133
<i>Control room, respond!</i>

1279
01:49:17,217 --> 01:49:19,970
You want to delete it? It's not up to you.

1280
01:49:22,556 --> 01:49:24,933
-You two, get out.
-Let's go together.

1281
01:49:25,016 --> 01:49:26,017
It's dangerous here.

1282
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:28,895
Go.

1283
01:49:30,230 --> 01:49:32,357
I'm going to skin this jerk alive.

1284
01:49:58,466 --> 01:49:59,509
Hey.

1285
01:50:30,165 --> 01:50:31,166
Stop!

1286
01:51:02,572 --> 01:51:05,825
-Where's he?
-He's still in there. With Ozawa.

1287
01:51:12,999 --> 01:51:15,710
The thought
of that list getting out,

1288
01:51:16,294 --> 01:51:17,962
does it make you tremble?

1289
01:51:24,969 --> 01:51:26,012
-No.
-Get off!

1290
01:51:26,096 --> 01:51:28,723
-We'll all die if we go in.
-We don't have time.

1291
01:51:28,807 --> 01:51:30,100
Listen to me!

1292
01:51:32,394 --> 01:51:34,062
-These are his orders!
-Wait! No!

1293
01:51:34,145 --> 01:51:35,438
Let go!

1294
01:51:38,108 --> 01:51:39,025
Shit.

1295
01:52:30,076 --> 01:52:32,078
Your mission has finished.

1296
01:52:33,163 --> 01:52:35,331
You can go now, Yaksha.

1297
01:52:41,254 --> 01:52:42,297
Drop the gun!

1298
01:52:43,757 --> 01:52:44,924
Prosecutor Han.

1299
01:52:45,008 --> 01:52:48,178
You keep disappointing me.

1300
01:52:48,261 --> 01:52:49,387
Do it.

1301
01:52:50,930 --> 01:52:52,348
That's right.

1302
01:52:52,432 --> 01:52:53,725
Shoot.

1303
01:52:54,726 --> 01:52:58,938
Shall we bet on who's faster?

1304
01:53:00,648 --> 01:53:01,900
One.

1305
01:53:02,525 --> 01:53:03,526
Two.

1306
01:53:45,860 --> 01:53:46,903
What's going on?

1307
01:53:47,403 --> 01:53:51,115
If anyone attempts to delete the file,

1308
01:53:51,199 --> 01:53:53,785
it's programmed to send it out.

1309
01:53:55,411 --> 01:53:57,956
The intelligence services

1310
01:53:58,039 --> 01:54:00,625
of each country where your moles work

1311
01:54:00,708 --> 01:54:02,544
are receiving the list right now.

1312
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:11,135
No! Damn it!

1313
01:54:26,401 --> 01:54:27,777
Damn it!

1314
01:55:52,862 --> 01:55:54,405
You're the one who's finished.

1315
01:56:49,794 --> 01:56:53,339
<i>Hey, Nike.</i>
<i>Pull it together and listen carefully.</i>

1316
01:56:53,923 --> 01:56:56,175
Whether you have to crawl away or jump,

1317
01:56:56,843 --> 01:57:00,054
make it out of here alive. You understand?

1318
01:57:02,140 --> 01:57:04,225
Then go to the old man's liquor factory.

1319
01:57:06,936 --> 01:57:08,021
Take that thing in,

1320
01:57:09,147 --> 01:57:13,317
prosecute her to the full extent
of the law like you said.

1321
01:57:14,027 --> 01:57:15,153
What do you mean?

1322
01:57:15,236 --> 01:57:18,740
You clean things up. You do it.

1323
01:57:20,199 --> 01:57:21,743
You're the only one I trust.

1324
01:57:23,703 --> 01:57:24,829
Now, go.

1325
01:57:56,027 --> 01:57:58,988

Chairman Lee!
Do you finally admit to the crimes?

1340

A pleasure, sir.

1341
01:58:44,242 --> 01:58:47,411
I think you spilled sauce

That impregnable fortress

01:59:35,168 --> 01:59:37,920
collapsed after
just a few short confessions.

1354
01:59:38,004 --> 01:59:39,130
Hi, there.

1355
01:59:39,839 --> 01:59:40,882
What can I say?

1356
01:59:41,674 --> 01:59:44,218
It's like you waited for him
to turn around

1357
01:59:44,302 --> 01:59:46,345
then hit him in the back of his head.

1358
01:59:46,429 --> 01:59:48,472
That's not your style at all.

1359
01:59:49,640 --> 01:59:51,309
You've changed, haven't you?

1360
01:59:53,811 --> 01:59:54,687
Someone told me.

1361
01:59:55,646 --> 01:59:58,482
Justice has ot be preserved

Hello?

<i>Is this Prosecutor Han Ji-hoon?</i>

1365
02:00:09,076 --> 02:00:11,871
Yes, it is. Who's speaking?

1366
02:00:13,915 --> 02:00:14,999
<i> Hey, Nike!</i>

1367
02:00:16,959 --> 02:00:18,044
It's me, Yaksha.

1368
02:00:18,127 --> 02:00:19,170
What happened?

1369
02:00:20,379 --> 02:00:21,797
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1370
02:00:21,881 --> 02:00:23,466
<i>Did you think I was dead?</i>

<i>It'll take more than that.</i>

1372
02:00:26,636 --> 02:00:27,553
Where are you now?

1373
02:00:27,637 --> 02:00:30,223
Where do you think?
Back on the battlefield.

1374

<i>I need you here now.</i>

1375

Dragging me back into the sewer?

1379
02:00:45,947 --> 02:00:48,241
Looks like it's pretty filthy this time.

1380
02:00:48,324 --> 02:00:49,825
Keep your phone on, all right?

1381
02:01:27,822 --> 02:01:29,699
Please follow me, everyone.

1382
02:01:30,700 --> 02:01:31,701
This way.

1383
02:01:31,784 --> 02:01:33,202
Go on inside.

1384
02:01:53,389 --> 02:01:54,515
Oy!

1385
02:01:54,598 --> 02:01:56,183
Hey, you bloody idiot!

1386
02:01:56,267 --> 02:01:58,644
Quit slacking off, and get back to work!
