1
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,367
Everybody said...

2
00:00:38,368 --> 00:00:40,420
that the tree was rotting.

3
00:00:42,285 --> 00:00:43,950
But I told them...

4
00:00:43,951 --> 00:00:46,720
which was far from it.

5
00:00:47,868 --> 00:00:51,135
That night I had a dream.

6
00:00:52,535 --> 00:00:54,242
In dream...

7
00:00:54,243 --> 00:01:01,425
I saw the tree growing strong towards the blue sky.

8
00:01:03,743 --> 00:01:08,594
I gathered everyone together and told them that the tree was not rotting.

9
00:01:11,576 --> 00:01:15,336
It was not a rotten tree.

10
00:01:27,951 --> 00:01:29,534
All units, jump!

11
00:01:29,535 --> 00:01:31,535
Jump, jump!

12
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,160
jump!

13
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:50,576
"Capitán Kwon".

14
00:01:59,535 --> 00:02:01,400
Take cover! Disconnect enemy communications!

15
00:02:01,401 --> 00:02:03,401
Received!

16
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,660
"Apoyo".

17
00:02:06,035 --> 00:02:07,242
Complete disconnection.

18
00:02:07,243 --> 00:02:08,950
"Recognition".

19
00:02:08,951 --> 00:02:11,754
Right in the chest, take it already!

20
00:02:11,785 --> 00:02:13,785
"Demolition".

21
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,160
"Negative space".

22
00:02:21,535 --> 00:02:22,617
Clear sector.

23
00:02:22,618 --> 00:02:24,618
"Yong_guru".

24
00:02:26,451 --> 00:02:28,200
Captain! Captain!

25
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:29,284
Hey Mr. Hairy...

26
00:02:29,285 --> 00:02:31,383
If you follow the captain, he will be exposed.

27
00:02:51,451 --> 00:02:53,753
Captain, I've got the building scanned.

28
00:02:54,201 --> 00:02:55,534
Look at all those enemies.

29
00:02:55,535 --> 00:02:57,492
How do we disarm the bomb inside?

30
00:02:57,493 --> 00:03:00,992
I will go ahead, the rest go behind.

31
00:03:00,993 --> 00:03:03,450
What did you say? Will you get ahead?

32
00:03:03,451 --> 00:03:05,451
Captain! Captain!

33
00:03:08,285 --> 00:03:10,383
Enemies! Enemies!

34
00:03:38,826 --> 00:03:40,826
Mr. Hairy, stay here.

35
00:03:47,993 --> 00:03:50,842
- Captain, we're in! - Here!

36
00:04:20,368 --> 00:04:21,867
- Fall back! - Report!

37
00:04:21,868 --> 00:04:23,868
Captain, it's a trap!

38
00:04:24,493 --> 00:04:25,867
- Can you hold position? - It doesn't look good.

39
00:04:25,868 --> 00:04:28,512
Captain, can you disarm the bomb?

40
00:04:29,076 --> 00:04:31,076
Leave it to me.

41
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,493
I'm almost there, just a little more.

42
00:04:56,618 --> 00:04:57,700
Mr. S.S. Hairy!

43
00:04:57,701 --> 00:04:59,200
I dont believe it!

44
00:04:59,201 --> 00:05:00,299
I'm coming in, cover me!

45
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,284
Hold position!

46
00:05:01,285 --> 00:05:03,285
Don't move, stay there!

47
00:05:05,035 --> 00:05:08,259
Captain, I sent the bomb plans, take them as soon as possible.

48
00:05:08,535 --> 00:05:09,909
Captain!

49
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,304
If you don't hurry, we'll be in danger! Fast!

50
00:05:15,826 --> 00:05:19,630
Captain! Hairy is a lost cause, give it up this time!

51
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,450
Get Mr. Hairy Out!

52
00:05:41,451 --> 00:05:44,174
Yong_guru, Demolition, go defuse the bomb!

53
00:05:45,076 --> 00:05:45,724
Received!

54
00:05:45,725 --> 00:05:46,742
Received!

55
00:05:46,743 --> 00:05:48,659
He's crazy, seriously.

56
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,660
That is why he is our leader.

57
00:05:54,951 --> 00:05:56,742
Captain, we are here!

58
00:05:56,743 --> 00:05:58,743
Ok, in a hurry.

59
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,008
Captain, captain!

60
00:06:18,576 --> 00:06:20,909
- Captain! - Yong_guru, hurry up, hurry up!

61
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:24,293
A little more, come on, hold on a little more.

62
00:06:40,826 --> 00:06:43,128
Captain!

63
00:06:54,951 --> 00:06:56,951
"Captain Kwon, killed in action."

64
00:07:00,118 --> 00:07:02,295
Complete deactivation.

65
00:07:04,285 --> 00:07:06,633
"Round won."

66
00:07:14,451 --> 00:07:16,242
We won without you.

67
00:07:16,243 --> 00:07:18,243
It's all Mr. Hairy's fault.

68
00:07:18,243 --> 00:07:20,243
Shouldn't he get into another game?

69
00:07:20,326 --> 00:07:22,469
- I'm sorry. - As long as we win...

70
00:07:22,868 --> 00:07:26,034
Captain, you are such an idiot.

71
00:07:26,035 --> 00:07:29,867
He knows it's bullshit and he calls himself captain.

72
00:07:29,868 --> 00:07:32,159
Who cares. They always kill me.

73
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,159
Because you always try to save others.

74
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,992
Who are you to talk, Hairy.

75
00:07:36,993 --> 00:07:40,075
Okay, since we won, let's meet for dinner.

76
00:07:40,076 --> 00:07:41,534
30,000 each!

77
00:07:41,535 --> 00:07:43,758
Captain, come tonight!

78
00:07:43,785 --> 00:07:45,742
Being mysterious is overrated.

79
00:07:45,743 --> 00:07:48,492
Let's take a look at you.

80
00:07:48,493 --> 00:07:50,034
How about grilled intestines?

81
00:07:50,035 --> 00:07:51,992
Deal! BBQ with the captain!

82
00:07:51,993 --> 00:07:55,325
I'm very busy these days...

83
00:07:55,326 --> 00:07:57,117
- Come on! - Another time, perhaps.

84
00:07:57,118 --> 00:07:58,784
- "Miss Lee." - I do not want to see you.

85
00:07:58,785 --> 00:08:00,534
What do you do exactly?

86
00:08:00,535 --> 00:08:02,803
I am receiving many calls.

87
00:08:03,076 --> 00:08:05,076
- I disconnect. - That? No!

88
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,075
That?

89
00:08:06,076 --> 00:08:09,325
Where are you? At the internet cafe again? Because...?

90
00:08:09,326 --> 00:08:11,326
You're a child?

91
00:08:11,326 --> 00:08:13,284
Always with video games.

92
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:15,285
Why do you call me?

93
00:08:15,535 --> 00:08:17,409
I left the gas valve on.

94
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,145
Go close it.

95
00:08:18,146 --> 00:08:21,242
Did you call me for that? The gas valve?

96
00:08:21,243 --> 00:08:23,450
It could explode, go quickly.

97
00:08:23,451 --> 00:08:25,035
Why is it going to explode?!

98
00:08:25,036 --> 00:08:26,367
I'm busy.

99
00:08:26,368 --> 00:08:28,284
So proud of you, parasite.

100
00:08:28,285 --> 00:08:30,285
Oh really...

101
00:08:31,076 --> 00:08:33,659
I have a night shift at the hospital.

102
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,159
See if I ask you nicely.

103
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,659
I'm very busy!

104
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,758
- See you tomorrow. - Mother! Mother!

105
00:08:43,535 --> 00:08:45,325
Nice, right?

106
00:08:45,326 --> 00:08:49,051
My son bought it on a school trip.

107
00:08:49,451 --> 00:08:51,451
It's germanium.

108
00:08:51,701 --> 00:08:54,550
It seems that it is good for health.

109
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:09,359
"Team eliminated."

110
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:15,532
Hello?

111
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:16,909
Is it the internet cafe?

112
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,304
I left my phone there.

113
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,159
Could you bring it to me?

114
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,950
- Now I'm in... - Wait a minute.

115
00:09:22,951 --> 00:09:24,409
I am a very busy man.

116
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:27,088
I'll pay you 300,000.

117
00:09:27,951 --> 00:09:29,951
I do not believe this...

118
00:09:33,826 --> 00:09:36,220
Where are you?

119
00:09:55,451 --> 00:09:57,451
Hey?

120
00:09:59,785 --> 00:10:01,785
Is there someone?

121
00:10:05,618 --> 00:10:07,618
What's happening?

122
00:10:14,576 --> 00:10:16,576
Hey?

123
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:19,451
I brought your phone.

124
00:10:19,576 --> 00:10:23,050
Hello, I'm in the shower.

125
00:10:23,118 --> 00:10:25,242
You can leave it anywhere.

126
00:10:25,243 --> 00:10:28,034
You said you would pay me...

127
00:10:28,035 --> 00:10:30,212
It's upstairs, in my bed.

128
00:10:32,618 --> 00:10:34,618
Good.

129
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,053
I left your phone on the bed.

130
00:10:49,743 --> 00:10:54,423
Excuse me, you should close the door, it can be dangerous.

131
00:11:21,493 --> 00:11:23,795
Catch it! Grab it!

132
00:11:27,451 --> 00:11:29,451
Stay still, bastard!

133
00:11:29,493 --> 00:11:31,450
Be good, don't resist!

134
00:11:31,451 --> 00:11:35,335
You're under arrest for statutory rape and murder.

135
00:11:35,535 --> 00:11:36,825
According to the fifth...

136
00:11:36,826 --> 00:11:38,826
What's going on?

137
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,803
- Call forensics. - Yes sir.

138
00:11:49,326 --> 00:11:51,326
Don't move!

139
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,660
Show your face!

140
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:04,499
The rapist and murderer of...

141
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,234
"Murderous Rapist Arrested".

142
00:12:05,235 --> 00:12:06,367
A minor victim...

143
00:12:06,368 --> 00:12:08,368
He was arrested this morning...

144
00:12:08,576 --> 00:12:11,049
The signing of this check, is this yours?

145
00:12:11,701 --> 00:12:12,114
That's how it is.

146
00:12:12,115 --> 00:12:14,345
Yeah, but the thing is...

147
00:12:14,576 --> 00:12:17,284
What about your fingerprints all over the knife?

148
00:12:17,285 --> 00:12:18,992
That's what I do not understand...

149
00:12:18,993 --> 00:12:22,342
The prime suspect was a national taekwondo athlete...

150
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:25,054
Kwon participated in a violent game before the murder.

151
00:12:25,118 --> 00:12:25,861
He was fired after an assault case...

152
00:12:25,862 --> 00:12:27,909
and led a life of unemployment resorting to video games.

153
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,617
A national athlete?

154
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:30,394
What happens?

155
00:12:30,395 --> 00:12:31,617
Where is my son?

156
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:33,825
- You can't come here! - Let go! And my son?

157
00:12:33,826 --> 00:12:35,450
¡ Kwon Yu!

158
00:12:35,451 --> 00:12:37,950
The suspect denies all charges...

159
00:12:37,951 --> 00:12:39,450
While fingerprints and DNA...

160
00:12:39,451 --> 00:12:42,367
found at the crime scene...

161
00:12:42,368 --> 00:12:45,034
They were sent to coroners for analysis.

162
00:12:45,035 --> 00:12:47,035
On a handkerchief found at the scene...

163
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:50,535
your sperm was detected.

164
00:12:52,035 --> 00:12:53,534
My son is not a murderer.

165
00:12:53,535 --> 00:12:55,367
Please read this.

166
00:12:55,368 --> 00:12:56,950
Please...

167
00:12:56,951 --> 00:12:58,117
Please read it...

168
00:12:58,118 --> 00:13:00,170
My son was framed.

169
00:13:00,576 --> 00:13:03,004
Please read this, thank you.

170
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:07,546
He has no conscience, he is a monster.

171
00:13:11,243 --> 00:13:15,659
DNA found at the scene is from suspect Kwon Yu...

172
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,839
and the court is pressured to deliver justice.

173
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:20,659
Lawyer Min...

174
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,987
my son would never kill a person.

175
00:13:22,988 --> 00:13:24,742
Please watch this.

176
00:13:24,743 --> 00:13:26,200
You can leave the documents here.

177
00:13:26,201 --> 00:13:27,617
Please look at them.

178
00:13:27,618 --> 00:13:29,618
He won a medal.

179
00:13:29,618 --> 00:13:31,575
Lord, ever since I was a child...

180
00:13:31,576 --> 00:13:33,576
Yes, this is lawyer Min Chum-sang.

181
00:13:34,576 --> 00:13:38,676
Yes, I am a public defender, what can I do for you?

182
00:13:42,785 --> 00:13:44,785
Don't worry too much.

183
00:13:44,826 --> 00:13:47,800
Send us the documents and we will examine them.

184
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,534
Yes Yes.

185
00:13:49,535 --> 00:13:51,535
Thank you.

186
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:57,117
I brought him up even more strictly, because he had no father.

187
00:13:57,118 --> 00:13:59,118
The way I see it...

188
00:13:59,618 --> 00:14:01,618
ought...

189
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,159
ask your child to confess and admit it.

190
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,825
At least he'll get a mitigation.

191
00:14:05,826 --> 00:14:08,075
But Mr. Min, you haven't even heard...

192
00:14:08,076 --> 00:14:11,117
The evidence against him is numerous...

193
00:14:11,118 --> 00:14:13,492
so if he continues to deny it, it could be worse...

194
00:14:13,493 --> 00:14:14,700
Lady? Lady?

195
00:14:14,701 --> 00:14:16,659
We can talk?

196
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,825
Did the police tell you to come here?

197
00:14:18,826 --> 00:14:22,742
Mr. Min tries to help everyone who needs it.

198
00:14:22,743 --> 00:14:25,592
- If you go home and wait... - Mr. Min!

199
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,883
Please believe my son.

200
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:34,242
The defendant promptly left the crime scene after the murder...

201
00:14:34,243 --> 00:14:36,117
He only collected the reward...

202
00:14:36,118 --> 00:14:41,925
The prints on the knife and the doorknob match Kwon's.

203
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,784
After sexually assaulting the minor twice...

204
00:14:47,785 --> 00:14:51,492
Kwon stabbed her 31 times in the neck and abdomen...

205
00:14:51,493 --> 00:14:54,950
and took the body to the bathroom to clean it.

206
00:14:54,951 --> 00:14:56,202
Silence please.

207
00:14:56,203 --> 00:14:57,534
I really didn't.

208
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:02,825
When a game addict becomes obsessed, he does not distinguish between fact and fiction.

209
00:15:02,826 --> 00:15:07,909
That is why you can commit antisocial acts without remorse.

210
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,950
Death penalty or castration!

211
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:12,200
Just neuter him.

212
00:15:12,201 --> 00:15:15,784
"The councilman proposes the 'Kwon law'. The councilman presented a project...

213
00:15:15,785 --> 00:15:18,575
for a tougher sentence for rape.

214
00:15:18,576 --> 00:15:20,992
After being kicked out of the national team...

215
00:15:20,993 --> 00:15:25,594
Please understand that he suffered from severe depression.

216
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:31,492
Despite the clear evidence against him...

217
00:15:31,493 --> 00:15:36,409
the defendant Kwon Yu refuses to admit his wrongdoing.

218
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,410
Therefore...

219
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:44,137
The defendant is guilty of sexual assault on a minor...

220
00:15:44,368 --> 00:15:50,075
first-degree murder of a minor, and desecration of a corpse...

221
00:15:50,076 --> 00:15:51,992
and is sentenced as follows.

222
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:56,343
Life in prison without parole.

223
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:01,659
My son did not go!

224
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,075
It was not him!

225
00:16:03,076 --> 00:16:03,420
No!

226
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:06,242
I did not go! I know nothing!

227
00:16:06,243 --> 00:16:07,742
¡ Kwon Yu!

228
00:16:07,743 --> 00:16:09,700
I did not go! Mother!

229
00:16:09,701 --> 00:16:10,867
Mother! Mother!

230
00:16:10,868 --> 00:16:12,909
The identity of the defendant...

231
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:17,545
will be released to the public for ten years.

232
00:16:18,451 --> 00:16:21,575
As part of the rehabilitation...

233
00:16:21,576 --> 00:16:26,131
will receive five years of treatment for sexual drive.

234
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:30,260
Furthermore, given the violent nature of his crime...

235
00:16:30,618 --> 00:16:33,867
and as it requires isolation from society...

236
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:38,344
He will serve his sentence in a maximum security prison.

237
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:44,492
- Wait! Please! - Salt!

238
00:16:44,493 --> 00:16:46,950
Get out, bastard!

239
00:16:46,951 --> 00:16:49,925
Wait! I did not go!

240
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:23,575
Come here! Come here!

241
00:18:23,576 --> 00:18:25,576
Come here, move away!

242
00:18:50,201 --> 00:18:52,201
You came for this.

243
00:18:52,285 --> 00:18:54,285
Rape.

244
00:18:54,326 --> 00:18:55,867
Rape a little girl. Bastard.

245
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,575
Was not me.

246
00:18:57,576 --> 00:18:59,576
Motherfucker!

247
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,087
How dare you answer!

248
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,660
Motherfucker!

249
00:19:07,368 --> 00:19:10,046
Look around you, see them.

250
00:19:11,368 --> 00:19:14,117
They are all proud of their crimes. "I committed murder!"

251
00:19:14,118 --> 00:19:15,742
"I hit him until he stopped breathing!"

252
00:19:15,743 --> 00:19:17,992
"It pisses me off that I didn't kill him!"

253
00:19:17,993 --> 00:19:19,575
Look at this moron.

254
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:21,117
You are denying everything.

255
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,671
"It wasn't me, I didn't do it!"

256
00:19:24,535 --> 00:19:26,020
"They are wrong! It was spoiled!".

257
00:19:26,021 --> 00:19:27,784
"It was love! We loved each other!"

258
00:19:27,785 --> 00:19:29,785
Fuck!

259
00:19:30,326 --> 00:19:32,326
Come here, bastard!

260
00:19:33,743 --> 00:19:35,743
Boss! Boss!

261
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:38,617
Let go!

262
00:19:38,618 --> 00:19:40,284
Motherfucker!

263
00:19:40,285 --> 00:19:42,383
Aside!

264
00:19:47,743 --> 00:19:49,325
Back off!

265
00:19:49,326 --> 00:19:52,300
You're crazy?!

266
00:19:52,451 --> 00:19:55,345
When an adult speaks, you say, "Yes, I understand, sir!"

267
00:19:55,743 --> 00:19:58,967
They are elementary manners. Don't throw it to the ground!

268
00:19:59,035 --> 00:20:01,429
How dare you hit me, you bastard?!

269
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,659
My hand!

270
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,159
You are dead.

271
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,233
Damn!

272
00:20:06,234 --> 00:20:07,992
Back off!

273
00:20:07,993 --> 00:20:09,367
Ma Duk-su.

274
00:20:09,368 --> 00:20:11,284
I was hit, I am the victim.

275
00:20:11,285 --> 00:20:12,009
He hit me first.

276
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,992
They are all witnesses.

277
00:20:13,993 --> 00:20:15,993
Look, blood in the nose.

278
00:20:20,493 --> 00:20:22,493
take it away

279
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,713
Kwon Yu, 30 days of isolation.

280
00:21:00,785 --> 00:21:02,785
Asshole, I heard you hit Ma.

281
00:21:04,035 --> 00:21:05,742
It's alright, it's alright.

282
00:21:05,743 --> 00:21:08,762
We are not with them, we are on your side.

283
00:21:08,826 --> 00:21:11,800
To be in perpetual life, how could you attack him?

284
00:21:12,493 --> 00:21:15,200
You have to like him.

285
00:21:15,201 --> 00:21:16,450
Like me.

286
00:21:16,451 --> 00:21:18,451
And he, look at him.

287
00:21:18,785 --> 00:21:20,284
He's a serial killer.

288
00:21:20,285 --> 00:21:23,034
It ate the person it killed.

289
00:21:23,035 --> 00:21:25,554
Be careful with him and Ma Duk-su.

290
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:29,210
Anyway, give us details.

291
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,660
How old was she?

292
00:21:35,118 --> 00:21:36,617
Middle School?

293
00:21:36,618 --> 00:21:38,618
Institute?

294
00:21:39,118 --> 00:21:41,386
School uniform or street clothes? Tell us!

295
00:21:41,493 --> 00:21:44,216
We have to be together, you could just die!

296
00:21:56,743 --> 00:21:58,743
Unfortunate!

297
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:01,451
¡Agárrenlo!

298
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:12,285
I really hate...

299
00:22:13,951 --> 00:22:16,504
to those who do not regret.

300
00:22:16,618 --> 00:22:20,950
If you commit a crime, you must repent and start over.

301
00:22:20,951 --> 00:22:23,970
Starting a fight, acting out and all that shit.

302
00:22:25,618 --> 00:22:28,367
After today, I want to see you repentant and remorseful.

303
00:22:28,368 --> 00:22:31,217
"Please don't kill me."

304
00:22:35,535 --> 00:22:37,712
Come on, get it ready.

305
00:22:43,826 --> 00:22:45,284
Do it.

306
00:22:45,285 --> 00:22:47,285
What you did to the little girl.

307
00:22:47,326 --> 00:22:49,326
Are you crazy?

308
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:52,450
And you? They can do it?

309
00:22:52,451 --> 00:22:54,674
That? Yeah! Yeah!

310
00:22:54,785 --> 00:22:57,588
I will do it! I will strive!

311
00:22:58,118 --> 00:22:58,719
Forward.

312
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,922
Get off me, you fucking charlatans!

313
00:23:03,535 --> 00:23:07,825
"Please find out the truth."

314
00:23:07,826 --> 00:23:12,381
"My son is not a murderer!"

315
00:23:14,076 --> 00:23:16,076
Bastard!

316
00:23:16,535 --> 00:23:18,535
¡Agárrenlo!

317
00:23:18,826 --> 00:23:22,881
- Quiet, dammit! - Do not move!

318
00:24:02,118 --> 00:24:04,118
It's tough, isn't it?

319
00:24:07,576 --> 00:24:09,576
I did...

320
00:24:10,326 --> 00:24:12,799
a protest in front of the court...

321
00:24:13,993 --> 00:24:17,342
and gave an interview to a new magazine...

322
00:24:17,826 --> 00:24:20,925
and thanks to that...

323
00:24:22,035 --> 00:24:25,885
I got in touch with someone who knows your alibi.

324
00:24:27,118 --> 00:24:32,049
I'll see you next week, and I'll start the appeal process.

325
00:24:35,785 --> 00:24:37,785
Kwon Yu...

326
00:24:49,493 --> 00:24:51,493
I...

327
00:24:52,785 --> 00:24:55,588
I don't want to be the mother of a rapist.

328
00:24:57,118 --> 00:24:59,512
If you don't want to be a rapist...

329
00:25:00,368 --> 00:25:02,466
be strong and hold on.

330
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:12,297
I'm going to get you out of here.

331
00:25:32,701 --> 00:25:34,659
Sight.

332
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,962
He found a way to live.

333
00:25:37,368 --> 00:25:39,368
Then I better help.

334
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,087
Rub it on your wounds.

335
00:26:24,493 --> 00:26:26,887
You must have been an athlete.

336
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:30,342
You protect your pressure points even during beatings.

337
00:26:50,993 --> 00:26:53,136
I've been watching you.

338
00:26:53,243 --> 00:26:55,466
You are not a murderer.

339
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:03,465
I'm sure Ma knows you're not a murderous rapist.

340
00:27:07,618 --> 00:27:11,172
You just messed with his ego.

341
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,493
Ma has fallen!

342
00:29:11,243 --> 00:29:13,386
Kwon Yu, you have visitors.

343
00:29:28,785 --> 00:29:30,785
Did he come alone?

344
00:29:31,493 --> 00:29:33,493
and mom?

345
00:29:40,785 --> 00:29:43,008
"Death certificate: Lee yeon-ok."

346
00:29:43,951 --> 00:29:45,951
What is this?

347
00:29:52,493 --> 00:29:55,171
He had a difficult time...

348
00:29:56,785 --> 00:29:59,200
But I didn't think it would go this far...

349
00:29:59,201 --> 00:30:01,720
What is he saying?

350
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:03,409
Why should he?

351
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:05,410
He said he'd get me...

352
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,160
to stay strong...

353
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:13,043
Why would he do this all of a sudden?

354
00:30:13,118 --> 00:30:16,501
You must sign to do the funeral.

355
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:23,262
The district office will arrange the funeral.

356
00:30:23,743 --> 00:30:29,263
But you won't be able to attend.

357
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:35,136
I tried to get you to attend, but the application was rejected.

358
00:31:45,743 --> 00:31:47,743
Mother!

359
00:31:50,243 --> 00:31:52,243
Mother...

360
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:08,910
Mother!

361
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:57,410
Do not resist!

362
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:33,920
Kwon Yu! Loosen the razor!

363
00:34:06,993 --> 00:34:12,254
If an artery, a muscle, or an organ is damaged, you're screwed.

364
00:34:12,451 --> 00:34:15,550
Don't stab too deep, go for the waist, okay?

365
00:34:19,035 --> 00:34:21,035
Do you have a plan when you go out?

366
00:34:22,826 --> 00:34:24,826
I'm going to clear my name.

367
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:28,213
I promised my mother...

368
00:34:28,493 --> 00:34:30,493
that he would not be a rapist.

369
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:44,410
Give me the key.

370
00:36:28,118 --> 00:36:31,659
Rapist-murderer Kwon Yu escaped from prison yesterday.

371
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:34,163
When the police arrived on the scene...

372
00:36:34,164 --> 00:36:36,409
Kwon Yu was untraceable...

373
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:40,534
and they sent a communiqué to all points of the nation.

374
00:36:40,535 --> 00:36:42,825
Kwon's current whereabouts are unknown...

375
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:46,784
and his uniform was recovered in a fishing area.

376
00:36:46,785 --> 00:36:51,742
The police found blood on his uniform and it is presumed that he is injured...

377
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:55,047
so it can't have gotten far.

378
00:36:55,076 --> 00:36:57,076
They are reinforcing...

379
00:36:57,076 --> 00:36:59,076
checkpoints at bus terminals...

380
00:36:59,076 --> 00:37:04,587
searching the nearby mountains, and blocking the main roads.

381
00:37:29,118 --> 00:37:31,341
You are a handyman!

382
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:33,678
Incredible!

383
00:37:33,743 --> 00:37:36,617
If it wasn't for you, we would have had to cancel the whole vacation.

384
00:37:36,618 --> 00:37:37,784
Our heroe.

385
00:37:37,785 --> 00:37:40,008
We are going to Cheongju airport. How do you say?

386
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:46,176
- Cheongju Airport. - Yes, Cheongju airport.

387
00:37:46,285 --> 00:37:49,700
We are going to Hangzhou, China.

388
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:51,701
Yes, in China. Yes Yes Yes.

389
00:37:51,743 --> 00:37:54,045
Tour!

390
00:37:54,368 --> 00:37:56,368
So happy!

391
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:02,075
What is this?

392
00:38:02,076 --> 00:38:04,076
A road block.

393
00:38:17,618 --> 00:38:18,615
It's a checkpoint...

394
00:38:18,616 --> 00:38:20,492
What's going on? We don't have all day.

395
00:38:20,493 --> 00:38:22,450
Wait wait wait. I know, I know.

396
00:38:22,451 --> 00:38:23,497
Listen, we really have to go.

397
00:38:23,498 --> 00:38:25,409
We have to take a plane.

398
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:28,259
- And if you let me talk to the officer? - Come in.

399
00:38:28,326 --> 00:38:30,970
- Come in! - Thanks thanks.

400
00:38:31,285 --> 00:38:32,575
Thanks thanks.

401
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:35,299
No trace on the roads towards the city.

402
00:38:51,118 --> 00:38:54,137
We bought it for 200,000 won when we arrived in Korea...

403
00:38:54,243 --> 00:38:56,343
now you can scrap it for...

404
00:38:56,344 --> 00:38:57,784
How do you say 40?

405
00:38:57,785 --> 00:38:59,785
400.000 won.

406
00:38:59,826 --> 00:39:01,826
Shit car, shit car.

407
00:39:02,201 --> 00:39:04,075
Thank you.

408
00:39:04,076 --> 00:39:06,076
Thank you.

409
00:39:22,201 --> 00:39:24,992
Two days have passed since the pursuit of the fugitive Kwon...

410
00:39:24,993 --> 00:39:27,825
and is expected to continue for some time.

411
00:39:27,826 --> 00:39:30,825
People have expressed concern...

412
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:34,300
for more rapes and murders with Kwon on the run.

413
00:39:45,285 --> 00:39:48,384
I totally forgot to bring the painting.

414
00:39:48,993 --> 00:39:51,421
My memory is not what it was.

415
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,660
President Chu Sang-duk?

416
00:39:54,243 --> 00:39:56,420
President Ch...

417
00:39:59,076 --> 00:40:01,253
Oh, from the Hyosin Group?

418
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:09,921
I'll call him back when I go over the scene tomorrow.

419
00:40:22,285 --> 00:40:23,273
My picture...

420
00:40:23,274 --> 00:40:27,841
I'm a wanted man, so I had nowhere to go.

421
00:40:28,035 --> 00:40:30,929
I sneaked in without permission, sorry.

422
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:53,669
When he came to visit with my mother...

423
00:40:54,451 --> 00:40:56,409
she mentioned...

424
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:58,200
to a person who knows my alibi...

425
00:40:58,201 --> 00:40:59,659
- Alibi? - Yeah.

426
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,867
Did you meet with that person?

427
00:41:01,868 --> 00:41:04,284
You didn't run away to see it, did you?

428
00:41:04,285 --> 00:41:09,136
I don't know who it is, but I need to see it.

429
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:14,714
It's weird that mom killed herself while preparing my appeal.

430
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,409
I have to see it and...

431
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:22,465
It was false information, a prank call from some children.

432
00:41:24,535 --> 00:41:27,463
He took it very badly.

433
00:41:28,368 --> 00:41:31,171
I certainly couldn't look at you again.

434
00:41:32,868 --> 00:41:35,075
cried for days...

435
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:37,253
and chose his destiny.

436
00:41:40,493 --> 00:41:43,876
This belonged to him. You recognize it?

437
00:41:51,868 --> 00:41:53,784
Call the police.

438
00:41:53,785 --> 00:41:57,168
I'll investigate your case later, turn yourself in.

439
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,784
Kwon Yu, high!

440
00:42:02,785 --> 00:42:04,785
Not here.

441
00:42:07,035 --> 00:42:09,035
"Kwon Yu".

442
00:42:10,743 --> 00:42:12,743
"The fugitive Kwon Yu on the loose."

443
00:42:32,543 --> 00:42:33,742
"Police Recover Kwon Yu's Prison Uniform in a Fishing Area".

444
00:42:33,743 --> 00:42:35,743
"Is Kwon Yu the real killer?"

445
00:42:39,826 --> 00:42:44,534
Rapist and murderer of a minor, the video game addict Kwon Yu...

446
00:42:44,535 --> 00:42:45,742
Does Mr. Hairy?

447
00:42:45,743 --> 00:42:50,423
There are many discrepancies in the investigation of your case.

448
00:42:50,451 --> 00:42:54,200
The CCTV evidence presented by the prosecution...

449
00:42:54,201 --> 00:42:59,378
They only have pictures of Kwon, and nothing before or after.

450
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:02,463
The prosecution said it was a recording malfunction.

451
00:43:02,785 --> 00:43:07,325
They also didn't know about a car camera...

452
00:43:07,326 --> 00:43:09,594
where Kwon appears.

453
00:43:10,076 --> 00:43:13,534
For that reason the owner of the car wanted to use that recording...

454
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:16,159
and sent it to a media outlet.

455
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:20,200
But for unknown reasons, the recording was lost...

456
00:43:20,201 --> 00:43:23,175
and almost buried in the station's server.

457
00:43:23,326 --> 00:43:27,284
A new hacker was hacking the station's servers...

458
00:43:27,285 --> 00:43:29,428
and found it by chance.

459
00:43:29,701 --> 00:43:32,754
Contrary to the prosecution's arguments...

460
00:43:32,993 --> 00:43:35,242
Kwon was seen going in and out of the motel...

461
00:43:35,243 --> 00:43:38,117
in 3 minutes and 16 seconds exactly.

462
00:43:38,118 --> 00:43:43,254
Is it logically possible to have sex twice, stab her...

463
00:43:43,285 --> 00:43:47,089
then take the corpse to the bathroom...

464
00:43:47,576 --> 00:43:49,492
and clean it of all traces?

465
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:53,718
To investigate Ha Ji-su's whereabouts before her death...

466
00:43:53,826 --> 00:43:57,005
We reviewed their Facebook and Instagram pages...

467
00:43:57,410 --> 00:44:01,840
and we found her in a club two days before her death.

468
00:44:02,201 --> 00:44:06,210
It was not difficult to find her on the club's CCTV.

469
00:44:06,535 --> 00:44:09,909
At 3 am, he left the club with a man...

470
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:13,180
and his body was found a day and a half later.

471
00:44:13,243 --> 00:44:17,127
The man in question was never a suspect.

472
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:20,714
But the unemployed Kwon Yu was immediately arrested...

473
00:44:21,035 --> 00:44:22,159
Captain! Get out of there!

474
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,160
The manager found you out! Fast!

475
00:44:25,285 --> 00:44:27,679
Hello? The wanted...

476
00:44:33,285 --> 00:44:36,429
Captain, come to the Namyang cafe in the Bukchang district.

477
00:44:37,035 --> 00:44:39,035
Let's meet there.

478
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,160
Welcome.

479
00:44:44,201 --> 00:44:46,378
A handsome young man.

480
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:54,587
Bye sweetheart!

481
00:44:58,868 --> 00:45:00,868
This is Namyang cafe.

482
00:45:01,451 --> 00:45:03,451
Does Mr. Hairy?

483
00:45:03,535 --> 00:45:06,133
Is there someone called "Captain"?

484
00:45:08,285 --> 00:45:10,383
Is there a "Captain"?

485
00:45:15,535 --> 00:45:17,963
It's a joke?

486
00:45:19,243 --> 00:45:21,075
Are you the "Captain"?

487
00:45:21,076 --> 00:45:24,960
Mr. Furry? Is this the correct site?

488
00:45:25,035 --> 00:45:27,075
I just arrived.

489
00:45:27,076 --> 00:45:29,076
Where are you?

490
00:45:45,285 --> 00:45:48,338
Who are you? Who are you?

491
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:56,034
Did Mr. Hairy send you?

492
00:45:56,035 --> 00:45:58,633
"Mr. Hairy."

493
00:46:01,285 --> 00:46:02,825
Does Mr. Hairy?

494
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:05,174
What's going on here?

495
00:46:05,493 --> 00:46:07,493
Who is this person?

496
00:46:09,785 --> 00:46:11,785
It is legit?

497
00:46:11,868 --> 00:46:13,920
- You can't... - It's me.

498
00:46:15,076 --> 00:46:17,076
That?

499
00:46:17,243 --> 00:46:18,674
The one in front of you.

500
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:20,675
Hello?

501
00:46:21,451 --> 00:46:23,451
I'm Mr. Hairy.

502
00:46:30,285 --> 00:46:33,304
But your voice...

503
00:46:33,993 --> 00:46:35,993
There is a voice app.

504
00:46:36,576 --> 00:46:38,576
It's a voice modulator.

505
00:47:32,076 --> 00:47:34,076
"Mr. Hairy."

506
00:47:36,993 --> 00:47:38,993
Sit anywhere.

507
00:47:39,701 --> 00:47:41,701
This is safe.

508
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,160
Rice delivery!

509
00:47:54,618 --> 00:47:56,618
Leave it right there.

510
00:47:56,743 --> 00:47:58,795
Who could live here?

511
00:48:03,826 --> 00:48:05,826
Heavens!

512
00:48:11,743 --> 00:48:13,659
Rice?

513
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:16,258
Don't you live alone?

514
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:18,924
Where do you want it, Mr. Hairy?

515
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:05,660
Yeah?

516
00:50:09,576 --> 00:50:11,576
They will arrive soon.

517
00:50:12,451 --> 00:50:15,834
Don't let them see you like that, you're still the captain.

518
00:50:27,035 --> 00:50:29,035
It was a walk.

519
00:50:34,868 --> 00:50:37,034
Mr. Furry! We also want

520
00:50:37,035 --> 00:50:38,012
Extra portion for me.

521
00:50:38,013 --> 00:50:40,013
It looks delicious!

522
00:50:40,451 --> 00:50:42,617
This neighborhood makes me hungry.

523
00:50:42,618 --> 00:50:44,700
I thought I was going to starve on that climb.

524
00:50:44,701 --> 00:50:47,345
There is no CCTV around and it is very safe as well.

525
00:50:47,368 --> 00:50:48,576
right, captain?

526
00:50:48,577 --> 00:50:50,577
So we finally meet?

527
00:50:51,868 --> 00:50:55,422
- Thank you. - I bought eggs on the way.

528
00:50:56,285 --> 00:51:00,761
We saw Mr. Hairy for the first time yesterday.

529
00:51:00,826 --> 00:51:03,128
She never came to our meetings...

530
00:51:03,285 --> 00:51:06,159
but after hearing that you ran away...

531
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,534
called us.

532
00:51:07,535 --> 00:51:09,242
- Sit down, sit down. - That wasn't all.

533
00:51:09,243 --> 00:51:13,200
He took control of my computer and made me see things.

534
00:51:13,201 --> 00:51:15,325
He only talks on the phone.

535
00:51:15,326 --> 00:51:18,617
Do you have sociophobia?

536
00:51:18,618 --> 00:51:22,001
I was moved by your movie.

537
00:51:23,326 --> 00:51:24,950
One moment, one moment.

538
00:51:24,951 --> 00:51:27,094
So they're all...

539
00:51:27,201 --> 00:51:28,450
This is Yong_guru.

540
00:51:28,451 --> 00:51:32,575
When Yongsan Mall went bankrupt...

541
00:51:32,576 --> 00:51:34,909
he is the legendary technician who became half unemployed.

542
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:37,212
And this is Demolition.

543
00:51:38,035 --> 00:51:40,534
I'm Demolition, I work in a special effects team.

544
00:51:40,535 --> 00:51:42,929
Those cool things you see in the movies...

545
00:51:43,076 --> 00:51:44,296
I work on them.

546
00:51:44,297 --> 00:51:46,117
He is a beginner.

547
00:51:46,118 --> 00:51:48,118
And I am...

548
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,669
Negative space, university professor of Architecture.

549
00:51:51,743 --> 00:51:53,966
Or so he says.

550
00:51:56,243 --> 00:51:57,084
Why is everyone...

551
00:51:57,085 --> 00:51:59,262
We can't stand to sit idly by and let you get framed.

552
00:51:59,368 --> 00:52:00,617
We must all help!

553
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:03,888
Thanks for the thought, but I can do it alone...

554
00:52:05,076 --> 00:52:06,909
That is not good, we must help.

555
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:09,200
I appreciate the intention...

556
00:52:09,201 --> 00:52:11,378
There are a couple who couldn't come...

557
00:52:11,451 --> 00:52:12,950
Support and Recognition.

558
00:52:12,951 --> 00:52:17,159
They broadcast online helping the young and lonely!

559
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,160
Stars in the adult industry!

560
00:52:19,368 --> 00:52:21,992
Did he mention where he was going?

561
00:52:21,993 --> 00:52:24,216
No, he didn't say anything.

562
00:52:29,951 --> 00:52:31,741
You must be a busy man.

563
00:52:31,742 --> 00:52:33,742
Yes a bit.

564
00:52:33,951 --> 00:52:37,950
If you call, let us know right away.

565
00:52:37,951 --> 00:52:38,592
Yeah.

566
00:52:38,593 --> 00:52:40,593
You can go.

567
00:52:41,035 --> 00:52:43,035
Good.

568
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,160
Listen...

569
00:52:50,285 --> 00:52:53,464
Do you still have your case files?

570
00:52:54,076 --> 00:52:56,076
Can I review them?

571
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:03,255
Stop snooping and get on with your work.

572
00:53:03,493 --> 00:53:04,908
Mr. Public Defender.

573
00:53:04,909 --> 00:53:06,742
Clear...

574
00:53:06,743 --> 00:53:07,950
Yes, Ms. Lee.

575
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:12,131
I visited Chairman Chu's workplace.

576
00:53:12,368 --> 00:53:16,377
I sent Kwon Yu's prison files to his email.

577
00:53:21,618 --> 00:53:23,618
Kwon Yu...

578
00:53:26,243 --> 00:53:28,243
Ma Duk-su?

579
00:53:28,326 --> 00:53:31,325
Drug smuggling, attempted murder, human smuggling...

580
00:53:31,326 --> 00:53:34,220
arms trade with gangsters.

581
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:37,963
Kwon has balls to hit him.

582
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:44,159
Fucking bastard! Look at the traffic behind!

583
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,617
I'll pour gasoline up your ass and light it up!

584
00:53:46,618 --> 00:53:48,136
Powerless son of a bitch!

585
00:53:48,137 --> 00:53:50,377
Take the bus, asshole!

586
00:53:53,785 --> 00:53:57,840
62n6089, "malhablado".

587
00:53:58,035 --> 00:54:00,035
Common pattern?

588
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:04,034
I have dissected recent violent crimes...

589
00:54:04,035 --> 00:54:06,200
that have similar traits.

590
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:09,095
Do we have to talk on the phone?

591
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,534
Am I the only one who thinks it's weird?

592
00:54:11,535 --> 00:54:13,367
What about the pattern?

593
00:54:13,368 --> 00:54:15,034
Most criminals tend to...

594
00:54:15,035 --> 00:54:17,159
hide evidence as much as possible.

595
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,784
Yes, that's what anyone would do.

596
00:54:19,785 --> 00:54:22,617
But the most important aspect of these cases is...

597
00:54:22,618 --> 00:54:26,718
that all the proofs are exposed as in an exhibition.

598
00:54:27,868 --> 00:54:28,715
How strong!

599
00:54:28,716 --> 00:54:29,159
Hey!

600
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:33,492
The suspect is caught within 24 hours of the crime...

601
00:54:33,493 --> 00:54:36,117
and their identities revealed even before the trial.

602
00:54:36,118 --> 00:54:39,700
But that alone cannot be seen as a common pattern.

603
00:54:39,701 --> 00:54:41,969
I think that's enough to establish a pattern.

604
00:54:42,535 --> 00:54:44,535
Do you feel this?

605
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:56,325
Look at this screen.

606
00:54:56,326 --> 00:54:58,617
I checked all the CCTV...

607
00:54:58,618 --> 00:55:03,159
in a radius of 1 km when the captain went there.

608
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,867
What about the truck?

609
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:05,683
They see him?

610
00:55:05,684 --> 00:55:07,492
It's a montage!

611
00:55:07,493 --> 00:55:08,825
It's fake, look!

612
00:55:08,826 --> 00:55:10,534
If you look at the time code...

613
00:55:10,535 --> 00:55:13,117
The truck looks like it's been there an hour.

614
00:55:13,118 --> 00:55:16,092
They wanted to hide where he went.

615
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:18,075
Exact.

616
00:55:18,076 --> 00:55:21,050
Was the truck also present in other cases?

617
00:55:25,326 --> 00:55:26,867
Who are those guys?

618
00:55:26,868 --> 00:55:30,843
I checked their registered addresses.

619
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:34,929
They all belong to a junkyard near lncheon.

620
00:55:37,243 --> 00:55:40,617
Negative and Yong were very jealous of me.

621
00:55:40,618 --> 00:55:42,618
Because I'm going with you.

622
00:55:48,535 --> 00:55:51,554
You are a god among gamers.

623
00:55:52,368 --> 00:55:54,511
There! Look!

624
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:56,825
It's really here!

625
00:55:56,826 --> 00:55:58,826
This is fat!

626
00:56:00,451 --> 00:56:02,451
Mr. Hairy was right.

627
00:56:04,535 --> 00:56:07,463
Suits in a junkyard look weird.

628
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:10,410
I'll follow the van.

629
00:56:10,618 --> 00:56:12,435
Can you keep the fort here?

630
00:56:12,436 --> 00:56:13,284
I?

631
00:56:13,285 --> 00:56:15,679
You can do it? Of course you can.

632
00:57:48,868 --> 00:57:51,512
Captain, the audi from before is back.

633
00:58:02,743 --> 00:58:05,796
What's happening? They're turning it into a refrigerator truck.

634
00:58:06,201 --> 00:58:07,700
Who are they?

635
00:58:07,701 --> 00:58:08,619
They go, they go

636
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:10,620
What I do?

637
00:58:13,535 --> 00:58:15,535
Go after them?

638
00:58:15,951 --> 00:58:17,951
I don't have a vehicle.

639
00:58:20,076 --> 00:58:22,076
Are you poly?

640
00:58:22,951 --> 00:58:24,951
Grandpa, quick!

641
00:58:25,618 --> 00:58:27,575
I was a marine!

642
00:58:27,576 --> 00:58:29,719
Captain! Captain!

643
00:58:31,743 --> 00:58:33,575
There, there, that building.

644
00:58:33,576 --> 00:58:35,970
They delivered a fridge.

645
00:58:36,826 --> 00:58:39,159
I tried everything to sneak in...

646
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:42,430
but I could not. What do we do?

647
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,367
I have it.

648
00:58:52,368 --> 00:58:54,492
Okay, Negative, Yong, come on in.

649
00:58:54,493 --> 00:58:58,468
Most technicians insist on coming in the morning.

650
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:01,717
They don't come running like us, we are responsible.

651
00:59:01,826 --> 00:59:04,220
Today people have no spirit.

652
00:59:05,535 --> 00:59:07,758
This is our specialist.

653
00:59:08,285 --> 00:59:10,508
A legend in his field.

654
00:59:11,326 --> 00:59:13,075
I'll go take a look.

655
00:59:13,076 --> 00:59:15,424
Ah, right, I don't know if you've heard...

656
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:19,051
the manager of a nearby apartment has just been fired.

657
00:59:19,826 --> 00:59:21,075
- Fired? - Yeah.

658
00:59:21,076 --> 00:59:24,909
He said he worked responsibly and trying hard...

659
00:59:24,910 --> 00:59:28,180
Yong_guru, find the main server and connect me to it.

660
00:59:28,535 --> 00:59:29,950
He wasn't picky...

661
00:59:29,951 --> 00:59:32,909
It was cheeky, wasn't it?

662
00:59:32,910 --> 00:59:34,950
What do you think? Do you agree?

663
00:59:34,951 --> 00:59:36,242
I don't understand...

664
00:59:36,243 --> 00:59:38,325
Main server... Main server...

665
00:59:38,326 --> 00:59:40,424
What I'm saying is...

666
00:59:40,576 --> 00:59:43,004
What was he saying?

667
00:59:43,993 --> 00:59:45,534
I lost the thread.

668
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:47,088
Where do you want to go?

669
00:59:47,089 --> 00:59:49,089
To nowhere.

670
00:59:49,826 --> 00:59:52,825
- None? - When I was 28 or so...

671
00:59:52,826 --> 00:59:54,575
- 28? - That is.

672
00:59:54,576 --> 00:59:56,534
- My hair... - Hair?

673
00:59:56,535 --> 01:00:01,215
We are similar, you are brighter than me.

674
01:00:02,285 --> 01:00:04,534
Why it takes so long?

675
01:00:04,535 --> 01:00:09,492
You can't diagnose and fix a problem in a hurry.

676
01:00:09,493 --> 01:00:13,492
Everything has to be checked and rechecked...

677
01:00:13,493 --> 01:00:15,534
so it doesn't happen again...

678
01:00:15,535 --> 01:00:17,535
Ready.

679
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:24,046
But it is also a piece of cake for an expert.

680
01:00:24,785 --> 01:00:26,536
Mr. Hairy, connected.

681
01:00:26,537 --> 01:00:28,537
Yes, thanks.

682
01:00:41,076 --> 01:00:43,094
Captain #1306.

683
01:00:48,826 --> 01:00:50,826
13th floor clear.

684
01:01:15,951 --> 01:01:18,159
- It's Noh Joon-young. - Do you know him?

685
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,367
He was the star of the TV show "The Witch's Boyfriend."

686
01:01:20,368 --> 01:01:22,887
It was a smash hit, now he's a celebrity.

687
01:01:23,493 --> 01:01:26,091
Is that Noh's house?

688
01:01:26,535 --> 01:01:29,304
That one! The box they delivered!

689
01:01:42,076 --> 01:01:44,325
Why is he dead in there?

690
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:46,326
Were they transporting a corpse?

691
01:01:46,368 --> 01:01:49,659
Life is vain, I was a rising star.

692
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:51,660
Captain, we have guests.

693
01:02:08,076 --> 01:02:10,219
What are they doing?

694
01:02:59,285 --> 01:03:01,587
Party preparations are over.

695
01:03:40,076 --> 01:03:43,284
Full of footprints, nails and saliva...

696
01:03:43,285 --> 01:03:46,759
it will not be easy to remove all evidence.

697
01:03:46,993 --> 01:03:49,825
I've put together a list of candidates.

698
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:52,879
173 in total, unemployed and temporary.

699
01:03:53,076 --> 01:03:55,742
Are you always so fast?

700
01:03:55,743 --> 01:03:57,743
No need to run.

701
01:03:58,868 --> 01:04:01,909
Our team can only work when the girl has been chosen!

702
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:03,700
President Chu won't stop calling me!

703
01:04:03,701 --> 01:04:05,701
Fine, fine, stop nagging.

704
01:04:08,076 --> 01:04:09,742
You know how this works...

705
01:04:09,743 --> 01:04:14,093
being out of work is not the only criteria.

706
01:05:12,285 --> 01:05:15,075
Let's trace the steps of Noh.

707
01:05:15,076 --> 01:05:17,076
"Noh Joan-young".

708
01:05:37,493 --> 01:05:39,493
"Credit Card Transactions".

709
01:05:45,743 --> 01:05:47,617
¿"Boss"?

710
01:05:47,618 --> 01:05:49,761
He spent a lot of time there.

711
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:57,511
Was he addicted to hostess clubs?

712
01:06:01,035 --> 01:06:06,546
Okay, let's take a look at the girls over there.

713
01:06:18,243 --> 01:06:19,700
"Big Brother".

714
01:06:19,701 --> 01:06:21,701
"Journalist Seo Ji-seung."

715
01:06:21,743 --> 01:06:24,575
- Hello? - I sent you a profile.

716
01:06:24,576 --> 01:06:26,699
Prepare a headline and draft.

717
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:27,825
Do it tonight.

718
01:06:27,826 --> 01:06:30,950
It won't be easy, I have other headlines...

719
01:06:30,951 --> 01:06:32,951
That?

720
01:06:34,201 --> 01:06:36,201
You can not do it?

721
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:39,799
Of course. I'll have it done for...

722
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:44,135
I pay you enough, be grateful.

723
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:48,784
The concept of this is...

724
01:06:48,785 --> 01:06:53,215
"Ghastly murder of a celebrity who harassed waitresses."

725
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:02,450
Who is it?

726
01:07:02,451 --> 01:07:05,550
I'm here to change the water filter.

727
01:07:05,743 --> 01:07:07,743
Good.

728
01:07:26,285 --> 01:07:28,633
"Big Brother: Traces Sent".

729
01:07:41,451 --> 01:07:43,799
"Medident dental laboratory".

730
01:08:03,285 --> 01:08:04,450
Yes, Mr. Min?

731
01:08:04,451 --> 01:08:05,867
Miss Lee.

732
01:08:05,868 --> 01:08:10,075
I need to get someone out of prison.

733
01:08:10,076 --> 01:08:12,076
Sooner.

734
01:08:12,451 --> 01:08:14,284
I investigated the owner of the farm.

735
01:08:14,285 --> 01:08:17,054
His name is Chu Sang-duk, Chairman of the Hyosin Group.

736
01:08:18,201 --> 01:08:21,471
Why does an actor die in another's house?

737
01:08:21,576 --> 01:08:23,075
I know.

738
01:08:23,076 --> 01:08:25,076
No questions.

739
01:08:27,076 --> 01:08:31,034
They are articles about Noh and Chu Ye-ri.

740
01:08:31,035 --> 01:08:31,845
¿ Chu Ye-ri?

741
01:08:31,846 --> 01:08:33,846
President Chu's daughter.

742
01:08:34,076 --> 01:08:37,075
The pieces are fitting.

743
01:08:37,076 --> 01:08:39,284
Are they framing the girl in the photo?

744
01:08:39,285 --> 01:08:39,712
I know!

745
01:08:39,713 --> 01:08:41,713
I said no questions.

746
01:08:45,743 --> 01:08:48,387
Mr. Hairy, can you find her?

747
01:08:49,076 --> 01:08:51,128
Do you see this footprint?

748
01:08:51,410 --> 01:08:54,088
They will go after her.

749
01:08:54,451 --> 01:08:56,451
I'll try.

750
01:09:10,951 --> 01:09:12,951
"Park Barber Shop".

751
01:09:14,743 --> 01:09:16,743
It's nice.

752
01:09:19,285 --> 01:09:21,285
How would you like it?

753
01:09:21,368 --> 01:09:24,137
As thick as possible.

754
01:09:26,535 --> 01:09:28,280
Touch the shampoo.

755
01:09:28,281 --> 01:09:30,281
Good.

756
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:43,867
Captain, installed the "bug".

757
01:09:43,868 --> 01:09:45,742
- Very good. - How is it so easy?

758
01:09:45,743 --> 01:09:48,546
That is why you should not click on any link.

759
01:09:48,576 --> 01:09:51,129
One click, and it's not your phone anymore.

760
01:09:52,410 --> 01:09:54,410
Fucking bitch!

761
01:09:54,410 --> 01:09:56,950
Why do not you answer me?

762
01:09:56,951 --> 01:09:59,075
It's pay day, did you forget?

763
01:09:59,076 --> 01:10:00,742
- I'm sorry! - Come here, bitch!

764
01:10:00,743 --> 01:10:03,341
Please give me a few more days!

765
01:10:03,826 --> 01:10:05,284
Give you a few more days?

766
01:10:05,285 --> 01:10:07,200
Fucking bitch!

767
01:10:07,201 --> 01:10:09,845
You don't answer me, you don't pay me!

768
01:10:11,701 --> 01:10:14,049
What are you looking at? They are having fun?

769
01:10:14,576 --> 01:10:17,129
Sell ​​the kidney if necessary!

770
01:10:18,076 --> 01:10:20,094
You do not deserve...

771
01:10:21,535 --> 01:10:23,535
¡Sueltame!

772
01:10:25,951 --> 01:10:27,951
Who the fuck are you?!

773
01:10:31,451 --> 01:10:33,451
I sent it last week.

774
01:10:37,576 --> 01:10:39,159
Impossible!

775
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:42,054
I have no more money to send you!

776
01:10:42,076 --> 01:10:45,129
If he needs the money, let him rob a house!

777
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:48,464
How can you say that to your brother?

778
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:51,804
You're important for sending a little change.

779
01:10:51,868 --> 01:10:52,622
Bitch!

780
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:54,623
Mother...

781
01:10:55,368 --> 01:10:57,841
Do you know how I earn that money?

782
01:10:58,160 --> 01:10:59,950
Don't call me again.

783
01:10:59,951 --> 01:11:01,951
I have reached the limit!

784
01:11:21,326 --> 01:11:23,628
"Mr. Hairy."

785
01:11:25,368 --> 01:11:27,159
Up all night?

786
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:29,160
You want breakfast?

787
01:11:30,243 --> 01:11:32,921
It's alright, when they wake up.

788
01:11:34,618 --> 01:11:37,091
You're still a fugitive...

789
01:11:37,951 --> 01:11:40,504
You can't meddle in other people's business.

790
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:44,160
Mr. Hairy, you're the one...

791
01:11:44,285 --> 01:11:46,285
helped my mother, right?

792
01:11:46,493 --> 01:11:48,493
Yeo-wool.

793
01:11:49,076 --> 01:11:51,076
My name.

794
01:11:51,535 --> 01:11:52,700
Hello?

795
01:11:52,701 --> 01:11:55,424
Hey, I found a wallet.

796
01:11:56,535 --> 01:11:58,284
I'll pay you 300,000.

797
01:11:58,285 --> 01:12:00,367
It's upstairs, in my bed.

798
01:12:00,368 --> 01:12:02,534
I found this number in the wallet.

799
01:12:02,535 --> 01:12:04,535
It's her.

800
01:12:05,285 --> 01:12:08,338
The woman who called me.

801
01:12:08,493 --> 01:12:12,969
Do you know Pentaportra apartments in Cheongdam district?

802
01:12:13,618 --> 01:12:16,717
Yes, yes, if he comes here I'll give it back to him.

803
01:12:16,826 --> 01:12:18,867
Thank you very much, I'll go right away.

804
01:12:18,868 --> 01:12:19,617
Good.

805
01:12:19,618 --> 01:12:21,670
He used the same method to attract me.

806
01:12:21,951 --> 01:12:23,951
We have to catch her.

807
01:12:29,335 --> 01:12:30,534
"Complete cheat."

808
01:12:30,535 --> 01:12:32,535
I need three minutes.

809
01:12:36,535 --> 01:12:39,509
Yes how can I help you?

810
01:12:40,493 --> 01:12:41,784
Hello?

811
01:12:41,785 --> 01:12:44,284
Get off me, you fucking charlatans!

812
01:12:44,285 --> 01:12:46,285
Hello?

813
01:12:47,451 --> 01:12:49,141
My son did not go!

814
01:12:49,142 --> 01:12:51,142
Life in prison without parole.

815
01:12:51,951 --> 01:12:53,951
Hello?

816
01:12:54,326 --> 01:12:56,799
Hello?

817
01:12:59,451 --> 01:13:01,451
what the fuck...

818
01:13:02,035 --> 01:13:05,464
Hello? You must be tired.

819
01:13:05,576 --> 01:13:08,492
I understand what you're trying to do.

820
01:13:08,493 --> 01:13:12,492
Hey pervert, do you like breathing on the phone?

821
01:13:12,493 --> 01:13:14,575
Bastard, did you call me a pervert?

822
01:13:14,576 --> 01:13:18,426
I'll rip your stomach open until your intestines fall out.

823
01:13:18,451 --> 01:13:20,451
Crack...

824
01:13:20,826 --> 01:13:22,617
Oh...

825
01:13:22,618 --> 01:13:24,450
fucking crazy...

826
01:13:24,451 --> 01:13:26,200
Are you really that bored?

827
01:13:26,201 --> 01:13:28,867
You are lazy, aren't you? A parasite, stupid.

828
01:13:28,868 --> 01:13:33,534
A parasite can not call? Bitch!

829
01:13:33,535 --> 01:13:34,784
I'm sorry, Mom.

830
01:13:34,785 --> 01:13:38,339
I just want to fuck, is that too much to ask?

831
01:13:38,993 --> 01:13:41,492
Do my obscenities turn you on?

832
01:13:41,493 --> 01:13:44,117
Obscenities turn you on, huh?

833
01:13:44,118 --> 01:13:46,992
You are the pervert, you win me over.

834
01:13:46,993 --> 01:13:49,200
Dear pervert customer...

835
01:13:49,201 --> 01:13:52,159
jerk off if you're horny, this is not an erotic line.

836
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:56,534
You're a slut, fuck you bitch!

837
01:13:56,535 --> 01:13:58,535
Hello?

838
01:14:06,243 --> 01:14:08,243
It's done.

839
01:14:15,118 --> 01:14:17,534
Hello? Is it Mr. Bae Young-deuk?

840
01:14:17,535 --> 01:14:19,617
I'm calling from Goryeo Resources.

841
01:14:19,618 --> 01:14:22,797
We have a night shift opening at a construction site.

842
01:14:22,826 --> 01:14:24,826
Is available?

843
01:14:24,826 --> 01:14:26,826
Yeah.

844
01:14:31,035 --> 01:14:34,214
You've been discovered, get off the map.

845
01:14:34,868 --> 01:14:36,825
It's him, right?!

846
01:14:36,826 --> 01:14:39,299
It's the fugitive, call the police!

847
01:15:25,451 --> 01:15:27,753
What the fuck is this?! Move the truck!

848
01:15:28,326 --> 01:15:29,784
I'm sorry!

849
01:15:29,785 --> 01:15:31,883
Leave it to you at once!

850
01:15:33,243 --> 01:15:35,243
You rapist!

851
01:15:35,368 --> 01:15:37,545
It's been a while, you son of a bitch!

852
01:15:40,451 --> 01:15:41,950
He's coming to.

853
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:43,575
- Raise it up. - Yes Boss.

854
01:15:43,576 --> 01:15:45,799
Do not resist.

855
01:15:47,535 --> 01:15:49,659
Aren't you curious how I got out?

856
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:51,660
Damn, I'm curious too.

857
01:15:52,118 --> 01:15:54,512
Remember this? You shot me with this.

858
01:15:55,076 --> 01:15:57,076
There it goes.

859
01:16:03,271 --> 01:16:04,950
Damn, look at that bastard.

860
01:16:04,951 --> 01:16:06,951
Sujétenlo.

861
01:16:10,035 --> 01:16:12,035
Kwon Yu, there he goes.

862
01:16:29,326 --> 01:16:32,379
Give me the knife, I want to cut his mouth.

863
01:16:39,243 --> 01:16:43,700
I'll make a big hole for you and bury you well...

864
01:16:43,701 --> 01:16:45,742
so rest in peace, okay?

865
01:16:45,743 --> 01:16:48,011
Fugitive Kwon Yu!

866
01:16:48,535 --> 01:16:52,117
I'm calling now that the fugitive doesn't see me.

867
01:16:52,118 --> 01:16:53,867
Please save me quickly.

868
01:16:53,868 --> 01:16:58,298
We'll rescue you soon, stay calm.

869
01:16:59,451 --> 01:17:00,617
Boss?

870
01:17:00,618 --> 01:17:02,909
The cops want this motherfucker.

871
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:04,075
Do not listen to them.

872
01:17:04,076 --> 01:17:06,367
The guy who took me out will take care of it.

873
01:17:06,368 --> 01:17:09,492
"Miss Lee" Miss Lee, we have another task.

874
01:17:09,493 --> 01:17:11,325
Don't do anything unnecessary.

875
01:17:11,326 --> 01:17:13,970
- Boss, boss! - We'll be moving shortly.

876
01:17:14,035 --> 01:17:16,159
The Central ordered us to withdraw.

877
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:18,160
What are you saying? We have a hostage in there.

878
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:19,825
I don't know, that was the order.

879
01:17:19,826 --> 01:17:21,617
Official! Please!

880
01:17:21,618 --> 01:17:24,842
He's trying to kill me, help me please!

881
01:17:27,410 --> 01:17:29,367
Get in here you fucking idiots!

882
01:17:29,368 --> 01:17:31,368
Come in! Come in! Come in!

883
01:17:32,910 --> 01:17:34,910
- What's that? - What's going on?

884
01:17:47,618 --> 01:17:49,159
We give up!

885
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:51,450
- We are allies. - Who are they?

886
01:17:51,451 --> 01:17:53,451
We are on the same side.

887
01:18:07,826 --> 01:18:10,094
Come up fast! hurry up

888
01:18:14,451 --> 01:18:16,242
What happened?

889
01:18:16,243 --> 01:18:19,217
You left this in the middle of the road.

890
01:18:19,451 --> 01:18:20,825
Thank you!

891
01:18:20,826 --> 01:18:22,017
how do you drive

892
01:18:22,018 --> 01:18:23,242
I don't have a card.

893
01:18:23,243 --> 01:18:23,821
That?

894
01:18:23,822 --> 01:18:25,822
I don't have a card.

895
01:18:26,826 --> 01:18:29,424
Get changed, I'll drive!

896
01:18:42,826 --> 01:18:44,826
But by the way...

897
01:18:45,076 --> 01:18:47,299
how did the cops know where he was?

898
01:18:52,493 --> 01:18:54,795
Hey buddy!

899
01:18:55,285 --> 01:18:57,075
Adjust the speed, asshole!

900
01:18:57,076 --> 01:18:59,970
Stop the car, bastard!

901
01:19:00,035 --> 01:19:02,429
Let's make your hole!

902
01:19:03,493 --> 01:19:06,637
I have it in the ass like a hunting dog.

903
01:19:08,243 --> 01:19:10,617
Bastard! Flip the car!

904
01:19:10,618 --> 01:19:11,825
Turn around!

905
01:19:11,826 --> 01:19:14,325
Boss, we're on a ramp...

906
01:19:14,326 --> 01:19:16,754
Turn around, dammit!

907
01:19:19,868 --> 01:19:20,675
What's that?

908
01:19:20,676 --> 01:19:22,676
Radiodetector.

909
01:19:22,701 --> 01:19:24,844
Yong_guru did it.

910
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:33,213
Why is that there?

911
01:19:33,285 --> 01:19:34,825
Wait wait!

912
01:19:34,826 --> 01:19:36,826
Wait.

913
01:20:00,826 --> 01:20:05,085
We lost your signal there, search carefully.

914
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:09,294
When you catch Kwon, you will be a free man.

915
01:20:09,326 --> 01:20:12,367
So he got me out of jail to bury Kwon.

916
01:20:12,368 --> 01:20:14,159
Must have power...

917
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:16,450
Focus on catching Kwon.

918
01:20:16,451 --> 01:20:19,425
Or you'll go back to jail.

919
01:20:20,743 --> 01:20:21,992
Did you hang up on me?

920
01:20:21,993 --> 01:20:24,261
He gave you your mother's necklace...

921
01:20:24,451 --> 01:20:27,284
but did it contain a tracker?

922
01:20:27,285 --> 01:20:32,546
And those gangsters should be in prison?

923
01:20:32,576 --> 01:20:35,800
Without Mr. Hairy, the captain might be in a grave.

924
01:20:37,201 --> 01:20:39,503
Who really is that lawyer?

925
01:20:40,951 --> 01:20:44,534
Shouldn't we go after the lawyer first?

926
01:20:44,535 --> 01:20:46,535
Yong_guru...

927
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:49,160
do you know how to make drones?

928
01:20:49,868 --> 01:20:51,868
¿Drones?

929
01:21:01,076 --> 01:21:02,909
How are you? And the sign?

930
01:21:02,910 --> 01:21:04,910
Clean.

931
01:21:05,285 --> 01:21:07,285
Wait.

932
01:21:07,535 --> 01:21:10,008
Leather jacket, is it new?

933
01:21:10,076 --> 01:21:12,076
Mr. Hairy bought it for me.

934
01:21:14,951 --> 01:21:16,951
Oh really?

935
01:21:17,410 --> 01:21:20,259
Yong is amazing with this.

936
01:21:20,326 --> 01:21:22,075
Yong_guru, you are amazing.

937
01:21:22,076 --> 01:21:26,085
I can't believe this guy is unemployed.

938
01:21:26,535 --> 01:21:28,159
That skin smells...

939
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:31,339
My father used to beat me for being silly like that.

940
01:21:32,993 --> 01:21:34,742
"Lawyer Min Chum-sang."

941
01:21:34,743 --> 01:21:36,659
I reviewed the budget increase...

942
01:21:36,660 --> 01:21:39,492
and transferred the money to the operatives.

943
01:21:39,493 --> 01:21:41,284
Good job.

944
01:21:41,285 --> 01:21:43,575
Can we hear what they say in the office?

945
01:21:43,576 --> 01:21:46,846
It uses lasers to detect sound waves.

946
01:21:46,868 --> 01:21:48,868
It's normal now.

947
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:52,713
We comply with your request.

948
01:21:52,743 --> 01:21:54,950
All leaked documents are destroyed...

949
01:21:54,951 --> 01:21:58,255
and related information is kept safe as secure.

950
01:21:58,743 --> 01:22:00,966
You know that Kwon Yu ran away, right?

951
01:22:01,368 --> 01:22:03,420
He already came here to visit.

952
01:22:03,451 --> 01:22:06,909
Take care of it before it becomes a problem.

953
01:22:06,910 --> 01:22:11,135
Min is more capable than we imagined.

954
01:22:11,535 --> 01:22:14,304
Please reassure the board.

955
01:22:14,368 --> 01:22:17,672
Long conversations can be compromising.

956
01:22:17,826 --> 01:22:20,094
I'll see you at the meeting.

957
01:22:23,535 --> 01:22:25,803
"Lawyer Min Chum-sang."

958
01:22:26,285 --> 01:22:29,054
Is that wretch a puppet?

959
01:22:29,743 --> 01:22:33,492
How can you organize it in that dilapidated office?

960
01:22:33,493 --> 01:22:37,502
You need loads of servers, that place doesn't seem appropriate.

961
01:22:37,618 --> 01:22:40,034
Maybe they have one outside.

962
01:22:40,035 --> 01:22:42,258
Yong, did you bring the metal scanner?

963
01:22:42,285 --> 01:22:44,303
Send another drone.

964
01:22:44,368 --> 01:22:46,368
Let's scan the building.

965
01:22:56,035 --> 01:22:58,588
Shit, is it embedded in there?

966
01:22:59,701 --> 01:23:01,701
It's like a safe.

967
01:23:01,993 --> 01:23:03,993
If they built a fortress...

968
01:23:04,035 --> 01:23:07,839
it means they have secrets they want to protect, right?

969
01:23:08,201 --> 01:23:11,584
Mr. Hairy can't you hack the site?

970
01:23:11,701 --> 01:23:16,086
You could take control of his computer like you did to us.

971
01:23:16,201 --> 01:23:20,159
I've tried, but I can't get through the firewall.

972
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:21,575
Damn.

973
01:23:21,576 --> 01:23:23,878
Everything would be solved if we went inside.

974
01:23:24,201 --> 01:23:25,825
Negative, any ideas?

975
01:23:25,826 --> 01:23:30,427
No one can enter unless someone opens the door.

976
01:23:30,701 --> 01:23:32,325
Let's call the cops.

977
01:23:32,326 --> 01:23:33,676
And if they are with them?

978
01:23:33,677 --> 01:23:35,159
So let's get into the media.

979
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:39,215
Did Mr. Hairy's video get aired?

980
01:23:39,368 --> 01:23:43,673
She's hiding because that put her on a watch list.

981
01:23:47,660 --> 01:23:49,660
I have an idea.

982
01:24:02,285 --> 01:24:03,575
Hello?

983
01:24:03,576 --> 01:24:05,844
We have a problem.

984
01:24:05,993 --> 01:24:08,295
- What's happening? - Noh's apartment was vandalized.

985
01:24:14,626 --> 01:24:16,926
"You are finished, Min Chun-sang."

986
01:24:18,826 --> 01:24:20,969
They cleaned up all the traces...

987
01:24:21,035 --> 01:24:23,450
and they mixed various hair samples together.

988
01:24:23,451 --> 01:24:25,674
We cannot know whose they are.

989
01:24:28,826 --> 01:24:30,826
It's good.

990
01:24:31,243 --> 01:24:33,075
How can you laugh?

991
01:24:33,076 --> 01:24:35,094
The news will be out tomorrow.

992
01:24:35,410 --> 01:24:37,410
Now what?

993
01:24:37,493 --> 01:24:39,742
Let's delay D-Day.

994
01:24:39,743 --> 01:24:43,217
Have the workers clean this place up.

995
01:24:50,493 --> 01:24:53,200
Send Noh's corpse to a discreet location.

996
01:24:53,201 --> 01:24:55,159
A country motel, perhaps.

997
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:58,543
And come back to collect samples.

998
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:02,825
Dad, any news on that bastard Min?

999
01:25:02,826 --> 01:25:04,284
How long do I have to stay here?

1000
01:25:04,285 --> 01:25:06,929
The food is crap and I can't stand the smell!

1001
01:25:07,493 --> 01:25:08,825
¡ Min Chum-sang!

1002
01:25:08,826 --> 01:25:10,969
- Is that how you work? - President Chu!

1003
01:25:10,993 --> 01:25:13,261
Do you know what my daughter is suffering right now?!

1004
01:25:13,535 --> 01:25:15,535
I raised her like a princess.

1005
01:25:17,951 --> 01:25:19,992
We all work day and night...

1006
01:25:19,993 --> 01:25:22,117
please be patient with us.

1007
01:25:22,118 --> 01:25:24,136
Give me the money! Answer!

1008
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:25,575
Give me my money!

1009
01:25:25,576 --> 01:25:27,576
Fuck...

1010
01:25:30,076 --> 01:25:32,925
Hell, everything pisses me off.

1011
01:25:35,118 --> 01:25:37,118
Who's the bastard?!

1012
01:25:37,743 --> 01:25:39,743
Well try it.

1013
01:25:51,818 --> 01:25:53,818
One two three!

1014
01:25:54,118 --> 01:25:56,118
"Party and event planners".

1015
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:00,912
"We know what they're doing."

1016
01:26:00,951 --> 01:26:02,951
What the hell?

1017
01:26:39,535 --> 01:26:41,803
Motherfucker! For! Please!

1018
01:26:47,076 --> 01:26:49,784
Kwon Yu is going after all of our operatives.

1019
01:26:49,785 --> 01:26:53,034
We can hire new people.

1020
01:26:53,035 --> 01:26:56,492
Do you want Chu's fights to continue?

1021
01:26:56,493 --> 01:26:59,637
Let's finish the job first.

1022
01:27:00,076 --> 01:27:02,575
No need to worry about Kwon...

1023
01:27:02,576 --> 01:27:04,242
I have it under control.

1024
01:27:04,243 --> 01:27:06,243
News time.

1025
01:27:09,285 --> 01:27:10,534
Let's see them together.

1026
01:27:10,535 --> 01:27:12,825
I'm in a vacant motel in Yesan.

1027
01:27:12,826 --> 01:27:16,617
The body of actor Noh Joon-young was found in a motel, after a week missing.

1028
01:27:16,618 --> 01:27:19,284
We received the information that Noh Joon-young was killed.

1029
01:27:19,285 --> 01:27:21,285
Forensics are on the scene...

1030
01:27:25,076 --> 01:27:27,754
They can't come in here!

1031
01:27:27,951 --> 01:27:29,951
Stand aside! move away!

1032
01:27:33,951 --> 01:27:35,951
¡ Es Chu Ye-ri! ¡Es Chu Ye-ri! Chu Ye-ri!

1033
01:27:35,951 --> 01:27:37,951
Take photos!

1034
01:27:40,951 --> 01:27:44,221
"The dead body of actor Noh Joon-young found in a motel".

1035
01:27:45,826 --> 01:27:48,075
Dad, how long do I have to stay here?

1036
01:27:48,076 --> 01:27:51,220
The food is crap and I can't stand the smell!

1037
01:27:57,910 --> 01:28:00,784
Chu Ye-ri, the daughter of President Chu of the Hyosin Group...

1038
01:28:00,785 --> 01:28:03,825
was found at the crime scene...

1039
01:28:03,826 --> 01:28:06,575
and arrested for murdering Noh.

1040
01:28:06,576 --> 01:28:09,909
What the hell is going on?! Why was my daughter there?!

1041
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:11,825
It will be hard to deny the charges.

1042
01:28:11,826 --> 01:28:15,700
Facing a tidal wave of criticism, President Chu faces...

1043
01:28:15,701 --> 01:28:18,659
the biggest threat of his life.

1044
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:20,883
"Unknown number".

1045
01:28:30,410 --> 01:28:33,088
- Kwonyu? -Did you like him?

1046
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:35,679
I copied your method.

1047
01:28:36,410 --> 01:28:39,075
Well, it was very surprising.

1048
01:28:39,076 --> 01:28:41,970
It's weird to be flattered by someone you want to kill.

1049
01:28:42,076 --> 01:28:46,836
It's true, lately it was very boring.

1050
01:28:48,410 --> 01:28:50,617
I got a high that is turning me on!

1051
01:28:50,618 --> 01:28:52,841
Time had passed.

1052
01:28:52,951 --> 01:28:55,003
Can you understand it?

1053
01:28:55,493 --> 01:28:58,717
This was pretty funny at first.

1054
01:28:58,743 --> 01:29:04,220
People were going to jail based on the scenarios I created...

1055
01:29:04,576 --> 01:29:10,212
and with the article he wrote, people laughed...

1056
01:29:11,076 --> 01:29:14,867
cried, or got angry.

1057
01:29:14,868 --> 01:29:17,136
The feeling of success...

1058
01:29:22,118 --> 01:29:25,825
So what, it's still a job, and it gets boring over time.

1059
01:29:25,826 --> 01:29:27,826
Everything is the same.

1060
01:29:32,118 --> 01:29:35,422
But lately I'm elated.

1061
01:29:35,451 --> 01:29:37,451
You are a threat.

1062
01:29:38,535 --> 01:29:41,179
No one has ever challenged me before...

1063
01:29:41,368 --> 01:29:44,137
but when you came after me...

1064
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:46,929
It bothered me, but it was also amazing!

1065
01:29:51,576 --> 01:29:53,576
Hello?

1066
01:30:08,660 --> 01:30:12,590
How dare you hang up while I'm talking.

1067
01:30:12,951 --> 01:30:14,951
hung up...

1068
01:30:16,076 --> 01:30:18,128
what a jerk

1069
01:30:21,076 --> 01:30:23,076
That's the problem.

1070
01:30:23,743 --> 01:30:26,546
I can't communicate with millennials.

1071
01:30:27,951 --> 01:30:29,951
It's very serious.

1072
01:30:30,701 --> 01:30:34,676
Stupid millennials!

1073
01:30:34,743 --> 01:30:37,825
It wasn't asking for much, was it?!

1074
01:30:37,826 --> 01:30:39,492
I was talking on the phone!

1075
01:30:39,493 --> 01:30:42,421
I can not comunicate! I do not understand them!

1076
01:31:46,951 --> 01:31:50,004
That hurts a lot.

1077
01:31:53,535 --> 01:31:55,633
It really hurts...

1078
01:32:26,326 --> 01:32:28,594
Are you still asleep?

1079
01:32:31,326 --> 01:32:32,575
Get up!

1080
01:32:32,576 --> 01:32:35,034
Were you up all night playing?

1081
01:32:35,035 --> 01:32:35,892
What about a dojo?

1082
01:32:35,893 --> 01:32:37,929
No taekwondo.

1083
01:32:38,868 --> 01:32:40,742
I'll fix it for you.

1084
01:32:40,743 --> 01:32:42,743
I will never do taekwondo again.

1085
01:32:45,201 --> 01:32:48,242
Please read this, my son is not a murderer!

1086
01:32:48,243 --> 01:32:49,867
Please read this.

1087
01:32:49,868 --> 01:32:51,325
Isn't it fun?

1088
01:32:51,326 --> 01:32:53,200
Please read this!

1089
01:32:53,201 --> 01:32:55,674
It gets better towards the end.

1090
01:32:56,493 --> 01:32:59,091
Ah, I'm sorry for killing your mom.

1091
01:33:00,535 --> 01:33:04,214
I know it's late, but I apologize.

1092
01:33:11,826 --> 01:33:14,659
Be good and listen to me...

1093
01:33:14,660 --> 01:33:16,075
Listen to me...

1094
01:33:16,076 --> 01:33:17,534
It is important...

1095
01:33:17,535 --> 01:33:18,742
Wait! Wait!

1096
01:33:18,743 --> 01:33:20,743
It's very important, you might regret...

1097
01:33:24,035 --> 01:33:25,825
Do you know why it happened to you?

1098
01:33:25,826 --> 01:33:28,424
You were born to horrible parents.

1099
01:33:29,743 --> 01:33:31,761
Motherfucker!

1100
01:33:31,951 --> 01:33:34,379
Motherfucker!

1101
01:33:45,285 --> 01:33:48,054
I know you feel bad...

1102
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:50,325
but that doesn't excuse you...

1103
01:33:50,326 --> 01:33:54,927
for hitting someone older.

1104
01:33:55,201 --> 01:33:56,575
Psychopath...

1105
01:33:56,576 --> 01:33:59,004
Anyway, it's almost time.

1106
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:02,160
"Mr. Hairy."

1107
01:34:02,951 --> 01:34:04,951
You should answer.

1108
01:34:09,451 --> 01:34:11,909
Yeo-wool? Hello?

1109
01:34:11,910 --> 01:34:14,838
Damn, let's meet again!

1110
01:34:15,618 --> 01:34:17,659
Team Name:: Resurrection.

1111
01:34:17,660 --> 01:34:21,992
Yong_guru, Demolition, Negative space...

1112
01:34:21,993 --> 01:34:23,450
and Mr. Hairy.

1113
01:34:23,451 --> 01:34:26,880
They will all die because of you.

1114
01:34:30,993 --> 01:34:35,423
If you touch them I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!

1115
01:34:35,618 --> 01:34:39,377
Sorry to return threat with threat...

1116
01:34:39,868 --> 01:34:42,887
but if you continue with this, they will all die.

1117
01:34:45,701 --> 01:34:47,867
I think I have broken ribs.

1118
01:34:47,868 --> 01:34:50,659
I knew you would come to steal my information...

1119
01:34:50,660 --> 01:34:54,009
That's why I sent Ma after your team.

1120
01:34:54,368 --> 01:34:57,968
The server is huge. It will take about 30 minutes.

1121
01:34:58,326 --> 01:35:02,927
Although with that you will be a free man.

1122
01:35:05,243 --> 01:35:09,173
But your friends will die like dogs.

1123
01:35:11,076 --> 01:35:13,128
That's a shame.

1124
01:35:15,410 --> 01:35:19,510
I will kill you and rescue my companions.

1125
01:35:21,743 --> 01:35:24,796
I'm sorry for your tenacity...

1126
01:35:27,868 --> 01:35:32,469
but I told Ma that if I don't call him in 15 minutes...

1127
01:35:32,576 --> 01:35:34,659
I had to execute them all.

1128
01:35:34,660 --> 01:35:37,213
Maybe I shouldn't have.

1129
01:35:37,868 --> 01:35:40,341
Take the information and that's it.

1130
01:35:40,618 --> 01:35:43,034
You ran away to clear your name...

1131
01:35:43,035 --> 01:35:45,035
shouldn't you take care of that?

1132
01:35:49,410 --> 01:35:51,804
Forget them.

1133
01:35:52,285 --> 01:35:56,169
Nobody cares if they die.

1134
01:35:56,243 --> 01:35:58,243
Sooner or later they will all die...

1135
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:10,534
I forgot to mention something, sorry.

1136
01:36:10,535 --> 01:36:14,294
That friend of yours, Mr. Hairy.

1137
01:36:14,826 --> 01:36:16,826
Yoon-wool.

1138
01:36:19,076 --> 01:36:21,076
It will be our substitute.

1139
01:36:21,076 --> 01:36:25,256
My men should be collecting your samples now.

1140
01:36:26,951 --> 01:36:28,534
Mr. S.S. Hairy!

1141
01:36:28,535 --> 01:36:33,887
"Hermit Hacker Murders Noh Actor".

1142
01:36:33,993 --> 01:36:37,217
The news will hit the internet in the morning.

1143
01:36:37,826 --> 01:36:39,826
Fantastic, isn't it?

1144
01:36:41,410 --> 01:36:43,075
He may be a genius.

1145
01:36:43,076 --> 01:36:46,676
For! For bastard!

1146
01:36:46,701 --> 01:36:49,595
And your other friends...

1147
01:36:50,493 --> 01:36:54,423
I ordered Ma to kill them now.

1148
01:36:54,951 --> 01:36:58,050
By the time you get there they'll be dead...

1149
01:36:58,285 --> 01:36:59,534
so get out of town.

1150
01:36:59,535 --> 01:37:03,534
You will arrive in time to feel their cold bodies.

1151
01:37:03,535 --> 01:37:06,179
Do not do it! Motherfucker!

1152
01:37:06,576 --> 01:37:08,628
Fuck!

1153
01:37:09,285 --> 01:37:11,804
You shouldn't have touched me.

1154
01:37:12,243 --> 01:37:14,243
bastard!

1155
01:37:17,368 --> 01:37:20,421
Do you know why they will die?

1156
01:37:21,535 --> 01:37:23,535
Who should I kill first?

1157
01:37:24,618 --> 01:37:26,450
Please wait!

1158
01:37:26,451 --> 01:37:28,451
Old man, you first.

1159
01:37:35,868 --> 01:37:37,886
Negative!

1160
01:37:39,076 --> 01:37:40,534
He is not dead?

1161
01:37:40,535 --> 01:37:41,950
What is this?

1162
01:37:41,951 --> 01:37:45,380
Wait! Let's talk! We can fix this!

1163
01:37:49,743 --> 01:37:51,242
It's defective?

1164
01:37:51,243 --> 01:37:53,671
He never served in the Army.

1165
01:38:00,035 --> 01:38:02,212
- Mr. Furry! - Get rid of her.

1166
01:38:03,368 --> 01:38:05,420
Get her out of here!

1167
01:38:05,493 --> 01:38:07,409
Don't do it! You bastards!

1168
01:38:07,410 --> 01:38:09,410
Give me your gun.

1169
01:38:12,951 --> 01:38:14,242
Moron!

1170
01:38:14,243 --> 01:38:15,992
Wait! Wait!

1171
01:38:15,993 --> 01:38:21,129
Let's talk! Let's talk! Don't shoot me!

1172
01:38:21,243 --> 01:38:23,341
We can talk about this!

1173
01:38:23,368 --> 01:38:26,450
Look at me! Ugly piece of shit!

1174
01:38:26,451 --> 01:38:28,742
Look at me, fuck!

1175
01:38:28,743 --> 01:38:32,075
Do not shoot! Do not do it! Bastard!

1176
01:38:32,076 --> 01:38:34,504
I can not concentrate! Shut the fuck up!

1177
01:38:34,868 --> 01:38:36,868
Do you want to die first?

1178
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:39,588
I have a mother...

1179
01:38:40,076 --> 01:38:41,867
Good.

1180
01:38:41,868 --> 01:38:43,450
You will die first anyway.

1181
01:38:43,451 --> 01:38:45,659
Wait, sir, wait, wait a minute!

1182
01:38:45,660 --> 01:38:48,554
What happened? What's going on?!

1183
01:38:48,826 --> 01:38:50,742
I think it's a blackout.

1184
01:38:50,743 --> 01:38:53,011
A fucking blackout?!

1185
01:38:53,368 --> 01:38:55,368
Boss! There!

1186
01:38:56,076 --> 01:38:59,585
High! Stop shooting! Fuck!

1187
01:38:59,826 --> 01:39:01,575
High! High!

1188
01:39:01,576 --> 01:39:03,576
Light the lighter!

1189
01:39:14,076 --> 01:39:16,076
Is dead?

1190
01:39:16,701 --> 01:39:18,701
You found it?

1191
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:49,450
hurry up hurry up

1192
01:40:49,451 --> 01:40:51,451
Negative, quick!

1193
01:40:52,951 --> 01:40:54,367
Stop there!

1194
01:40:54,368 --> 01:40:57,217
catch him! The one in the fur jacket!

1195
01:41:01,951 --> 01:41:03,951
High!

1196
01:41:07,035 --> 01:41:09,035
Faster! Faster!

1197
01:41:15,243 --> 01:41:16,399
Behind them!

1198
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:18,400
Greyhound!

1199
01:41:20,576 --> 01:41:22,576
They are coming!

1200
01:41:24,285 --> 01:41:27,589
Why are they running away? He fights fucking good!

1201
01:41:32,451 --> 01:41:34,451
Car ahead!

1202
01:41:40,493 --> 01:41:44,297
It is very narrow! Impossible! High!

1203
01:41:49,118 --> 01:41:51,796
Come on!

1204
01:41:57,410 --> 01:41:59,410
Damn!

1205
01:42:00,035 --> 01:42:02,659
Is it the best you can do?

1206
01:42:02,660 --> 01:42:04,288
Call Yong-pal!

1207
01:42:04,289 --> 01:42:05,367
That?

1208
01:42:05,368 --> 01:42:07,617
Bring Yong-pal, you jerk!

1209
01:42:07,618 --> 01:42:09,534
Bring the car!

1210
01:42:09,535 --> 01:42:11,242
Hey, Ma...

1211
01:42:11,243 --> 01:42:14,450
I will send you the location of Kwon Yu.

1212
01:42:14,451 --> 01:42:17,550
so catch it please!

1213
01:42:29,535 --> 01:42:31,678
Boss, I'm here!

1214
01:42:31,826 --> 01:42:33,826
Yong-pal to the rescue!

1215
01:42:34,410 --> 01:42:36,883
I'll get you anyway!

1216
01:42:49,410 --> 01:42:51,410
It seems fun.

1217
01:42:51,951 --> 01:42:54,049
Why don't I give you a hand?

1218
01:43:00,410 --> 01:43:02,410
It's the loudmouth.

1219
01:43:05,243 --> 01:43:08,342
- What the hell? - How about a ride on the roller coaster?

1220
01:43:18,285 --> 01:43:20,285
Yong-pal, come on! Come on!

1221
01:43:20,285 --> 01:43:22,285
Come on! Come on!

1222
01:43:30,618 --> 01:43:32,670
Ah... there!

1223
01:43:53,493 --> 01:43:55,511
There!

1224
01:43:56,826 --> 01:43:58,826
Careful, careful!

1225
01:44:19,493 --> 01:44:21,493
Where I am?

1226
01:44:29,076 --> 01:44:31,076
What are those?!

1227
01:44:33,535 --> 01:44:35,034
Catch the bastard.

1228
01:44:35,035 --> 01:44:36,659
Understood?

1229
01:44:36,660 --> 01:44:38,660
Catch the bastard! Fuck!

1230
01:45:08,826 --> 01:45:10,284
Is it the TV station?

1231
01:45:10,285 --> 01:45:12,492
I would like to give a notice.

1232
01:45:12,493 --> 01:45:15,342
It's about the fugitive Kwon Yu...

1233
01:45:23,660 --> 01:45:27,009
Is that son of a bitch really trying to kill us?

1234
01:45:31,660 --> 01:45:34,588
I feel terrible.

1235
01:45:36,368 --> 01:45:38,420
It's almost time for the news.

1236
01:45:42,785 --> 01:45:44,617
Motherfucker.

1237
01:45:44,618 --> 01:45:46,242
- Last News! - Informative advance!

1238
01:45:46,243 --> 01:45:48,766
- Just arrived! - Identified the murderer of Noh...

1239
01:45:48,767 --> 01:45:50,909
such as the fugitive Kwon Yu.

1240
01:45:50,910 --> 01:45:52,742
Kwon Yu, killed Noh and kidnapped Chu Ye-ri. It's the real killer.

1241
01:45:52,743 --> 01:45:57,909
Police CCTV shows Kwon Yu...

1242
01:45:57,910 --> 01:46:01,700
and his followers, known as "Resurrection"...

1243
01:46:01,701 --> 01:46:05,335
kidnapping and taking Chu Ye-ri to the crime scene.

1244
01:46:05,410 --> 01:46:07,136
The problem is the motley crew.

1245
01:46:07,137 --> 01:46:09,034
Kwon Yu's followers helped him kill. Delivered to video games...

1246
01:46:09,035 --> 01:46:11,450
homemade bombs...

1247
01:46:11,451 --> 01:46:14,534
A psychotic criminal gang on a crime spree.

1248
01:46:14,535 --> 01:46:17,634
They called us a psychotic criminal gang.

1249
01:46:17,910 --> 01:46:19,950
Damn! Now the cops are after us!

1250
01:46:19,951 --> 01:46:21,534
It is getting worse.

1251
01:46:21,535 --> 01:46:23,200
Get him before the cops!

1252
01:46:23,201 --> 01:46:25,344
Whoever catches it has a great prize!

1253
01:46:27,785 --> 01:46:32,135
Kwon Yu, are you a game addict?

1254
01:46:32,326 --> 01:46:34,326
"President Chu."

1255
01:46:35,326 --> 01:46:38,755
Mr. Min, she knew she would get out!

1256
01:46:38,826 --> 01:46:41,094
He's a genius!

1257
01:46:46,243 --> 01:46:48,450
We will be fine?

1258
01:46:48,451 --> 01:46:50,451
We almost arrive.

1259
01:46:54,285 --> 01:46:57,075
While the fugitive Kwon was imprisoned...

1260
01:46:57,076 --> 01:47:01,631
he was known for regularly assaulting his fellow inmates.

1261
01:47:01,701 --> 01:47:03,909
Perhaps our society has created a monster.

1262
01:47:03,910 --> 01:47:06,679
Considering the revenge killings...

1263
01:47:06,701 --> 01:47:09,345
We are safe?

1264
01:47:17,618 --> 01:47:19,618
Do you have that?

1265
01:47:20,868 --> 01:47:23,011
They come here, two cranes!

1266
01:47:35,535 --> 01:47:37,992
Yeo-wool went down, catch her.

1267
01:47:37,993 --> 01:47:39,617
Yeo-wool is the girl.

1268
01:47:39,618 --> 01:47:41,618
It's your last chance.

1269
01:47:41,660 --> 01:47:42,784
Dude, I'm busy, I...

1270
01:47:42,785 --> 01:47:44,785
Damn, did he hang up again?!

1271
01:47:44,910 --> 01:47:46,910
He has no manners!

1272
01:47:52,418 --> 01:47:53,617
Good, let's go!

1273
01:47:53,618 --> 01:47:54,825
Attention please.

1274
01:47:54,826 --> 01:47:59,711
There are armed intruders in the studio. Please vacate the building. Attention...

1275
01:48:04,618 --> 01:48:06,761
Faster Faster!

1276
01:48:18,410 --> 01:48:19,534
Can you all hear me?

1277
01:48:19,535 --> 01:48:20,659
- Yes captain. - Captain.

1278
01:48:20,660 --> 01:48:21,825
- Captain. - Received.

1279
01:48:21,826 --> 01:48:25,050
We have to buy Mr. Hairy time while he gets ready.

1280
01:48:26,368 --> 01:48:28,368
And thank you all...

1281
01:48:29,035 --> 01:48:30,200
for helping me.

1282
01:48:30,201 --> 01:48:33,409
How many times have you saved our asses?

1283
01:48:33,410 --> 01:48:34,825
Especially Mr. Hairy.

1284
01:48:34,826 --> 01:48:37,800
She leveled up by following the captain.

1285
01:48:37,868 --> 01:48:39,950
We will annihilate them.

1286
01:48:39,951 --> 01:48:41,700
This is not a game.

1287
01:48:41,701 --> 01:48:43,701
It could be really dangerous.

1288
01:48:46,701 --> 01:48:49,345
Well here we go.

1289
01:48:49,660 --> 01:48:51,883
Captain, I request orders.

1290
01:48:54,451 --> 01:48:56,879
Okay, Resurrection, are you ready?

1291
01:48:56,951 --> 01:48:58,659
Let's fight without regrets.

1292
01:48:58,660 --> 01:48:59,784
Received.

1293
01:48:59,785 --> 01:49:01,785
Yong_guru, waiting.

1294
01:49:02,576 --> 01:49:05,550
Calm, calm, calm...

1295
01:49:12,951 --> 01:49:14,409
Yeah!

1296
01:49:14,410 --> 01:49:16,285
Demolition, shoot them when I pass.

1297
01:49:16,286 --> 01:49:17,575
Don't worry.

1298
01:49:17,576 --> 01:49:19,970
It will be like the Dark Knight.

1299
01:49:20,410 --> 01:49:23,700
When you pass and the crane arrives...

1300
01:49:23,701 --> 01:49:26,825
I'll lift them up with my cable.

1301
01:49:26,826 --> 01:49:30,551
I told you I worked in the movie industry.

1302
01:49:41,243 --> 01:49:42,575
Shit, that's not good.

1303
01:49:42,576 --> 01:49:44,970
I knew you were just a facade.

1304
01:50:00,868 --> 01:50:02,742
Bump into him!

1305
01:50:02,743 --> 01:50:04,743
Get through it!

1306
01:50:13,535 --> 01:50:15,284
Captain, are you okay?

1307
01:50:15,285 --> 01:50:17,285
I'm fine.

1308
01:50:17,826 --> 01:50:19,826
Ready for the next phase!

1309
01:50:37,576 --> 01:50:39,970
Good job Yong_guru!

1310
01:50:40,035 --> 01:50:42,035
Yeah!

1311
01:50:48,326 --> 01:50:50,784
Demo! The captain draws them to you!

1312
01:50:50,785 --> 01:50:52,785
Not yet! It's not ready!

1313
01:50:57,160 --> 01:50:59,160
No, no, not yet!

1314
01:51:00,660 --> 01:51:02,660
demo now!

1315
01:51:18,660 --> 01:51:21,713
Good demo! Next phase!

1316
01:51:22,743 --> 01:51:24,409
Mr. Furry! Furry!

1317
01:51:24,410 --> 01:51:26,410
What's going on? Yeo-wool?

1318
01:51:33,618 --> 01:51:35,618
Be quiet!

1319
01:51:50,868 --> 01:51:52,868
I'm sorry!

1320
01:51:54,076 --> 01:51:55,284
It's my fault!

1321
01:51:55,285 --> 01:51:57,285
Stay still!

1322
01:52:25,660 --> 01:52:27,928
¡Yeo-wool! ¡Yeo-wool! ¡Yeo-wool!

1323
01:52:30,660 --> 01:52:32,758
Bye you scumbag!

1324
01:52:42,160 --> 01:52:44,160
Bastard!

1325
01:52:44,243 --> 01:52:46,243
Yeo-wool, cross over!

1326
01:52:46,868 --> 01:52:48,868
For!

1327
01:52:52,743 --> 01:52:54,743
Boss! I'm here!

1328
01:52:56,951 --> 01:52:58,617
Asshole, shoot well!

1329
01:52:58,618 --> 01:53:00,670
Sorry boss! What happened?

1330
01:53:10,535 --> 01:53:12,535
fucking useless...

1331
01:53:17,951 --> 01:53:20,424
Closer, closer, closer...

1332
01:53:26,535 --> 01:53:28,535
- Captain! - Yeo-wool, come up!

1333
01:53:28,951 --> 01:53:30,951
No way!

1334
01:54:26,743 --> 01:54:29,325
0187, found suspicious vehicle.

1335
01:54:29,326 --> 01:54:31,344
Going through the Sangam junction.

1336
01:54:32,035 --> 01:54:34,035
18, I request reinforcements.

1337
01:54:34,368 --> 01:54:37,421
All units go to Sangam Junction.

1338
01:54:37,451 --> 01:54:40,220
Command center, send reinforcements.

1339
01:54:41,160 --> 01:54:43,838
Go around the TV station.

1340
01:54:44,493 --> 01:54:47,842
18, cut his retreat route, lure him to the third block.

1341
01:54:48,701 --> 01:54:51,504
Elite marksmen, you can open fire.

1342
01:54:51,660 --> 01:54:53,450
The suspect may be armed.

1343
01:54:53,451 --> 01:54:55,659
The fugitive Kwon Yu is coming!

1344
01:54:55,660 --> 01:54:57,660
He may be here to turn himself in.

1345
01:54:57,660 --> 01:55:00,304
They are watching a live broadcast.

1346
01:55:18,118 --> 01:55:20,118
"Live broadcast of Kwon Yu's arrest."

1347
01:55:37,243 --> 01:55:39,243
What about this?

1348
01:55:54,243 --> 01:55:56,295
Wake up, we are here.

1349
01:55:57,660 --> 01:55:58,992
We are already here?

1350
01:55:58,993 --> 01:56:00,950
Captain, I brought in Support and Recon.

1351
01:56:00,951 --> 01:56:03,159
Captain, I missed you!

1352
01:56:03,160 --> 01:56:04,534
There she goes again.

1353
01:56:04,535 --> 01:56:06,450
Captain, was it hard?

1354
01:56:06,451 --> 01:56:07,950
It's good to hear them.

1355
01:56:07,951 --> 01:56:11,130
Mr. Hairy, did you get all the data?

1356
01:56:36,951 --> 01:56:38,951
Altogether.

1357
01:56:43,535 --> 01:56:47,385
Mr. Hairy will block the normal news and broadcast ours.

1358
01:56:47,451 --> 01:56:49,075
Do this right.

1359
01:56:49,076 --> 01:56:51,970
They'll melt if you keep up with it.

1360
01:56:52,326 --> 01:56:54,720
- What nerves... - Ready?

1361
01:56:59,576 --> 01:57:03,617
The truth about the killer of the century, Kwon Yu.

1362
01:57:03,618 --> 01:57:07,047
We will offer it to you exclusively by entering 69.

1363
01:57:07,993 --> 01:57:10,762
Did he really kill the sexy Noh Joon-young?

1364
01:57:11,076 --> 01:57:13,076
That's the truth?

1365
01:57:18,660 --> 01:57:21,617
My daughter screwed up.

1366
01:57:21,618 --> 01:57:24,867
He is an actor named Noh Joon-young.

1367
01:57:24,868 --> 01:57:26,992
I think he is a failure.

1368
01:57:26,993 --> 01:57:30,117
He is the president of Hyosin Group, right?

1369
01:57:30,118 --> 01:57:32,242
Dad, I'm hungry.

1370
01:57:32,243 --> 01:57:35,046
That bitch is the Noh killer.

1371
01:57:35,201 --> 01:57:39,586
So what is the truth behind Kwon Yu's rape and murder?

1372
01:57:39,743 --> 01:57:42,922
My son made a mistake, he must have been drunk.

1373
01:57:43,160 --> 01:57:47,510
At his age he is prone to mistakes, even to kill.

1374
01:57:48,201 --> 01:57:50,924
You must be nervous before the big day.

1375
01:57:50,951 --> 01:57:52,534
- That is not you? - That?

1376
01:57:52,535 --> 01:57:54,575
Who murdered Ha Ji-su...

1377
01:57:54,576 --> 01:57:55,784
I'm screwed up...

1378
01:57:55,785 --> 01:57:58,742
He was the son of Councilor Park, who wrote the Kwon Yu law.

1379
01:57:58,743 --> 01:58:01,492
But instead Kwon Yu was arrested.

1380
01:58:01,493 --> 01:58:02,909
Did you see the news?

1381
01:58:02,910 --> 01:58:05,117
Will Kwon make it to the trial?

1382
01:58:05,118 --> 01:58:07,867
- I'm Min Chum-sang. - Sons of bitches!

1383
01:58:07,868 --> 01:58:09,868
"Sons of bitches"...

1384
01:58:10,576 --> 01:58:12,284
I'm turning red...

1385
01:58:12,285 --> 01:58:13,950
This is news!

1386
01:58:13,951 --> 01:58:16,549
Ms. Lee... Ms. Read?

1387
01:58:19,535 --> 01:58:22,284
Aren't you curious about the master of this puppet?

1388
01:58:22,285 --> 01:58:25,200
Min, I'm in trouble. I killed my wife by accident.

1389
01:58:25,201 --> 01:58:26,992
"A drifter arrested for murder."

1390
01:58:26,993 --> 01:58:30,117
His corpse will be found inside...

1391
01:58:30,118 --> 01:58:32,118
from a container, tomorrow in Jamsil.

1392
01:58:32,118 --> 01:58:34,341
What are you guys doing?

1393
01:58:34,743 --> 01:58:35,869
- They have done? - Min!

1394
01:58:35,870 --> 01:58:37,360
You saved my neck!

1395
01:58:37,361 --> 01:58:38,325
Thank you!

1396
01:58:38,326 --> 01:58:39,659
"Identity of Busan Torso Killer Revealed".

1397
01:58:39,660 --> 01:58:41,450
It was a great idea.

1398
01:58:41,451 --> 01:58:43,242
How should I pay you?

1399
01:58:43,243 --> 01:58:46,877
My office manager will call you soon.

1400
01:58:47,160 --> 01:58:49,575
Mr. Min, you are a genius.

1401
01:58:49,576 --> 01:58:52,242
Yes, it may be.

1402
01:58:52,243 --> 01:58:54,545
His is innate.

1403
01:58:54,576 --> 01:58:57,629
Detectives please. I'm sorry!

1404
01:58:57,660 --> 01:58:59,712
They should tear it to pieces.

1405
01:59:00,576 --> 01:59:03,742
People were going to jail based on the scenarios I created...

1406
01:59:03,743 --> 01:59:07,468
and with the article he wrote, people laughed...

1407
01:59:07,535 --> 01:59:12,417
Min Chum-sang is the son of a bitch who controlled everything.

1408
01:59:12,418 --> 01:59:13,617
Enough. bastards...

1409
01:59:13,618 --> 01:59:15,784
This is the guy who deserves to die.

1410
01:59:15,785 --> 01:59:17,034
¡Paren!

1411
01:59:17,035 --> 01:59:21,340
We will issue our data before delivering it...

1412
01:59:21,368 --> 01:59:24,717
so anyone harmed by it will be able to use them.

1413
01:59:24,910 --> 01:59:29,534
And officers, catch Min before he takes off!

1414
01:59:29,535 --> 01:59:31,535
How dare you challenge me?

1415
01:59:36,076 --> 01:59:38,076
The steering wheel...

1416
01:59:41,793 --> 01:59:45,798
Min Chum-sang, I took your flyer, you son of a bitch!

1417
01:59:50,535 --> 01:59:53,617
What do we do? He is completely unmasked.

1418
01:59:53,618 --> 01:59:57,092
Don't worry, it's replaceable.

1419
01:59:57,160 --> 02:00:02,075
One wrongful conviction is worse than losing ten criminals.

1420
02:00:02,076 --> 02:00:04,128
Aren't they smarter now?

1421
02:00:05,243 --> 02:00:07,762
Anyone can be framed.

1422
02:00:08,660 --> 02:00:11,034
That ends today's news.

1423
02:00:11,035 --> 02:00:13,742
I'm the sexy girl, Support.

1424
02:00:13,743 --> 02:00:15,743
Good! Very good!

1425
02:00:21,576 --> 02:00:23,576
Next.

1426
02:00:47,035 --> 02:00:49,035
¡Sr. Ma!

1427
02:00:49,826 --> 02:00:51,826
Excellent!

1428
02:00:57,451 --> 02:00:59,451
Is he?

1429
02:01:02,576 --> 02:01:05,425
Guys, what are you doing? They shouldn't do that.

1430
02:01:07,826 --> 02:01:10,367
Kwon Yu, who was framed and jailed for murder...

1431
02:01:10,368 --> 02:01:13,325
he was cleared of all charges and became a free man.

1432
02:01:13,326 --> 02:01:17,325
The authorities are also collecting public opinions...

1433
02:01:17,326 --> 02:01:22,117
on compensation for wrongfully convicted...

1434
02:01:22,118 --> 02:01:24,796
and the prevention of future similar convictions.

1435
02:01:24,910 --> 02:01:30,046
- The real murderer of Ha Ji-su - Honey, there are the keys!

1436
02:01:30,118 --> 02:01:31,909
And Councilor Park's son...

1437
02:01:31,910 --> 02:01:35,339
Park Jae-hyun was arrested after hiding in a motel for 40 days.

1438
02:01:43,493 --> 02:01:45,493
Everybody said...

1439
02:01:45,493 --> 02:01:47,636
that the tree was rotting.

1440
02:01:49,326 --> 02:01:51,034
But I told them...

1441
02:01:51,035 --> 02:01:53,929
which was far from it.

1442
02:01:54,951 --> 02:01:58,758
That night I had a dream.

1443
02:01:59,535 --> 02:02:01,535
In dream...

1444
02:02:01,535 --> 02:02:05,284
I saw the tree growing strong towards the blue sky.

1445
02:02:05,285 --> 02:02:08,464
I got everyone together and told them...

1446
02:02:10,868 --> 02:02:16,004
that the tree was not rotting.

1447
02:02:18,493 --> 02:02:20,493
This tree...

1448
02:02:20,618 --> 02:02:22,618
it is not a rotten tree.
