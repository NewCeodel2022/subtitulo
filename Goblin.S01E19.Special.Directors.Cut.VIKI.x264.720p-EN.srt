The people called him God. (Shin=God)

Covered in red blood, he slashed his enemies,

36
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,800
he was literally a god of war.

37
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,560
If a soul dwells in an object that has been touched by human hands or drenched in blood,

38
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,390
he becomes a goblin.

Let Yeo marry your sister and protect him.

45
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,450

46

Put down your sword along with your rage and concerns.

I protected the borders because you told me to.

54
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,480
I killed the enemies when you told me to.

55

My sister is here and my people--

56

[Kim Shin is accused of being a traitor because the king fell for Park Joong Hun's plot.]

58
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,680
The traitor Kim Shin is to put his sword down and kneel down to accept the king's command.

59
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,650
What do you mean traitor? Are you crazy?

60
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,850
Have you gone out of your mind?

61
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:02,600
It's treason! Don't let anyone in that household live!

62
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,580
It's an order!

I want to ask you to take care of my end.

66
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,730
Please forgive me.

67

The souls of your people are saving you.

73
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:08,560
Only the Goblin's bride can pull out that sword.

74
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,610
If the sword is pulled out, you will return to naught and be at peace.

75

How dare you! Who are you to belch such a blasphemous aura out?

Me?

98
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:26,730
I'm asking if the one who called me was you.

99
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,730
I didn't call you, though.

100
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,750
You did.

101
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,280
I really did not.

102
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,960
You called me, for sure. Think about how you called me.

103
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,140
Earnestly?

104
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,410
See, it's you.

[Awkward]

109

I thought this wouldn't work.

110
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,970
Why do it when you thought it wouldn't work?

111
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,860
Mister, are you perhaps a goblin?

112
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,220
What are you?

113
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:14,110
It's a bit embarrassing to say it with my own mouth, but I am the Goblin's bride.

114
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,130
Tell me everything you see in me.

115
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,040
You're tall.

116

And?

117
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,220
Your clothes look expensive.

118
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,780
And?

119
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:30,180
If that's all that you see then you are not the Goblin's bride.
You have no use to a goblin.

120
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,420
Don't have useless hopes and call for me.

121
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:42,210
No, no! Cancel, cancel! No!

122
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,260
You must be reading a book.

123
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:51,750
I am always near a book and I have deep taste in music and art.

124
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:56,180
I'm sorry for disturbing you when you were reading.

125
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,110
That... don't you see anything unique?

126
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:02,670
Something that looks really painful.

127
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,990
Ah... that.

128
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,010
- You see it?
- And I thought it was something.

129
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:08,490
Do you see it? You don't see it, do you?

130
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,520
Do you see it or not?

131
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,680
What happens if I see it?

132
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,100
- Why are you asking? You don't see it anyway.
- Who said I can't see it?

133
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,940
You can't see it.

134

I really can see it. I can really see it.

135
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,280
This sword.

136
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:33,010
Then what am I now?

137
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:37,880
Am I still not the Goblin's bride?

138
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,680
I think you are.

139
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,370
So then, have I now become useful?

140
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,180
Then will you not leave now?

141
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,780
For now.

142
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:56,610
But then... I'm trying to learn more about you.
How did you get stabbed with the sword?

143
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,230
Did you do it yourself? Others?

144
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:01,450
By someone I never thought would do that.

145
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,300
It must be a really painful story.

146
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,670
What about your age? How old exactly are you?

147
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,970
939 years old.

148
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,880
But still... it must be nice to live for long.

149
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:24,980
You don't age, you have a lot of money and you even met your bride.

150
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:29,220
Do you want to live long?
Even if everything flows and you're the only one in place?

151
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,810
I have you.

152
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:37,600
Since you will be there, I think living long won't be so bad.

That girl who flows like flower petals...

160
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,150
She is pulling me with more force than Earth's gravity.

161
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:18,610
My heart continued to swing like a pendulum from sky to ground.

162
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,750
Mister, are you mad?

163
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,440
It was first love.

164
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:37,740
That child is the only one who can end my life,

165
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,850
but she keeps on making me want to live.

166
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:44,310
Isn't that funny?

167
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:49,810
Don't kid yourself. Even without her, you lived fine.

168
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,070
Really?

169
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,450
[The happier he becomes, the worse the pain.]

170
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:03,300
Only the Goblin's bride...

171
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,030
can pull out the sword.

172
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:11,750
When she pulls out the sword, you will become dust and finally be at peace.

173
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,830
I have made my decision.

174
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,850
I should disappear...

175
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,530
before I want to live more,

176
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,240
and before I become happier...

177
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,180
for you...

178
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,880
this is the decision I have to make...

179
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:43,200
ending this life.

180
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,850
Oh, my god!

181
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:53,010
There's always a cool place behind your door.
[The Goblin decides to draw out the sword.]

182
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:58,370
But this must be a very special place. Seeing how you have to get the sword pulled out here.

183
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,170
My beginning and my end.

184
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:03,340
Awesome.

185
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,410
It's the first snow, Mister.

186
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:10,240
Now, let's become pretty.

187
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,210
And your last words?

188
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:15,120
The time I shared together with you

189
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,380
was wonderful. Because the day was good...

190
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,910
because the day was bad...

191
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,540
because the day was good enough...

192
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:32,300
I loved each and every day.

193
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,100
[The Goblin's bride's hands cannot grab the sword]

194
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,140
No... this... why can't I grab it?

195
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,960
I can see it but why can't I pull it out?

196
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,420
Did you put enough strength in your hands?

197
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,490
I got it. I think this is that thing. I know it.

198
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,120
What is it?

199
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,250
A kiss.

200
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:33,830
I was in a hurry, so please understand.

201
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,650
Open your eyes.

202
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,240
This is me with them open...

203
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,320
[One day, Sam Shin Grandma came to see the Goblin.]

204
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,970
Quickly pull the sword. Pull it out

205
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,730
and return to dust.

206
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:00,100
You came out of nowhere and the first thing you're telling me is to die....

207
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,760
You've lived long enough,

208
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:06,310
but that child hasn't. If you don't become dust,

209
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,560
Eun Tak will die.

210
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:15,830
If she fails to execute her task as a tool, the reason for her existence will disappear, because then there won't be a reason to why she should exist.

211
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:20,820
Therefore, if she doesn't pull the sword out, she will keep on facing death.

212
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,700
I'm sure she already has multiple times.

213
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,820
This thing!

214
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,820
Goodbye!

215
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:34,720
Even you almost killed her with your own hands...

216
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,800
♬ When I close my eyes ♬

217

♬ Because my heart keeps on aching, I was hoping to forget ♬

219
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,260
- So...
♬ If it's a dream ♬

220
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,740
- if I pull out that sword,
♬  I wish I could wake up ♬

221
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:12,020
- Mister will die?
♬ Are you really ♬

222
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:19,680
[The harsh fate is that one of them has to die.]
♬ My destiny. You are falling you ♬

223
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:27,210
♬ You are Falling You ♬

224
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:32,750
Did you really love me?

225
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,690
No?

226
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,250
You didn't do even that?

227
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,430
I'm scared. I'm so scared.

228
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,790
I wish I could stay alive...

229
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,090
with you.

230
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:01,640
♬   I’ll certainly find you  ♬

231

♬   I’ll recognize you. Wherever you are  ♬

232
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,660
- I have something to confess...
♬  Whatever you look like   ♬

233
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,470
- I can't pull out the sword for you anymore.
♬   I’ll certainly recognize you   ♬

234
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,890
- Even if you smile, I won't pull it out.
♬   I’ll certainly remember  ♬

235
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:20,090
- In my eyes, Mister is still very pretty.
♬   I’ll remember. I’ll recognize you  ♬

236
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:27,470
It's a new face. It's the one that I told you about before,
who was wandering around for a long time.

237
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:31,810
[However, the misfortune continues]

238
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:35,200
[Goblin Kim Shin's enemy, Park Joong Hun's soul, appears.]

239
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,290
Nice to meet you.

240
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:47,860
You are the Goblin's bride?

241
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,220
I...

242
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,420
met some sort of soul.

243
00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:00,590
Anyhow, I think it was Park Joong Hun.

244
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,650
You avoided me for 900 years...

245
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,250
you shall answer why you appeared before me now.

246
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:18,560
You are laughable for not being able to recognize your enemy beside you.

247
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:22,190
I am here to let you know personally.

248
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,980
You can't kill me with a mere sword.

249
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:38,080
Do you know who that Grim Reaper beside you is?

250
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,510
He is precisely...

251
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,830
Wang Yeo.

252
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:52,530
[The closest person to him, the Grim Reaper, is truly Wang Yeo, the enemy]

253
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:59,790
[After 939 years,]

254

[Kim Shin and Wang Yeo meet.]

255
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,570
General Kim Shin...

256
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,700
is here to meet Your Highness.

257
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,020
In the end...

258
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,590
am I him?

259
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:29,330
I remember that memory every moment of every day.

260
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,860
But since you have no memory,

261
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:37,390
it must be comfortable for you. What must I do?

262
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,290
What must I do with him?

263
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,950
Listen carefully. I will be calling in a moment.
[The Goblin found a way to get rid of Park Joong Hun]

264
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:54,100
-Then you should summon me right away.
- That's a piece of gum. (easy)

265
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:07,760
♬   How can I get over you   ♬

266
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:16,820
♬   Why do we have to be apart?  ♬

267
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,780
I'll come back.

268
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:28,980
[A sudden appearance in front of him]

269
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,880
So should we go to our last war?

270
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,520
How will you know where I will be going?

271
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:55,780
Don't be resentful. This is your fate.

272
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:08,650
[Eun Tak gets possessed]

273
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:11,790
You will die by my hands.

274
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:15,460
Park Joong Hun. Park Joong Hun.

275
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,790
Park Joong Hunn!

276
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:45,130
So I go like this.

277
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:49,770
However, it is not for naught since I killed you again.

278
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:53,200
In the end...

279
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:57,030
it is destruction.

280
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,120
No! No!

281
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,750
Meeting you in my life...

282
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,840
[Meeting you was my life's reward.]

283
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,090
Was a reward...

284
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,670
I don't want this.

285
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:32,590
Please.

286
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:53,090
[In the end the Goblin ceases to exist]

Your order

292

of heaven is here.

293
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:30,320
Please send it to the dry cleaners.

294
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,000
Now that we see this auspicious hat,
you know who the next character I'm about to introduce is, right?
[The character of the auspicious hat]

295
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,920
That is the Grim Reaper.

296
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,510
What a dignified character, huh? At the end of life...

297
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:46,020
Somewhere between the boundary of life and death, he meets countless souls

298
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,360
and erases their memories.

299
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,490
If you can count oblivion as God's kind consideration...

300
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:54,690
However during this time he is living having forgotten his memories.

301
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:59,260
Before those memories are awakened by a ring.

302
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,650
How much is this?

303
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:21,410
[Ring]

304
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,720
Over there... Over there.

305
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,900
Hello? 911? We're at the intersection at Yuksam Station.

306
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,050
Why am I there?

307
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:49,700
Hwang Mi Young, 25 years old.
[The Grim Reaper's day begins as he welcomes the dead]

308
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:55,820
Year of Gaechoong, April, day Eulsa, born on the fourth hour.
Cause of death: suffocation.

309
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:59,010
[Sending off another dead soul serving a tea of oblivion]

310
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:02,680
Drink it.  It will make you forget this life's memories.

311
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:07,270
- If I don't drink it?
- If you don't drink it, you will end up regretting it.

312
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:22,160
Sunbae, they say that if you commit a really big sin
in your previous life you become a Grim Reaper.

313
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,170
What kind of sin and how serious do you think it was?

314
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:30,300
I'm sure it's the will of God. It's just that, returning the memory that one lost...

315
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,410
I'm just curious as to what the will of God is in that.

I signed the contract.
[In the meantime, the mysterious arrangement of living with the Goblin begins]

I hope it wasn't an important document.

I'm sure you know very well what a contract with the Grim Reaper means.

Not your name, a man's name that women like.

342

If it's a name that women like, typically there are these three names.

I know. I've never traveled overseas before.
[10 years later]

636
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,000
That's what I mean. What do you mean going overseas at 9 o'clock?

637
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,660
When I was 29 years old, I didn't even go out to the market in front of the house.

638
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:33,660

There are some curious factors that come up while watching the Goblin.

643
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:46,720
This is a love story and a melodrama.

644
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:50,520
Why do we look back to our lives while watching the drama...

645
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,890
and contemplate our lives for the future?
[The drama, Goblin, makes us look back at our lives]

646
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:58,230
That's probably because the lines make us question continuously about life and death.

647
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:01,290
Beautiful and memorable lines.
[Memorable lines that are only found in Goblin]

648

Among the many...

649
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:06,970
I think it's what Deok Hwa, whom I look after, has said that's beautiful.

650

Grandma, you don't age at all.

655
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:45,380
Could you look after my Eun Tak here and there?

656
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:47,280
Why would I look after your daughter?

657
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,320
Give her some leftover cabbage and spinach.

658
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:54,010
You should've died together then. Why is she living longer?

But... you shouldn't have been born...

663
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:28,580
- Go. Leave this child alone.
- Grandma!

664
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:32,240
Is this child in your book?

665
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:36,570
If you have a book with her name in it, bring it to me.

666

See you again, kiddo.

But why are you telling me these things?

669
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:56,910
Because you're pretty.

670

When I created you...

671
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:06,810
