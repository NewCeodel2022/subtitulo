FOR Eun-ji

9
00:01:15,794 --> 00:01:17,094
Who are you?

10
00:01:17,712 --> 00:01:19,172
Who the fuck are you?

11
00:01:22,298 --> 00:01:23,588
Who?

12
00:01:46,043 --> 00:01:47,343
Who are you?

13
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:40,009
Eh?

14
00:04:40,917 --> 00:04:42,467
Did you come alone?

15
00:04:43,174 --> 00:04:44,884
crazy bitch!

16
00:05:11,926 --> 00:05:13,296
Bitch!

17
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:20,758
Hands up! We will shoot!

18
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,341
Stop! Stay there!

19
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:31,969
THE VILLAIN

Subrip by DanDee Translation By_MrAlbert17

21
00:08:38,047 --> 00:08:41,717
Park and his organization, whom we have been following,

22
00:08:42,003 --> 00:08:43,833
they were all eliminated by this woman.

23
00:08:45,001 --> 00:08:46,301
Look!

24
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:47,879
Who is he?

25
00:08:48,088 --> 00:08:50,168
We are still identifying it,

26
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:54,294
but luckily, he was only there for the meth.

27
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,130
Meta?

28
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:00,258
Which means he took it without knowing anything.

29
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:04,465
So what is the relationship between the girl and him?

30
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,000
We are currently investigating.

31
00:09:09,505 --> 00:09:11,835
Secure your hard drive no matter what!

32
00:09:12,003 --> 00:09:14,963
If that leaks out, it'll be a bloodbath!

33
00:09:16,798 --> 00:09:19,378
And that girl...

34
00:09:19,756 --> 00:09:21,756
She could be of great help.

35
00:09:23,632 --> 00:09:25,132
No?

36
00:11:45,998 --> 00:11:48,088
Sook-hee, wake up!

37
00:11:48,296 --> 00:11:50,756
Sook-hee! Comes back!

38
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:29,506
Hey! Stop!

39
00:12:56,836 --> 00:12:59,046
Hey, newbie! Stop right there!

40
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,338
Is she the new recruit?

41
00:13:17,085 --> 00:13:18,375
His spirit is good.

42
00:13:18,504 --> 00:13:20,464
You were also like her.

43
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,960
- Untamable. - Hey! Easy, okay?

44
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:27,917
You will leave on time!

45
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,415
It's getting interesting, don't try to stop it.

46
00:13:32,671 --> 00:13:33,961
Take it easy!

47
00:13:34,288 --> 00:13:35,878
You can't get out anyway!

48
00:13:35,996 --> 00:13:37,506
Do something!

49
00:13:44,289 --> 00:13:45,589
Open the door!

50
00:13:50,752 --> 00:13:52,042
Be!

51
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,379
Or not to be!

52
00:13:56,746 --> 00:13:59,966
That bitch is also questionable.

53
00:14:14,877 --> 00:14:17,127
Where is the exit?

54
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:26,879
I know, I'll go with you!

55
00:14:33,669 --> 00:14:35,499
This way, over here!

56
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,790
What is this place? Answer to me!

57
00:14:55,626 --> 00:14:58,256
There is no time for that, you have to jump!

58
00:15:00,921 --> 00:15:01,921
That?

59
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,920
Or you can die here.

60
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:20,122
There she is! Stop!

61
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:35,957
Mister.

62
00:15:36,455 --> 00:15:39,755
Chief's charisma is something of an astonishment nowadays.

63
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:41,752
Was she released from prison?

64
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,920
She took a whole gang by herself.

65
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:46,877
Will one of us be assigned to her?

66
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:51,254
Even if it comes with a promotion,

67
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,750
I can't live with her

68
00:15:52,789 --> 00:15:54,089
Does it come with an upgrade?

69
00:15:54,207 --> 00:15:56,297
Damn, look at you.

70
00:15:56,834 --> 00:15:59,254
Will you get a promotion and be our boss?

71
00:15:59,411 --> 00:16:00,751
Are you up to it?

72
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:03,670
Well, I'm good enough to keep company.

73
00:16:03,877 --> 00:16:05,547
listen to this idiot

74
00:16:06,415 --> 00:16:09,295
Being in a relationship and getting a promotion is a win-win.

75
00:16:09,871 --> 00:16:12,081
They don't dole out those assignments freely.

76
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:15,338
There have been many who died trying.

77
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,205
She's here.

78
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:20,792
She is cute.

79
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,920
She really is...

80
00:16:23,578 --> 00:16:25,378
Plastic surgery went well.

81
00:16:25,586 --> 00:16:27,876
Maybe it was good to start with.

82
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:40,624
UNIDENTIFIED CHINESE-KOREAN MURDERER COMMITS SUICIDE.

83
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,670
For now, you don't exist.

84
00:16:53,207 --> 00:16:55,627
But we can revive you

85
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:57,915
if you choose to join our family.

86
00:16:58,962 --> 00:17:03,042
I don't want to live, you should have killed me.

87
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:08,753
We have!

88
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,210
kill you?

89
00:17:12,828 --> 00:17:14,668
You can't die.

90
00:17:17,542 --> 00:17:19,292
You have a new family.

91
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:23,839
Do you think your baby wants to die too?

92
00:17:26,873 --> 00:17:28,163
Lives...

93
00:17:28,332 --> 00:17:30,082
Just for your baby.

94
00:17:45,545 --> 00:17:47,295
What do you want of me?

95
00:17:48,542 --> 00:17:50,162
To live a normal life.

96
00:17:52,168 --> 00:17:53,458
A normal life?

97
00:17:54,335 --> 00:17:55,835
Give us 10 years

98
00:17:56,334 --> 00:17:59,214
then you will earn pension and freedom

99
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,370
for the rest of your life.

100
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:08,047
First, take a personality test and discover a vocation.

101
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:11,621
You will become a sleeper cell and carry out missions.

102
00:18:13,876 --> 00:18:15,166
One more time...

103
00:18:26,624 --> 00:18:28,964
Wow, looks good!

104
00:18:29,161 --> 00:18:30,461
Can I try?

105
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,540
It's strange?

106
00:18:47,082 --> 00:18:48,752
What are you good at exactly?

107
00:18:48,871 --> 00:18:51,211
Do you plan to rot here forever?

108
00:18:52,627 --> 00:18:54,037
Shit!

109
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:56,875
Where is the exit?

110
00:18:57,162 --> 00:19:00,122
Tell me, before I kill every one of you!

111
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:01,709
¡Ve!

112
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:05,586
Come on! You can carry me?

113
00:19:05,993 --> 00:19:07,583
I know where the exit is!

114
00:19:07,702 --> 00:19:09,002
Guide me!

115
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,371
follow me!

116
00:19:13,995 --> 00:19:17,085
Why are you using the wrong dialect?

117
00:19:17,621 --> 00:19:19,161
She is useless.

118
00:19:22,826 --> 00:19:24,126
And you too.

119
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:29,374
With that pretty face, how about acting?

120
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,170
You killed an innocent man

121
00:19:32,537 --> 00:19:35,167
and even children, who barely lived!

122
00:19:35,704 --> 00:19:37,584
The scariest thing in the world is

123
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,871
look at a corpse that your hands killed.

124
00:19:41,418 --> 00:19:42,708
This hand!

125
00:19:43,626 --> 00:19:46,166
The stains that won't go away!

126
00:19:47,292 --> 00:19:50,542
Even after removing the meat, they remain!

127
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:53,746
Go away!

128
00:19:54,954 --> 00:19:56,414
Smell of blood...

129
00:19:56,832 --> 00:19:58,122
Yeah,

130
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:02,880
dip this hand and wash it.

131
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:08,914
Flowing water can filter anything in the world.

132
00:20:11,457 --> 00:20:14,707
Rio, will you wash my hands?

133
00:20:15,872 --> 00:20:18,252
and will you cleanse my body?

134
00:20:37,452 --> 00:20:38,832
Eun-hye,

135
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:41,829
I'll protect you.

136
00:21:00,538 --> 00:21:02,168
Alright.

137
00:21:02,826 --> 00:21:04,126
Don't worry!

138
00:21:08,909 --> 00:21:10,209
Here you have.

139
00:21:10,248 --> 00:21:11,538
Don't worry!

140
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,621
Nice!

141
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,460
Good job.

142
00:21:36,831 --> 00:21:37,661
Stop!

143
00:21:37,701 --> 00:21:39,291
Stop, you'll kill her!

144
00:21:39,409 --> 00:21:40,459
Kim-sun!

145
00:21:40,488 --> 00:21:42,668
- Good! Good! - Come on!

146
00:21:43,165 --> 00:21:45,415
You've seen blood, that's enough.

147
00:21:45,582 --> 00:21:47,292
You will kill her.

148
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,000
Yanbiana.

149
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,419
I heard you're good with a sword.

150
00:21:50,747 --> 00:21:53,837
For the newborn, let's train.

151
00:21:58,459 --> 00:21:59,789
For you little one!

152
00:22:11,745 --> 00:22:13,035
What the hell?

153
00:22:18,579 --> 00:22:19,869
I'm so scared.

154
00:22:20,327 --> 00:22:23,457
Maybe she really wants to leave.

155
00:22:24,372 --> 00:22:27,332
Kim-sun! Let's fuck too!

156
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:01,248
Sook-hee is no joke.

157
00:23:01,456 --> 00:23:03,286
Can you handle it?

158
00:23:03,493 --> 00:23:06,333
Hyun-soo is the only viable option for her.

159
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,870
- Shut up!. - I'm sorry.

160
00:23:09,537 --> 00:23:13,337
Happy Birthday!

161
00:23:13,873 --> 00:23:17,293
Happy Birthday!

162
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:21,079
Happy birthday, dear Eun-hye!

163
00:23:21,415 --> 00:23:23,875
Happy Birthday!

164
00:23:33,243 --> 00:23:34,533
Thank you.

165
00:23:35,542 --> 00:23:38,872
You can't let your baby live a life like yours.

166
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,250
This tattoo...

167
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:52,458
You won't believe how much I loved it.

168
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:59,160
Now I have become someone like you.

169
00:23:59,707 --> 00:24:01,747
You're not going to tell me

170
00:24:02,704 --> 00:24:04,744
who killed your father?

171
00:24:05,951 --> 00:24:08,961
I'm going to kill him myself, I swear.

172
00:24:09,786 --> 00:24:12,576
That's the only reason I'm still alive.

173
00:24:21,164 --> 00:24:22,534
Sook-hee!

174
00:24:23,073 --> 00:24:24,953
Do not do it! Please!

175
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,000
Sook-hee!

176
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:28,459
Everything is my fault!

177
00:24:28,747 --> 00:24:31,457
Stay behind! Please! Sook-hee! Sook-hee!

178
00:24:44,243 --> 00:24:46,203
I told you to stay behind!

179
00:25:07,369 --> 00:25:11,419
Honey, I feel terrible.

180
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:15,454
I wasn't the one who killed your father.

181
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:21,327
What do you mean?

182
00:25:24,332 --> 00:25:27,622
We were like brothers

183
00:25:28,207 --> 00:25:31,077
I couldn't do it with my own hands.

184
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,040
Check out.

185
00:28:07,117 --> 00:28:08,407
start!

186
00:28:16,237 --> 00:28:18,577
Do you still want to live?

187
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:21,455
So kill the girl before she kills you.

188
00:28:21,872 --> 00:28:23,702
That is the only way for you to live.

189
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,120
Do you expect me to believe that?

190
00:28:30,743 --> 00:28:32,033
start!

191
00:29:20,662 --> 00:29:22,782
You died for the first time.

192
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:27,959
Consider yourself dead and live for me.

193
00:29:47,326 --> 00:29:49,076
Take it, $50 each.

194
00:29:49,284 --> 00:29:53,204
That stupid bitch, all her training is lost.

195
00:29:55,368 --> 00:29:56,578
Where is my wallet?

196
00:29:56,607 --> 00:29:57,867
Wait.

197
00:29:57,905 --> 00:29:59,155
What is this?

198
00:29:59,194 --> 00:30:02,374
Sook-hee's favorite color, food, sleeping habits!

199
00:30:02,491 --> 00:30:03,661
Leave that! Leave that!

200
00:30:03,689 --> 00:30:04,949
Number of bathroom visits

201
00:30:04,988 --> 00:30:06,288
Look at this guy.

202
00:30:06,447 --> 00:30:08,077
Working for that promotion, huh?

203
00:30:08,205 --> 00:30:12,165
I hope you don't get killed on your first mission.

204
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,910
Why did you say that? That's bad luck.

205
00:30:15,327 --> 00:30:18,707
We're kidding, don't tie your panties in a knot.

206
00:30:19,404 --> 00:30:20,704
Don't get angry!

207
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:22,242
Do you feel something for her?

208
00:30:22,371 --> 00:30:24,791
No, it's all about promotion.

209
00:30:41,321 --> 00:30:42,621
We are here.

210
00:30:58,155 --> 00:30:59,995
This is your first mission.

211
00:31:00,782 --> 00:31:02,322
If you succeed, you exit.

212
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:04,369
Who is the target?

213
00:31:05,407 --> 00:31:07,787
When I receive orders, I assign them.

214
00:31:08,454 --> 00:31:10,114
And you kill.

215
00:31:10,532 --> 00:31:14,702
Tell me if you're not ready, others are eager to go.

216
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:11,033
Sook-hee, don't go out.

217
00:33:20,781 --> 00:33:22,621
Is this what you want?

218
00:33:23,618 --> 00:33:24,908
Take it.

219
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:22,370
Boss!

220
00:37:56,692 --> 00:37:58,992
Do you know the White Oval that has been stolen?

221
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:00,449
White Oval?

222
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,158
That's all.

223
00:38:04,614 --> 00:38:05,944
It's a secret.

224
00:38:12,985 --> 00:38:14,575
My baby are you up?

225
00:38:17,401 --> 00:38:19,611
Baby, isn't that pretty?

226
00:38:20,318 --> 00:38:21,488
What is this?

227
00:38:21,527 --> 00:38:25,117
When you get married, this will be my gift to you.

228
00:38:25,323 --> 00:38:27,493
I'm so jealous!

229
00:38:32,026 --> 00:38:33,366
Shit!

230
00:38:33,695 --> 00:38:35,365
Where did you hide it?

231
00:38:36,531 --> 00:38:40,571
I should have asked him before he killed him.

232
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:50,529
Where could it be?

233
00:38:51,815 --> 00:38:54,575
Where...

234
00:38:56,742 --> 00:38:59,362
Let me think...

235
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:07,194
I heard you recently scored a big one.

236
00:39:07,361 --> 00:39:10,571
Whore whore! Shut your damn mouth!

237
00:39:11,277 --> 00:39:14,327
If that were true, I wouldn't be in this hell!

238
00:39:14,943 --> 00:39:18,203
Why do you always ask for more money?

239
00:39:22,525 --> 00:39:23,905
Where are you going?

240
00:39:24,114 --> 00:39:25,364
Sook-hee!

241
00:39:25,393 --> 00:39:27,243
Sook-hee! Sook-hee!

242
00:39:27,649 --> 00:39:29,489
Bitch! Stop!

243
00:39:29,817 --> 00:39:31,157
Come here!

244
00:39:35,992 --> 00:39:37,652
Damn bitch!

245
00:40:25,482 --> 00:40:26,782
Who sent you?

246
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:29,910
How much did he pay you? I will pay 5 times!

247
00:40:30,067 --> 00:40:32,067
No, 10 times!

248
00:41:13,403 --> 00:41:14,693
One!

249
00:41:14,862 --> 00:41:16,152
Two!

250
00:41:16,191 --> 00:41:18,071
First 5 reach HQ!

251
00:41:18,858 --> 00:41:20,158
Run faster!

252
00:41:21,066 --> 00:41:22,406
Sook-hee!

253
00:41:25,651 --> 00:41:28,031
Were you going to leave without saying goodbye?

254
00:41:28,608 --> 00:41:30,358
I will be discharged soon

255
00:41:31,025 --> 00:41:32,575
So I'll go find you.

256
00:41:32,904 --> 00:41:37,994
You'll see her if she doesn't die before she leaves.

257
00:41:43,902 --> 00:41:46,532
When you get out, call me.

258
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,449
It's so melodramatic.

259
00:42:08,068 --> 00:42:10,568
It is a document about your new identity.

260
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,405
Memorize it as if your life depended on it.

261
00:42:20,565 --> 00:42:21,865
What is this?

262
00:42:22,154 --> 00:42:25,614
Still in a home, a frame is a must.

263
00:42:50,155 --> 00:42:51,445
Very sorry.

264
00:42:52,363 --> 00:42:53,653
Eun-hye, are you alright?

265
00:42:54,191 --> 00:42:55,491
were you scared Were they scared?

266
00:43:00,065 --> 00:43:01,985
Are you going to move today?

267
00:43:03,023 --> 00:43:04,323
Yeah.

268
00:43:04,532 --> 00:43:07,952
With the increase in the house deposit, I looked everywhere,

269
00:43:08,607 --> 00:43:09,907
and i ended up here...

270
00:43:09,936 --> 00:43:12,986
But I'm not saying it's a bad neighborhood.

271
00:43:13,193 --> 00:43:16,193
It's near a mountain, fresh air,

272
00:43:17,149 --> 00:43:19,489
and even great people too.

273
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:26,900
That is cute

274
00:43:27,108 --> 00:43:28,568
Who gave it to you?

275
00:43:29,986 --> 00:43:33,236
Honey, would you like some candy?

276
00:43:40,774 --> 00:43:43,904
Eun-hye, I told you not to accept things from strangers.

277
00:43:44,191 --> 00:43:45,741
It is expensive candy.

278
00:43:46,108 --> 00:43:47,738
Does not contain much sugar

279
00:43:49,275 --> 00:43:50,565
You can have it.

280
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:51,444
Comételo.

281
00:43:51,473 --> 00:43:52,733
Let's go.

282
00:44:00,274 --> 00:44:01,864
Honey, stay on this side.

283
00:44:02,192 --> 00:44:03,482
Here.

284
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:08,648
That?

285
00:44:13,981 --> 00:44:15,361
My home...

286
00:44:17,647 --> 00:44:19,107
I live here.

287
00:44:27,607 --> 00:44:29,607
Are you at #407?

288
00:44:31,943 --> 00:44:33,733
We are neighbors?

289
00:44:34,191 --> 00:44:36,071
Arriving the same day too?

290
00:44:37,318 --> 00:44:40,988
Are you moving without your husband?

291
00:44:41,313 --> 00:44:42,903
are you divorced

292
00:44:43,521 --> 00:44:45,111
Business trip abroad.

293
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:48,319
Business trip? On moving day?

294
00:44:48,646 --> 00:44:50,366
That is not right!

295
00:44:50,773 --> 00:44:52,363
So why are you lonely?

296
00:44:53,071 --> 00:44:55,821
My wife passed away a few years ago.

297
00:44:58,026 --> 00:45:00,156
It's okay, you didn't do it on purpose.

298
00:45:01,063 --> 00:45:02,363
I'm sorry.

299
00:45:03,191 --> 00:45:04,941
Let's go inside.

300
00:45:18,276 --> 00:45:19,566
One moment!

301
00:45:19,605 --> 00:45:20,775
I?

302
00:45:20,813 --> 00:45:22,073
¿Pizza?

303
00:45:22,772 --> 00:45:24,072
Yeah.

304
00:45:28,356 --> 00:45:29,656
Yeah?

305
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,198
What are you doing?

306
00:45:37,227 --> 00:45:38,607
I paid for you.

307
00:45:38,985 --> 00:45:39,815
Because?

308
00:45:39,854 --> 00:45:41,984
The pizza tastes very good

309
00:45:42,112 --> 00:45:44,442
but it is not nutritious for children.

310
00:45:44,729 --> 00:45:49,529
So I was thinking of making boiled chicken,

311
00:45:49,774 --> 00:45:51,314
if you like chicken...

312
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:53,072
You like chicken?

313
00:45:54,479 --> 00:45:56,279
Well, that wasn't so bad.

314
00:45:56,567 --> 00:45:57,987
We are almost friends.

315
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:04,230
That?

316
00:46:04,609 --> 00:46:06,819
Chief, I need a background check.

317
00:46:07,147 --> 00:46:08,567
Background Check?

318
00:46:09,025 --> 00:46:11,945
There is a man next door, something is wrong.

319
00:46:12,821 --> 00:46:15,281
Okay, I'll look into it.

320
00:46:19,315 --> 00:46:20,655
Jung Hyun-soo

321
00:46:21,482 --> 00:46:22,862
Chief, how are you?

322
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:25,070
Doesn't it look like she wants something from me?

323
00:46:25,318 --> 00:46:27,898
She asked for your background check.

324
00:46:28,905 --> 00:46:30,485
She did what?

325
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:34,282
It's because you were too direct.

326
00:46:35,068 --> 00:46:36,608
This is field work

327
00:46:36,816 --> 00:46:38,196
But she's at my door.

328
00:46:38,355 --> 00:46:41,565
Don't kid around with the background check.

329
00:46:45,738 --> 00:46:47,028
Here you have.

330
00:46:49,603 --> 00:46:51,363
Why do you have this?

331
00:46:51,731 --> 00:46:54,611
Are you from Yanbian?

332
00:46:55,568 --> 00:46:59,028
She was Korean-Chinese. How did you know?

333
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,232
Nothing.

334
00:47:03,149 --> 00:47:05,439
We're neighbors,

335
00:47:05,777 --> 00:47:07,607
can i get your name

336
00:47:10,104 --> 00:47:12,024
Yeon-soo, Chae Yeon-soo.

337
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:14,280
I too am a 'soo'.

338
00:47:14,439 --> 00:47:15,739
Sorry?

339
00:47:15,777 --> 00:47:17,567
Hyun-soo, Jung Hyun-soo.

340
00:47:18,195 --> 00:47:20,195
Chae Yeon-soo, Jung Hyun-soo.

341
00:47:21,112 --> 00:47:24,232
You're Yeon-soo, I'm Hyun-soo!

342
00:47:24,399 --> 00:47:26,239
Neighbors!

343
00:47:31,062 --> 00:47:33,732
How's the chicken for dinner?

344
00:47:38,734 --> 00:47:42,484
Jung Hyun-soo, 33 years old,

345
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:46,110
works at Daesung Corp., development team,

346
00:47:47,066 --> 00:47:48,856
a widower of 3 years.

347
00:47:49,154 --> 00:47:50,654
Cause of death?

348
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:53,480
Robbery, murder.

349
00:47:54,028 --> 00:47:55,108
That?

350
00:47:55,137 --> 00:47:57,607
She was pregnant at the time.

351
00:47:57,814 --> 00:48:00,774
It took 3 years and started working recently,

352
00:48:01,191 --> 00:48:04,071
he sold his house and moved there.

353
00:48:12,231 --> 00:48:14,531
Does this go to Hyehwa station?

354
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:16,398
That's what it says.

355
00:48:16,737 --> 00:48:18,027
So wait.

356
00:48:19,523 --> 00:48:21,313
I left my wallet at home...

357
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:23,651
Just turn up, I won't charge you!

358
00:48:23,779 --> 00:48:24,939
Free?

359
00:48:24,978 --> 00:48:28,198
I need to buy lunch later too...

360
00:48:28,355 --> 00:48:30,275
And take a bus back home.

361
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:31,861
I should go home.

362
00:48:31,890 --> 00:48:33,860
Can't even borrow money at work?

363
00:48:34,028 --> 00:48:35,648
No, I'm a loner.

364
00:48:43,398 --> 00:48:44,728
Bye bye.

365
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,360
- Say goodbye to mom. - Bye, Mom.

366
00:49:14,358 --> 00:49:15,738
Rock Paper Scissors!

367
00:49:53,228 --> 00:49:54,528
Hyun-soo.

368
00:49:56,855 --> 00:49:58,775
did you wait for me

369
00:50:00,441 --> 00:50:01,731
I like it...

370
00:50:01,859 --> 00:50:03,149
That?

371
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:06,527
I like to wait

372
00:50:13,399 --> 00:50:14,859
You...

373
00:50:16,395 --> 00:50:18,355
do you want to go with me?

374
00:50:20,111 --> 00:50:21,771
Wait, are you...

375
00:50:22,439 --> 00:50:25,439
proposing a date?

376
00:50:25,936 --> 00:50:29,446
But you're married, you really shouldn't.

377
00:50:29,771 --> 00:50:31,151
At the moment,

378
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,770
I'm in a play.

379
00:50:35,436 --> 00:50:37,276
Are you an actress?

380
00:50:37,644 --> 00:50:40,234
No wonder, you're so pretty.

381
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,730
i am the star

382
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:44,987
Mother!

383
00:50:45,146 --> 00:50:46,486
My princess!

384
00:50:46,814 --> 00:50:48,854
How did you know it was coming?

385
00:50:49,102 --> 00:50:52,022
She said it was time for her to come home

386
00:50:52,399 --> 00:50:53,689
she was right.

387
00:50:53,817 --> 00:50:56,697
Mom and Mr., are they together?

388
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:22,070
Cobalt.

389
00:51:35,565 --> 00:51:39,815
After finding out that you're alive, I couldn't do anything.

390
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:45,240
You haven't changed anything yet.

391
00:51:46,983 --> 00:51:51,573
I can't get it out of my head, your performance.

392
00:51:52,648 --> 00:51:53,898
It was weird?

393
00:51:53,936 --> 00:51:57,816
No way! It was really good.

394
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:02,020
I feel like I become a new person,

395
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:04,278
when i'm on stage

396
00:52:12,267 --> 00:52:14,027
That tie looks good on you

397
00:52:14,145 --> 00:52:15,605
Um, si?

398
00:52:16,354 --> 00:52:18,984
It was a gift from my wife.

399
00:52:20,021 --> 00:52:24,571
My husband has a similar cobalt tie.

400
00:52:25,485 --> 00:52:27,105
It was my gift.

401
00:52:42,647 --> 00:52:44,397
i love this color

402
00:52:45,355 --> 00:52:49,655
I wanted to tie her up myself on our wedding day.

403
00:52:51,438 --> 00:52:53,018
All right, boss.

404
00:52:54,275 --> 00:52:56,525
I got a job in Seoul, so I'm going there.

405
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:58,483
Okay, take care.

406
00:52:59,271 --> 00:53:01,151
Won't you stay for the wedding?

407
00:53:01,309 --> 00:53:03,359
They will be in Seoul for the honeymoon.

408
00:53:03,725 --> 00:53:06,645
I'll head over first and set things up.

409
00:53:43,855 --> 00:53:45,605
Sir, look at that!

410
00:53:57,521 --> 00:53:58,811
You are not going to eat?

411
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:02,979
Let's live a normal life.

412
00:54:09,769 --> 00:54:11,059
Yeah?

413
00:54:12,936 --> 00:54:14,226
That?

414
00:54:15,983 --> 00:54:17,273
I understand.

415
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:21,230
Something wrong?

416
00:54:22,017 --> 00:54:25,317
Chun-mo is in trouble, he goes back to the hotel.

417
00:54:25,564 --> 00:54:26,854
I'm with you.

418
00:54:26,892 --> 00:54:28,562
It's our honeymoon

419
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,570
Listen to me and come back.

420
00:55:00,478 --> 00:55:01,768
Yeah?

421
00:55:02,935 --> 00:55:06,855
Joong-sang told me not to tell you.

422
00:55:07,521 --> 00:55:12,191
We've tracked down your father's real killer,

423
00:55:12,395 --> 00:55:14,315
and he asked me to take care of it.

424
00:55:15,063 --> 00:55:17,733
But when I was taken hostage,

425
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:19,980
He tried to rescue me...

426
00:55:20,109 --> 00:55:21,859
Where are they?

427
00:55:23,436 --> 00:55:24,936
¡Dime!

428
00:55:30,808 --> 00:55:32,728
I had a lot of fun today.

429
00:55:36,982 --> 00:55:38,902
I know it's wrong

430
00:55:40,518 --> 00:55:46,528
But for a second, I wished you weren't married.

431
00:56:02,436 --> 00:56:03,686
¿Sra. Chae?

432
00:56:03,724 --> 00:56:04,854
Yes ma'am?

433
00:56:04,892 --> 00:56:06,312
Eun-hye is asleep

434
00:56:06,521 --> 00:56:09,401
I have a party to prepare, I have to go.

435
00:56:09,648 --> 00:56:13,188
I'm almost there, could you wait a bit?

436
00:56:14,603 --> 00:56:15,893
Well.

437
00:56:16,062 --> 00:56:18,482
Sir, could you stop the taxi?

438
00:56:19,098 --> 00:56:21,108
There is still a way to go.

439
00:56:23,065 --> 00:56:27,735
It would be awkward if your babysitter saw us together again.

440
00:56:31,396 --> 00:56:32,686
Hyun-soo!

441
00:56:32,935 --> 00:56:34,225
Forward.

442
00:57:14,273 --> 00:57:16,143
I have something to tell you.

443
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,020
Honestly,

444
00:57:19,518 --> 00:57:21,568
my husband passed away

445
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:24,984
Already knew.

446
00:57:25,682 --> 00:57:27,442
But how?

447
00:57:28,149 --> 00:57:33,399
You're perfect for acting

448
00:57:34,682 --> 00:57:36,892
but terrible to lie.

449
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:05,482
I'm sorry.

450
00:58:05,511 --> 00:58:07,731
I'm not well.

451
00:58:43,473 --> 00:58:44,813
don't answer

452
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:49,020
Sorry, it's an urgent call.

453
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:57,520
Yeah?

454
00:59:11,315 --> 00:59:13,395
A colleague had an accident,

455
00:59:14,222 --> 00:59:16,482
and he's on his way to the hospital.

456
00:59:18,397 --> 00:59:19,687
Hyun-soo.

457
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:23,855
Could you sleep here just for tonight?

458
00:59:24,181 --> 00:59:26,271
Eun-hye will be alone.

459
00:59:28,059 --> 00:59:30,399
Don't worry, stay calm.

460
00:59:41,895 --> 00:59:43,185
Sook-hee!

461
00:59:44,481 --> 00:59:45,771
My-yeah!

462
00:59:46,729 --> 00:59:48,019
Why are you here?

463
00:59:48,098 --> 00:59:49,398
It is not obvious?

464
00:59:50,725 --> 00:59:52,315
I got my first mission.

465
00:59:52,643 --> 00:59:54,023
Your southern accent is gone.

466
00:59:54,142 --> 00:59:55,022
Of course.

467
00:59:55,051 --> 00:59:57,311
When I graduate, I will live in Seoul.

468
00:59:57,728 --> 01:00:00,058
Seoul must treat you well.

469
01:00:02,603 --> 01:00:04,103
Do you have a man?

470
01:00:04,271 --> 01:00:06,391
OK? Tell me!

471
01:00:06,689 --> 01:00:07,899
Of course not.

472
01:00:07,928 --> 01:00:10,058
You can not lie me.

473
01:00:21,934 --> 01:00:23,104
Hey.

474
01:00:23,131 --> 01:00:24,931
Why the mood so strange?

475
01:00:25,849 --> 01:00:27,389
This is bad.

476
01:00:27,598 --> 01:00:29,018
I will undress you.

477
01:00:29,606 --> 01:00:30,896
OK.

478
01:00:30,935 --> 01:00:33,525
Drinking wasn't the only thing I came here for.

479
01:00:36,229 --> 01:00:37,519
Come here baby.

480
01:00:37,548 --> 01:00:39,268
Let me feel you.

481
01:00:39,856 --> 01:00:41,516
I think I'm drunk.

482
01:00:41,724 --> 01:00:43,394
What are you doing?

483
01:00:44,481 --> 01:00:45,771
One second.

484
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:47,190
Because?

485
01:00:47,219 --> 01:00:48,729
I go to the bathroom...

486
01:00:50,474 --> 01:00:52,394
Come on, hurry up.

487
01:00:53,931 --> 01:00:55,271
Keep going.

488
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:58,189
Take that off, finish undressing.

489
01:01:11,933 --> 01:01:13,683
Did you take my phone?

490
01:01:16,438 --> 01:01:18,558
I'll take it back, let her go.

491
01:01:21,014 --> 01:01:23,974
You must have made a copy.

492
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:25,930
A lady.

493
01:02:07,686 --> 01:02:08,976
Many times!

494
01:02:19,894 --> 01:02:21,814
Min-ju, are you alright?

495
01:02:59,554 --> 01:03:01,434
Take her to the ER!

496
01:03:03,021 --> 01:03:04,851
He lost too much blood!

497
01:03:05,139 --> 01:03:06,689
The flash drive.

498
01:03:08,895 --> 01:03:10,725
- Start transferring. - Yes ma'am.

499
01:03:16,937 --> 01:03:18,227
We can't do it here.

500
01:03:18,395 --> 01:03:19,685
Let's go to the emergency room.

501
01:03:20,223 --> 01:03:21,513
Let's go back.

502
01:03:22,681 --> 01:03:24,931
Min-ju will die! She will die here!

503
01:03:25,058 --> 01:03:26,348
For that reason, it is that...

504
01:03:29,144 --> 01:03:32,474
You should have done your job correctly.

505
01:04:30,302 --> 01:04:31,682
Yeon-soo, are you alright?

506
01:04:49,644 --> 01:04:51,474
vent.

507
01:05:06,686 --> 01:05:08,726
Choi Chun-mo who emerged from this operation,

508
01:05:09,393 --> 01:05:12,223
is known as a mid-level boss

509
01:05:12,770 --> 01:05:15,940
of an organization that kills for hire,

510
01:05:16,136 --> 01:05:19,356
and controls more than 5 medium-sized subsidiaries.

511
01:05:19,683 --> 01:05:21,973
Using data from our hard drive,

512
01:05:22,310 --> 01:05:24,560
Choi became a major player,

513
01:05:24,727 --> 01:05:28,767
and your pawn Sook-hee was recruited to the agency?

514
01:05:29,932 --> 01:05:31,852
Isn't that suspicious?

515
01:05:32,890 --> 01:05:34,180
Wait a minute,

516
01:05:34,307 --> 01:05:36,887
so she has been a double agent?

517
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:41,565
We have put an agent to watch her, and there is no problem.

518
01:05:42,351 --> 01:05:47,901
Choi is someone who eliminated her husband to reach his level.

519
01:05:48,094 --> 01:05:49,894
Enough about his backstory,

520
01:05:50,142 --> 01:05:53,182
We need to catch the puppet master.

521
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:57,099
We have received intelligence that HIN will be contacted.

522
01:05:57,435 --> 01:05:58,725
We'll move then.

523
01:05:58,934 --> 01:06:01,514
Why don't we assign it?

524
01:06:08,594 --> 01:06:11,184
Did you make mom cry?

525
01:06:11,891 --> 01:06:13,521
I don't...

526
01:06:14,058 --> 01:06:16,138
Console.

527
01:06:16,515 --> 01:06:19,015
What does that mean?

528
01:06:19,352 --> 01:06:20,722
consolation is,

529
01:06:20,891 --> 01:06:25,561
that when you cry, I tell you "don't cry".

530
01:06:25,975 --> 01:06:29,055
Can you comfort mom?

531
01:06:29,552 --> 01:06:30,852
What do you mean?

532
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:33,560
when mom cries

533
01:06:35,266 --> 01:06:39,726
tell him, "don't cry, don't cry"

534
01:06:44,098 --> 01:06:45,478
Are you up?

535
01:06:45,766 --> 01:06:47,306
Sit down, the food is getting cold.

536
01:06:47,555 --> 01:06:51,015
I am satisfied and sleepy.

537
01:07:03,559 --> 01:07:05,689
Did she screw you up?

538
01:07:06,055 --> 01:07:07,435
She said that,

539
01:07:08,473 --> 01:07:11,013
I should comfort you every time you cry.

540
01:07:11,890 --> 01:07:13,640
I can do it?

541
01:07:15,386 --> 01:07:18,096
the me you know

542
01:07:19,721 --> 01:07:21,261
not the real me.

543
01:07:22,519 --> 01:07:24,849
That's what I wanted to tell you.

544
01:07:25,556 --> 01:07:26,846
That?

545
01:07:27,394 --> 01:07:31,184
I'm not the person you think you know.

546
01:07:31,889 --> 01:07:33,639
I am a terrible person

547
01:07:34,886 --> 01:07:40,896
But if you're okay with that, I want to be by your side.

548
01:07:45,935 --> 01:07:47,225
No.

549
01:07:48,053 --> 01:07:53,853
If you knew the real me, you'd run away.

550
01:07:55,177 --> 01:07:59,227
It doesn't matter who you are, or what you like,

551
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:04,639
I will never leave your side.

552
01:08:08,642 --> 01:08:11,182
Are you saying you want to get married?

553
01:08:11,889 --> 01:08:13,269
if they kill me,

554
01:08:14,386 --> 01:08:16,686
Eun-hye will be left alone.

555
01:08:25,095 --> 01:08:27,935
I'll reserve the wedding hall and hire some guests.

556
01:08:28,842 --> 01:08:30,142
Sorry?

557
01:08:32,468 --> 01:08:34,348
Will you do it yourself?

558
01:08:35,175 --> 01:08:36,475
Wait.

559
01:08:37,343 --> 01:08:42,473
When you reach adolescence, you will live a normal life.

560
01:08:55,056 --> 01:08:58,516
Hyun-soo, we can get married.

561
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:04,560
You see it? I told you your parents would approve.

562
01:09:07,053 --> 01:09:12,773
Whatever happens, let's trust each other.

563
01:09:15,684 --> 01:09:17,224
Yes, I will do it.

564
01:09:19,181 --> 01:09:21,391
I will trust you from here on out.

565
01:09:23,177 --> 01:09:27,897
Whatever happens, I will trust you.

566
01:09:28,801 --> 01:09:30,471
Fiance.

567
01:10:07,472 --> 01:10:10,602
Looks like you've seen a ghost.

568
01:10:11,558 --> 01:10:13,928
I heard you were working in Japan.

569
01:10:15,305 --> 01:10:16,635
Why are you here?

570
01:10:17,393 --> 01:10:19,893
I heard that you killed Min-ju.

571
01:10:23,426 --> 01:10:25,346
You should have done a better job.

572
01:10:25,684 --> 01:10:28,054
It would have been nice if she was here.

573
01:10:42,097 --> 01:10:45,937
A bride should not frown, smile.

574
01:10:46,343 --> 01:10:49,183
The boss wants me to send a selfie.

575
01:10:50,010 --> 01:10:51,350
Boss..

576
01:10:51,508 --> 01:10:56,688
Speaking of the devil, she's the boss.

577
01:10:59,969 --> 01:11:01,259
Yes, boss.

578
01:11:01,598 --> 01:11:03,138
Pon a Sook-hee.

579
01:11:05,474 --> 01:11:06,764
Reply.

580
01:11:14,265 --> 01:11:15,345
Yeah?

581
01:11:15,384 --> 01:11:17,554
Go to the bathroom immediately.

582
01:11:21,678 --> 01:11:24,098
There are parts of a PSG-1 in the toilet.

583
01:11:40,218 --> 01:11:43,928
Through the fan, in the adjacent building, 4th floor.

584
01:11:58,641 --> 01:12:00,851
Shoot the man with glasses.

585
01:12:42,385 --> 01:12:43,845
Shoot him!

586
01:12:49,429 --> 01:12:50,719
That man,

587
01:12:51,597 --> 01:12:52,597
Who is he?

588
01:12:52,626 --> 01:12:55,516
Don't question the goal.

589
01:12:55,842 --> 01:12:58,052
Miss, the ceremony is about to begin.

590
01:13:42,175 --> 01:13:43,465
Sook-hee!

591
01:13:43,974 --> 01:13:45,264
Sook-hee!

592
01:13:45,551 --> 01:13:46,841
Wait!

593
01:13:47,091 --> 01:13:49,181
You will die if you enter.

594
01:13:49,428 --> 01:13:51,258
He wouldn't have wanted this.

595
01:13:53,804 --> 01:13:55,434
Without him,

596
01:13:56,092 --> 01:13:57,972
I can not continue.

597
01:14:36,969 --> 01:14:38,259
Do not Cry

598
01:14:39,677 --> 01:14:41,307
It's a good day.

599
01:14:51,056 --> 01:14:54,556
How could our dear Sook-hee make this mistake?

600
01:14:54,673 --> 01:14:55,513
cover it up

601
01:14:55,542 --> 01:14:57,142
Finish up and go.

602
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:00,100
Did you bring me here for this?

603
01:15:00,217 --> 01:15:03,347
Take the target she missed.

604
01:15:43,762 --> 01:15:48,012
Doesn't look familiar?

605
01:15:50,676 --> 01:15:52,136
I'm not sure...

606
01:15:52,884 --> 01:15:54,384
Anything unusual about her?

607
01:15:54,971 --> 01:15:56,761
His guests were paid.

608
01:15:56,970 --> 01:15:58,300
Hired guests?

609
01:15:59,717 --> 01:16:02,307
Boss, maybe it's your second marriage.

610
01:16:03,923 --> 01:16:06,803
Maybe for him too.

611
01:16:07,548 --> 01:16:10,048
Both sides used hired hosts.

612
01:16:14,971 --> 01:16:19,801
You haven't changed anything yet.

613
01:16:23,762 --> 01:16:25,052
No.

614
01:16:26,969 --> 01:16:28,469
I have changed.

615
01:16:28,717 --> 01:16:30,557
Please trust me one more time.

616
01:16:31,844 --> 01:16:33,724
I know one thing for sure.

617
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:38,890
We cannot exist in the same space.

618
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:48,050
As long as you're alive

619
01:16:51,095 --> 01:16:52,515
I can not live.

620
01:17:24,172 --> 01:17:25,472
Yeon-soo.

621
01:17:33,382 --> 01:17:35,012
I have to attend to this.

622
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:27,680
Do you recognize me?

623
01:18:29,046 --> 01:18:30,886
Who are you?

624
01:18:33,301 --> 01:18:37,011
You may not recognize me

625
01:18:38,546 --> 01:18:40,636
but I know you very well.

626
01:18:42,712 --> 01:18:47,512
People will soon love you, just like me.

627
01:18:48,256 --> 01:18:50,386
Could you leave me alone?

628
01:19:02,882 --> 01:19:04,422
Does it offend you?

629
01:19:05,380 --> 01:19:07,260
My husband will be back soon.

630
01:19:08,547 --> 01:19:13,307
Didn't you love someone more than your current husband?

631
01:19:16,218 --> 01:19:21,848
You must know a lot about actress Chae Yeon-soo.

632
01:19:22,342 --> 01:19:23,632
Yeah.

633
01:19:24,669 --> 01:19:26,259
And I want to know more.

634
01:19:33,341 --> 01:19:38,931
After losing the love of his life,

635
01:19:42,092 --> 01:19:45,472
she chose the setting to forget it.

636
01:19:46,758 --> 01:19:51,808
But he returns from the dead to the stage.

637
01:19:52,961 --> 01:19:57,551
If she has to kill him in order to live,

638
01:19:59,465 --> 01:20:01,505
what would you do?

639
01:20:05,259 --> 01:20:06,549
Yeah...

640
01:20:08,386 --> 01:20:10,056
that's the case...

641
01:20:16,008 --> 01:20:21,008
it would be the saddest thing in the world

642
01:20:31,802 --> 01:20:33,302
I'm sorry.

643
01:20:36,587 --> 01:20:41,597
I have confused you with a woman I loved.

644
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,630
I will leave you now.

645
01:21:08,085 --> 01:21:10,805
She is very confused after that mission.

646
01:21:10,963 --> 01:21:13,053
Why did he make such a mistake?

647
01:21:13,220 --> 01:21:16,300
He was ordered to kill on his wedding day,

648
01:21:16,637 --> 01:21:19,257
Who wouldn't make that mistake?

649
01:21:19,963 --> 01:21:24,053
Make no mistake, your marriage is your mission.

650
01:21:24,669 --> 01:21:26,009
Who...

651
01:21:27,546 --> 01:21:29,256
was the goal?

652
01:22:05,468 --> 01:22:06,468
That?

653
01:22:06,497 --> 01:22:07,757
Are you OK?

654
01:22:11,251 --> 01:22:12,551
I'm fine.

655
01:22:24,258 --> 01:22:25,548
Listen.

656
01:22:26,586 --> 01:22:28,046
I can not use...

657
01:22:28,464 --> 01:22:30,344
bra with this dress,

658
01:22:31,341 --> 01:22:32,881
did you know

659
01:22:37,884 --> 01:22:40,424
What do you imagine now?

660
01:22:45,047 --> 01:22:46,587
I certainly did.

661
01:23:07,085 --> 01:23:09,635
If you promise to stay with me

662
01:23:10,133 --> 01:23:12,463
I will forget about revenge

663
01:23:13,130 --> 01:23:15,590
and we will live a normal life

664
01:23:17,085 --> 01:23:18,675
Revenge?

665
01:23:20,632 --> 01:23:22,462
It's over?

666
01:23:28,463 --> 01:23:32,513
The one who killed my father was someone else.

667
01:23:35,377 --> 01:23:37,047
Who was?

668
01:23:40,132 --> 01:23:41,802
you found your goal

669
01:23:44,337 --> 01:23:48,887
It was a coincidence. He was a fan of the play.

670
01:23:52,759 --> 01:23:54,049
Coincidence?

671
01:23:54,077 --> 01:23:56,387
Was failing the mission also a coincidence?

672
01:23:57,294 --> 01:24:00,004
Don't forget what you're living for.

673
01:24:00,631 --> 01:24:02,551
Once you forget it

674
01:24:02,919 --> 01:24:07,139
you and your family will be eliminated.

675
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:14,300
Are you threatening me?

676
01:24:16,386 --> 01:24:18,636
No, I'm advising you.

677
01:25:02,418 --> 01:25:03,468
What is it?

678
01:25:03,498 --> 01:25:05,088
from a fan

679
01:25:12,708 --> 01:25:14,128
"Tu mayor fan..."

680
01:25:19,632 --> 01:25:20,922
What is it?

681
01:25:23,758 --> 01:25:24,968
Where are you going?

682
01:25:24,996 --> 01:25:26,336
I am a guest actress.

683
01:25:26,754 --> 01:25:28,254
And also your solver.

684
01:26:13,088 --> 01:26:15,548
He was ordered to kill on his wedding day,

685
01:26:15,716 --> 01:26:18,176
Who wouldn't make that mistake?

686
01:26:18,752 --> 01:26:22,802
Make no mistake, your marriage is your mission.

687
01:26:23,917 --> 01:26:27,007
Who was the target?

688
01:26:30,460 --> 01:26:32,050
"Tu mayor fan..."

689
01:26:35,215 --> 01:26:36,545
A woman

690
01:26:38,292 --> 01:26:40,462
has been sent to kill you.

691
01:26:51,918 --> 01:26:52,798
Do not move!

692
01:26:52,827 --> 01:26:54,257
Not a single step, idiots!

693
01:26:54,376 --> 01:26:55,676
See this?

694
01:26:55,704 --> 01:26:59,214
If I push this, we'll all be dead!

695
01:27:40,549 --> 01:27:43,049
Kim-sun was taken by the target, stay with Sook-hee.

696
01:27:43,167 --> 01:27:45,047
She could be unpredictable.

697
01:27:45,504 --> 01:27:48,294
Is the target your ex-husband?

698
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:50,090
Don't go any deeper!

699
01:27:50,249 --> 01:27:52,299
He must die for her to live.

700
01:27:56,003 --> 01:27:57,543
Trust me, Hyun-soo.

701
01:27:58,381 --> 01:28:00,171
I'm going to Yanbian.

702
01:28:05,673 --> 01:28:07,333
What are you doing here?

703
01:28:08,382 --> 01:28:11,922
My mother is sick.

704
01:28:12,258 --> 01:28:14,338
I better go and take care of her.

705
01:28:23,007 --> 01:28:27,217
Take care of Eun-hye while I'm away.

706
01:28:27,501 --> 01:28:30,211
Call me if anything happens.

707
01:28:33,796 --> 01:28:35,546
I doubt anything is going to happen.

708
01:28:36,463 --> 01:28:40,843
Because you are always taking care of me.

709
01:28:43,256 --> 01:28:45,426
Yeon-soo, I love you.

710
01:29:45,463 --> 01:29:46,883
Sook-hee.

711
01:29:48,380 --> 01:29:49,800
Do you remember her?

712
01:29:57,210 --> 01:29:58,500
Send this.

713
01:30:02,006 --> 01:30:04,336
I wanted you to kill him.

714
01:30:05,622 --> 01:30:06,922
So,

715
01:30:06,951 --> 01:30:09,751
you would have lived happily with your husband and daughter.

716
01:30:10,458 --> 01:30:12,458
Now they are all in danger.

717
01:30:14,874 --> 01:30:17,294
My husband Jung Hyun-soo.

718
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:21,050
The agency's lapdog.

719
01:30:21,876 --> 01:30:24,086
Did you put me down?

720
01:30:24,334 --> 01:30:27,754
When I asked your permission to marry him!

721
01:30:30,548 --> 01:30:32,298
Watch your mouth.

722
01:30:37,790 --> 01:30:40,380
"Midnight Hostage Exchange, Dongjin Compound"

723
01:30:40,497 --> 01:30:41,837
Jung Hyun-soo

724
01:30:45,672 --> 01:30:47,082
How did it go?

725
01:30:48,089 --> 01:30:50,049
I will inform you tomorrow.

726
01:30:51,336 --> 01:30:52,626
Boss,

727
01:30:53,964 --> 01:30:57,134
I can't communicate with Sook-hee, is there something wrong?

728
01:30:59,418 --> 01:31:01,338
She is sick, she is in the hospital.

729
01:31:01,505 --> 01:31:03,165
Where is she?

730
01:31:04,043 --> 01:31:05,503
It's bad?

731
01:31:07,789 --> 01:31:09,249
Take care of Eun-hye.

732
01:31:09,418 --> 01:31:11,008
Come back home.

733
01:31:19,878 --> 01:31:21,418
Dad is here!

734
01:31:24,084 --> 01:31:25,584
¡Papi!

735
01:31:28,749 --> 01:31:30,379
How is my baby?

736
01:31:31,626 --> 01:31:33,336
Did you miss me?

737
01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:49,040
Alright? Mister?

738
01:32:21,086 --> 01:32:22,126
Sook-hee, are you alright?

739
01:32:22,165 --> 01:32:23,415
Mister!

740
01:32:23,713 --> 01:32:26,463
I have to rescue my daughter.

741
01:32:28,039 --> 01:32:29,839
Okay, we have to move.

742
01:32:35,172 --> 01:32:37,712
I'll go find her.

743
01:32:38,498 --> 01:32:41,958
Just in case, take this with you.

744
01:33:23,872 --> 01:33:25,422
Eun-hye, wake up.

745
01:33:26,919 --> 01:33:28,209
Honey, please.

746
01:33:28,788 --> 01:33:30,298
Open your eyes.

747
01:33:33,873 --> 01:33:35,173
Baby...

748
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:37,380
Eun-hye!

749
01:33:39,127 --> 01:33:40,417
Sook-hee...

750
01:33:43,543 --> 01:33:44,833
Who did this?

751
01:33:45,541 --> 01:33:46,831
Who?

752
01:33:49,546 --> 01:33:50,956
¡Dime!

753
01:35:19,087 --> 01:35:21,797
So this is what you meant

754
01:35:23,082 --> 01:35:24,832
with cleaning ourselves?

755
01:35:25,630 --> 01:35:28,340
You still only believe what you see.

756
01:35:28,707 --> 01:35:32,087
It wasn't us, don't you understand?

757
01:35:32,872 --> 01:35:34,372
No more lies!

758
01:35:36,578 --> 01:35:38,498
If it wasn't you

759
01:35:39,835 --> 01:35:42,545
Who else would do this?

760
01:35:56,169 --> 01:35:57,959
Dad, hurry up!

761
01:35:58,336 --> 01:35:59,626
You are going to the bathroom?

762
01:36:00,374 --> 01:36:02,164
Come on!

763
01:36:10,454 --> 01:36:11,754
Eun-hye.

764
01:36:12,162 --> 01:36:13,412
Alright.

765
01:36:13,450 --> 01:36:15,420
Are you afraid?

766
01:36:16,418 --> 01:36:19,458
So how is our reputation in Yanbian?

767
01:36:21,164 --> 01:36:23,664
Did you really have to do this to Sook-hee?

768
01:36:24,121 --> 01:36:25,421
And?

769
01:36:25,959 --> 01:36:29,459
Do you see her take revenge on her father's murderer?

770
01:36:29,795 --> 01:36:32,125
She loved Lee Joong-sang.

771
01:36:32,912 --> 01:36:35,042
So he married her,

772
01:36:35,579 --> 01:36:37,249
and they even went on their honeymoon.

773
01:36:37,377 --> 01:36:41,627
She should have died then, just as we had planned.

774
01:36:42,502 --> 01:36:45,372
Now we have to kill his daughter too.

775
01:36:45,629 --> 01:36:50,509
She is the daughter of Lee Joong-sang.

776
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:05,540
- Yes Boss. - Lee Joong-sang

777
01:37:06,457 --> 01:37:07,747
Lee Joong-sang!

778
01:37:07,956 --> 01:37:09,206
Yes I understand.

779
01:37:09,245 --> 01:37:10,625
- Yes sir. - Lee Joong-sang

780
01:37:12,042 --> 01:37:15,292
No, sir, it's nothing at all.

781
01:37:15,459 --> 01:37:19,749
Tell him! Eun-hye is her daughter!

782
01:37:21,083 --> 01:37:22,373
Well.

783
01:37:29,085 --> 01:37:34,005
Sook-hee was already pregnant when she came to the agency.

784
01:38:07,626 --> 01:38:08,916
I understand.

785
01:38:37,536 --> 01:38:39,626
He said he will forgive you.

786
01:38:41,252 --> 01:38:42,792
Should I do it?

787
01:38:46,377 --> 01:38:47,747
Ok I will do it.

788
01:38:49,044 --> 01:38:50,834
God, you're fast.

789
01:38:50,952 --> 01:38:52,252
Keep it still.

790
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:54,250
Good.

791
01:38:54,329 --> 01:38:55,629
Let's Play.

792
01:39:22,580 --> 01:39:23,870
¡Papi!

793
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:25,380
¡Papi!

794
01:39:26,456 --> 01:39:27,746
Papi...

795
01:39:27,915 --> 01:39:29,205
Damn...

796
01:39:29,334 --> 01:39:30,624
The gun.

797
01:39:32,041 --> 01:39:33,331
Gun!

798
01:39:37,876 --> 01:39:39,456
It's all set.

799
01:39:41,411 --> 01:39:44,331
So will you forgive me?

800
01:39:55,876 --> 01:39:58,876
Daddy get up!

801
01:39:59,163 --> 01:40:01,793
Dad please!

802
01:40:02,370 --> 01:40:03,920
Yes, I can see her.

803
01:40:25,457 --> 01:40:27,587
Why are you doing me this?

804
01:40:28,165 --> 01:40:29,455
¡Dime!

805
01:40:49,952 --> 01:40:53,462
Killing me won't change anything.

806
01:40:58,663 --> 01:41:03,543
I wish you two had met under different circumstances.

807
01:41:29,453 --> 01:41:30,753
Look.

808
01:41:31,001 --> 01:41:32,291
Boss.

809
01:41:32,620 --> 01:41:35,920
Can we really get married?

810
01:41:36,705 --> 01:41:38,915
Agent Jung, make peace together!

811
01:41:39,122 --> 01:41:41,912
Sook-hee is a woman who could die at any moment.

812
01:41:43,538 --> 01:41:45,498
But I love her.

813
01:41:48,243 --> 01:41:49,543
Sook-hee...

814
01:41:51,410 --> 01:41:55,120
She can't live with blood on her hands forever.

815
01:41:58,453 --> 01:42:01,293
I didn't want you to be like me.

816
01:43:13,117 --> 01:43:14,417
Ceasefire!

817
01:43:18,491 --> 01:43:20,911
Go see.

818
01:44:47,493 --> 01:44:48,993
Boss, we're out of ammo!

819
01:46:01,827 --> 01:46:03,327
Mister.

820
01:46:04,994 --> 01:46:07,244
Even for a moment

821
01:46:10,748 --> 01:46:13,158
did you ever love me

822
01:46:15,413 --> 01:46:17,913
Nothing we say here,

823
01:46:20,947 --> 01:46:22,827
it will change things.

824
01:46:24,534 --> 01:46:26,834
I need to hear it

825
01:46:27,661 --> 01:46:29,741
from your mouth

826
01:46:37,491 --> 01:46:39,121
Sook-hee...

827
01:46:41,997 --> 01:46:43,327
I...

828
01:46:46,162 --> 01:46:48,292
I loved you.

829
01:46:49,949 --> 01:46:54,499
But for killing your father,

830
01:46:56,702 --> 01:46:59,292
I couldn't love you more.

831
01:47:07,741 --> 01:47:10,371
Is that what you wanted to hear?

832
01:47:16,621 --> 01:47:18,991
You want to believe that.

833
01:47:20,578 --> 01:47:23,998
You can choose to live believing that.

834
01:47:32,116 --> 01:47:35,126
How could you do this to me?

835
01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:41,249
I have that privilege.

836
01:47:43,665 --> 01:47:48,295
Because I made you.

837
01:47:52,655 --> 01:47:54,615
Let me teach you.

838
01:47:57,281 --> 01:48:00,001
what did you do to me

839
01:49:30,287 --> 01:49:31,327
Boss!

840
01:49:31,355 --> 01:49:33,745
Boss! The police are on the way!

841
01:49:34,571 --> 01:49:35,951
- Hurry up! - Yes sir!

842
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:37,530
Come on!

843
01:49:38,618 --> 01:49:39,578
Fast!

844
01:49:39,608 --> 01:49:40,868
¡Bajense!

845
01:49:42,155 --> 01:49:43,455
That?

846
01:49:43,993 --> 01:49:44,873
Get down now!

847
01:49:44,903 --> 01:49:46,203
To hell!

848
01:49:46,870 --> 01:49:48,160
Boss, hurry up!

849
01:49:48,288 --> 01:49:49,578
Fast!

850
01:49:53,414 --> 01:49:54,874
I do not arrive yet!

851
01:49:55,032 --> 01:49:56,492
Boss, come on!

852
01:50:00,406 --> 01:50:02,956
Please! Boss!

853
01:50:03,283 --> 01:50:05,623
Boss, come quick!

854
01:50:29,237 --> 01:50:30,537
Are you OK?

855
01:51:40,365 --> 01:51:41,655
What the fuck?

856
01:51:43,742 --> 01:51:45,032
Get rid of her!

857
01:51:49,576 --> 01:51:50,866
Bitch!

858
01:56:49,284 --> 01:56:50,654
Sook-hee...

859
01:56:53,700 --> 01:56:55,820
Why are you shaking?

860
01:56:58,195 --> 01:56:59,785
It is unfortunate.

861
01:57:03,989 --> 01:57:05,909
Do not be afraid

862
01:57:09,533 --> 01:57:11,453

hit me.

864
01:57:19,693 --> 01:57:21,243
We have!

865
01:57:23,199 --> 01:57:24,909

01:57:27,575 --> 01:57:29,865

01:57:34,237 --> 01:57:36,277

01:57:39,652 --> 01:57:45,662
Like the day I killed you.

02:03:28,820 --> 02:03:32,450
