00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,920
THIS FILM IS BASED ON TRUE EVENTS

2
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:14,570
OCTOBER 1979. With the assassination of President Park Chung-hee...

3
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,120
...South Korea's 18-year era of dictatorship ends...

4
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,670
...but in contrast to the people's hope for democracy...

5
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:25,520
...General Chun Doo-hwan leads a military coup and seizes power.

6
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,700
In 1980, outraged citizens protest in the streets...

7
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,102
...and their yearning for democracy intensifies."

8
00:01:33,292 --> 00:01:36,335
SPRING 1980, SEOUL

9
00:01:40,692 --> 00:01:46,622
# Why do I miss so much? #

10
00:01:49,903 --> 00:01:56,203
# To that girl who gave me a bouquet of flowers? #

11
00:01:59,045 --> 00:02:05,495
# His short hair was like a sprinkling of freshly wet grass #

12
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:14,607
# His glowing eyes still shine in my heart #

13
00:02:17,568 --> 00:02:25,568
# Sometimes when I feel alone, I remember that day #

14
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:34,869
# Sometimes when I miss her, I start to dream #

15
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:44,289
# I will never forget that longing #

16
00:02:45,074 --> 00:02:53,074
# How cruel that time has taken her from me #

17
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:09,908
A TAXI DRIVER

18
00:03:10,258 --> 00:03:11,778
PRIVATE TAXI

19
00:03:11,813 --> 00:03:15,288
Down with the state of emergency.

20
00:03:15,575 --> 00:03:17,035
End martial law.

21
00:03:21,657 --> 00:03:23,447
let it end

22
00:03:23,457 --> 00:03:24,957
Will there have been an accident?

23
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:28,335
Disperse or we will use force.

24
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:29,952
I repeat.

25
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,209
spread out...

26
00:03:32,408 --> 00:03:34,038
...or we will use force.

27
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,832
I was wondering why everything was so quiet.

28
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,320
Do they enroll in the university to demonstrate?

29
00:03:44,927 --> 00:03:46,787
It's alright.

30
00:04:09,185 --> 00:04:12,085
I put those guys to work in Saudi Arabia.

31
00:04:12,383 --> 00:04:15,333
Let them work to death under the scorching sun...

32
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,340
...and they would realize how great our country is.

33
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:33,185
Have you seen what happened to my car?

34
00:04:33,582 --> 00:04:34,922
If you come out of nowhere like this...

35
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:36,791
Run!

36
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,210
And where are you?

37
00:04:38,215 --> 00:04:39,539
Hey!

38
00:04:39,797 --> 00:04:40,797
Come back here!

39
00:04:40,896 --> 00:04:42,566
- �Alto!
- Taxi.

40
00:04:42,665 --> 00:04:43,925
Taxi.

41
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:50,339
To the hospital, quickly.

42
00:04:56,691 --> 00:04:58,291
Sir, go faster, please.

43
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,380
First-time births are long.

44
00:05:02,006 --> 00:05:04,796
My wife spent 12 hours in the delivery room.

45
00:05:04,894 --> 00:05:07,074
The first child is always like this.

46
00:05:12,168 --> 00:05:13,588
End martial law.

47
00:05:15,795 --> 00:05:18,675
Don't tell me you're ready.

48
00:05:20,051 --> 00:05:21,251
Shit.

49
00:05:25,755 --> 00:05:28,505
Let's overthrow the dictatorship and bring democracy.

50
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,590
Here we are, honey.

51
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:41,593
The best race of my life.

52
00:05:41,881 --> 00:05:43,251
Over here.

53
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,378
Other taxi drivers do not take pregnant women.

54
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:48,713
But I know, thinking about when my daughter was born.

55
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:51,883
Thanks... honey, and my wallet?

56
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,170
You prepared the bag!

57
00:05:54,508 --> 00:05:56,608
Look again, it must be there.

58
00:05:57,218 --> 00:06:01,178
Sorry, I left it at home. I will pay you tomorrow.

59
00:06:01,213 --> 00:06:03,052
Do you know how many times I've heard that?

60
00:06:03,151 --> 00:06:05,841
With what this degree costs, one pays for a house.

61
00:06:05,876 --> 00:06:07,009
I promise you.

62
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:08,716
There it is again.

63
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:10,275
It is coming.

64
00:06:10,363 --> 00:06:11,553
Hold on a second.

65
00:06:12,123 --> 00:06:14,435
Take my card.

66
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,970
Call me tomorrow. I will pay you double. I'm sorry.

67
00:06:18,506 --> 00:06:20,696
The double?

68
00:06:21,004 --> 00:06:23,674
I wish the best of lucks.

69
00:06:23,941 --> 00:06:25,011
Good luck.

70
00:07:03,096 --> 00:07:05,806
This is not a place to play football.

71
00:07:29,141 --> 00:07:30,351
Has he gone out?

72
00:07:36,474 --> 00:07:38,144
Are you sleeping already, princess?

73
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,970
You should have dinner.

74
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,480
Who has done this to you?

75
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:55,189
Me he ca�do.

76
00:07:56,187 --> 00:07:58,347
Damn Sang-gu.

77
00:07:58,355 --> 00:08:01,355
It wasn't him. I have fallen.

78
00:08:01,723 --> 00:08:03,563
Are you going to lie to your father?

79
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:06,479
Do I give you too?

80
00:08:09,145 --> 00:08:11,725
�Sure! �Sang-gu!

81
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:19,019
Just who I wanted to see.

82
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:22,646
What about this?

83
00:08:23,022 --> 00:08:26,442
How could he do this to my child?

84
00:08:26,477 --> 00:08:28,232
But she also...

85
00:08:28,267 --> 00:08:31,877
I have never seen a girl as wild as Eun-jung.

86
00:08:32,104 --> 00:08:34,854
You are too soft just because your mother died.

87
00:08:34,892 --> 00:08:37,653
That has been...

88
00:08:37,688 --> 00:08:39,768
And since it's here, another thing.

89
00:08:39,976 --> 00:08:42,776
I have bitten my tongue because of your situation...

90
00:08:43,144 --> 00:08:46,564
...but he owes me 100,000 won for rent.

91
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:49,571
I'm sorry, ma'am, I...

92
00:08:49,606 --> 00:08:53,236
They are four months late. At least say when you are going to pay.

93
00:08:53,644 --> 00:08:56,394
100,000 won is also a lot of money for us.

94
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,820
Sang-gu, you look good. You've eaten a lot, haven't you?

95
00:09:02,815 --> 00:09:06,605
I don't care what my husband says, I'm fed up.

96
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:13,502
And tie your daughter in, will you?

97
00:09:13,537 --> 00:09:16,525
It breaks my soul to see my son like this.

98
00:09:33,686 --> 00:09:35,146
How hungry.

99
00:09:35,946 --> 00:09:37,276
Bean sprout soup?

100
00:09:39,273 --> 00:09:42,533
Hey, don't fold the back of the shoes like that.

101
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,070
You don't talk to me?

102
00:09:45,696 --> 00:09:49,316
They are too small for me. Dinner is ready.

103
00:09:50,021 --> 00:09:52,941
Then ask me for new ones.

104
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,280
How good it is.

105
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:08,527
You could get married now if you wanted to.

106
00:10:09,403 --> 00:10:11,233
Sang-gu's mother brought it.

107
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:15,990
I already said that it was salty.

108
00:10:31,115 --> 00:10:33,075
Lift your head.

109
00:10:39,408 --> 00:10:41,528
Dad, are we going to move?

110
00:10:41,536 --> 00:10:44,786
Yes. I'm going to buy Sang-gu's house. When I'm rich.

111
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,071
Don't worry and study hard.

112
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:48,519
okay?

113
00:10:57,611 --> 00:10:58,785
stings

114
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,740
Then why don't you listen?

115
00:11:01,866 --> 00:11:05,576
What have I told you? He plays with him, but don't fight.

116
00:11:05,611 --> 00:11:08,033
But he started.

117
00:11:08,071 --> 00:11:09,411
So you ignore it.

118
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:14,498
Learn to put up with yourself. Life will never be fair.

119
00:11:17,661 --> 00:11:21,701
Do you want to go on a picnic on Wednesday?

120
00:11:22,578 --> 00:11:24,408
As it is Buddha's birthday, there is no school.

121
00:11:25,654 --> 00:11:29,124
You should work. There will be more customers that day.

122
00:11:30,909 --> 00:11:33,579
You are worse than your mother.

123
00:11:34,786 --> 00:11:38,626
You are his spitting image, honey.

124
00:11:44,247 --> 00:11:47,960
With the state of exception declared on May 18...

125
00:11:47,995 --> 00:11:52,085
...and under martial law, all political activity is prohibited...

126
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,210
...universities will remain temporarily closed...

127
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:58,328
...and strikes are strictly prohibited.

128
00:11:59,075 --> 00:12:02,165
Recent student demonstrations...

129
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:06,161
Does this mean I'm losing customers again?

130
00:12:19,535 --> 00:12:22,665
May 19, 1980. Press center. tokyo.

131
00:12:41,037 --> 00:12:42,297
Beer and Sushi again?

132
00:12:42,794 --> 00:12:44,624
Peter, how about in parliament?

133
00:12:47,418 --> 00:12:49,788
As usual.

134
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:54,006
I present to you J�rgen Hinzpeter, from ARD-NDR, Germany.

135
00:12:54,413 --> 00:12:56,413
He has been in Japan for about 8 years.

136
00:12:56,448 --> 00:12:58,172
It can be of help to you.

137
00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:01,499
Nice to meet you, Mr. Hinzpeter. David John, BBC.

138
00:13:02,745 --> 00:13:04,085
Ll�mame Peter.

139
00:13:06,022 --> 00:13:09,082
It's my first time in Japan. Anything I should know?

140
00:13:09,117 --> 00:13:10,289
It's comfortable.

141
00:13:12,127 --> 00:13:13,747
That is dangerous for a journalist.

142
00:13:13,756 --> 00:13:16,046
You should not be in a place where you are comfortable.

143
00:13:16,081 --> 00:13:17,124
how?

144
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:21,043
It does not matter. Where were you before?

145
00:13:21,549 --> 00:13:24,549
In South Korea. The thing is burning there.

146
00:13:24,584 --> 00:13:28,335
The government has declared martial law.

147
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,733
There the situation is always tense.

148
00:13:30,381 --> 00:13:32,053
I think this time it is much worse.

149
00:13:32,088 --> 00:13:34,958
In addition to martial law, they have arrested opposition leaders...

150
00:13:34,966 --> 00:13:37,216
...and the universities have closed.

151
00:13:37,465 --> 00:13:38,635
�Qu� m�s has o�do?

152
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:40,842
I have tried contacting acquaintances...

153
00:13:40,877 --> 00:13:43,171
...but it's almost impossible.

154
00:13:44,377 --> 00:13:45,467
Since when?

155
00:13:45,715 --> 00:13:46,965
Since last night.

156
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:01,843
Seoul, South Korea.

157
00:14:10,343 --> 00:14:11,753
I work for the Church.

158
00:14:12,961 --> 00:14:14,011
I am a missionary.

159
00:14:46,301 --> 00:14:47,511
how long

160
00:14:50,046 --> 00:14:53,716
I need to come back soon. Something smells like serious trouble to me.

161
00:14:53,751 --> 00:14:55,304
Is the thing very bad?

162
00:14:55,842 --> 00:14:58,182
We have been in martial law for 3 days.

163
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,350
Kim Dae-jung is in prison.

164
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,219
...and Kim Young-Sam under house arrest.

165
00:15:15,473 --> 00:15:16,673
�Y Gwanju?

166
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,342
It is a city to the south.

167
00:15:21,637 --> 00:15:25,347
And there's nothing on her? Not one article?

168
00:15:33,138 --> 00:15:35,478
This is the local Gwangju newspaper.

169
00:15:38,053 --> 00:15:39,643
Have they censored the entire page?

170
00:15:41,429 --> 00:15:43,219
What has happened there?

171
00:15:43,254 --> 00:15:44,428
Nobody knows.

172
00:15:44,767 --> 00:15:48,097
They told us about the first casualty on the 19th at 3:00 in the morning.

173
00:15:48,132 --> 00:15:49,514
But now...

174
00:15:50,302 --> 00:15:52,142
...they have even cut the telephone lines.

175
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,390
And the foreign press?

176
00:15:55,768 --> 00:15:58,308
Kim Jae-kyu is on trial today. They are all there.

177
00:15:59,183 --> 00:16:00,933
But the government does not take their eyes off them.

178
00:16:00,968 --> 00:16:03,481
They cannot move freely.

179
00:16:04,718 --> 00:16:06,098
Be careful.

180
00:16:07,476 --> 00:16:12,516
Deber�a ir and Gwangju.

181
00:16:13,141 --> 00:16:14,351
you alone?

182
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,650
And how do you plan to get there?

183
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:27,599
As paranoid as you are about your car...

184
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,731
...how did you break the mirror?

185
00:16:29,766 --> 00:16:33,726
It was a vandal. He ran off after hitting the car.

186
00:16:33,761 --> 00:16:35,980
Before studying, one would have to be a good person.

187
00:16:36,015 --> 00:16:38,103
I will charge you only 5,000 won.

188
00:16:38,138 --> 00:16:41,516
what? Take 4,000. I had a bad day.

189
00:16:41,551 --> 00:16:44,894
what do you say? How can you be so stingy?

190
00:16:45,431 --> 00:16:49,101
And do an inspection. The engine doesn't sound good.

191
00:16:49,136 --> 00:16:51,569
I already inspect it daily.

192
00:16:51,604 --> 00:16:54,394
It has 600,000 km. It is more than paid off.

193
00:16:54,429 --> 00:16:55,986
Be careful with the car.

194
00:16:56,021 --> 00:16:58,521
As it breaks down, it will cost you much more to fix it.

195
00:16:58,556 --> 00:17:01,448
Do not be silly. I've had enough...

196
00:17:01,483 --> 00:17:02,651
...take 3,000.

197
00:17:02,686 --> 00:17:05,606
It's not fair! Do you know what the parts cost me?

198
00:17:06,481 --> 00:17:09,351
- Shall I throw this? - Nothing about that. I will use it.

199
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:11,209
leave it.

200
00:17:12,476 --> 00:17:14,026
Damn, what the fuck.

201
00:17:26,065 --> 00:17:27,315
What are you doing?

202
00:17:30,609 --> 00:17:33,069
God, you are pathetic.

203
00:17:34,106 --> 00:17:35,186
pathetic?

204
00:17:38,603 --> 00:17:39,983
Have the boys been fighting again?

205
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,190
I chastised Sang-gu quite a bit.

206
00:17:43,818 --> 00:17:45,898
Lady, here.

207
00:17:46,235 --> 00:17:48,044
- Yes? - Another ration.

208
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:49,854
No, it's not necessary.

209
00:17:49,863 --> 00:17:51,483
Why not? I already told you that I pay.

210
00:17:51,518 --> 00:17:53,360
Don't be silly, I pay.

211
00:17:53,438 --> 00:17:54,608
What is celebrated?

212
00:17:54,987 --> 00:17:56,527
Instead of inviting me, lend me money.

213
00:17:57,566 --> 00:17:59,318
I already said. how much?

214
00:17:59,353 --> 00:18:02,483
100,000 won. Of what you have saved.

215
00:18:02,518 --> 00:18:07,449
I gave it to my sister for her wedding.

216
00:18:08,194 --> 00:18:10,694
But why so much? You have almost no debts anymore.

217
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,070
Won't it be for rent?

218
00:18:15,358 --> 00:18:16,438
Bingo.

219
00:18:17,236 --> 00:18:18,316
Shit.

220
00:18:18,855 --> 00:18:22,445
Only you would ask your landlord for money to pay the rent.

221
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:27,239
Lend it to me if you don't want me to start talking.

222
00:18:29,277 --> 00:18:31,947
Waitress, bring me something quick.

223
00:18:32,443 --> 00:18:33,863
What's the rush?

224
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:35,903
Let's play a game.

225
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:39,720
I don't. I'm going to the Kukdo theater.

226
00:18:39,955 --> 00:18:41,989
- I have been entrusted with a long journey. - Where?

227
00:18:42,024 --> 00:18:45,574
To Gwangju. We're leaving now and we'll be back before curfew.

228
00:18:45,609 --> 00:18:49,071
You have won the lottery. How much are they going to pay you?

229
00:18:49,477 --> 00:18:50,797
100,000 won.

230
00:18:50,866 --> 00:18:52,076
100,000 won?

231
00:18:52,485 --> 00:18:55,155
Who is such an idiot to pay so much?

232
00:18:55,531 --> 00:18:56,840
An idiot foreigner.

233
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:58,150
And do you speak English?

234
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:01,909
Of course. I grew up near the American base.

235
00:19:01,944 --> 00:19:04,905
And on top of that, foreigners leave a tip.

236
00:19:05,992 --> 00:19:09,202
You spent time abroad. Could you do it?

237
00:19:26,493 --> 00:19:28,993
I'm sorry. Take advantage.

238
00:19:31,868 --> 00:19:36,788
Ma'am, bring Sang-gu to the waist. It is the spitting image of him.

239
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:39,663
And eats a lot. Has she taken it out of you?

240
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:45,040
That boy will find out as soon as he has the money.

241
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,910
Have they called a taxi?

242
00:20:05,368 --> 00:20:11,168
Yes, but this is private. I have called a company.

243
00:20:11,203 --> 00:20:16,662
Yes. The company people are all busy.

244
00:20:16,697 --> 00:20:18,328
They have asked me.

245
00:20:18,574 --> 00:20:20,034
Do you understand the situation?

246
00:20:20,069 --> 00:20:22,164
Sure, I've explained everything.

247
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,544
Have they told you everything?

248
00:20:24,579 --> 00:20:28,919
Yes. We go to Gwangju and return before curfew for 100,000 won.

249
00:20:29,165 --> 00:20:30,625
Do you speak English?

250
00:20:31,202 --> 00:20:32,832
Of course, of course.

251
00:20:32,952 --> 00:20:36,452
I spent 5 years in Saudi Arabia, I speak English.

252
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,330
Don't worry, don't worry. I'm Mr. Kim.

253
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:43,667
Together, we go Gwangju.

254
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:46,202
Very good, nice to meet you.

255
00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:48,249
Come in please.

256
00:20:48,328 --> 00:20:49,418
It's okay.

257
00:20:55,001 --> 00:20:56,001
Thank you.

258
00:20:56,251 --> 00:20:57,251
Be careful.

259
00:21:13,546 --> 00:21:15,416
Take another taxi, this one is reserved.

260
00:21:15,451 --> 00:21:17,663
Reserved? Where to?

261
00:21:17,698 --> 00:21:18,870
why?

262
00:21:19,118 --> 00:21:20,708
I am going to Gwangju.

263
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,790
You first time Korea?

264
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:36,795
No, it's the second.

265
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,964
yes?

266
00:21:43,377 --> 00:21:44,497
Where are you?

267
00:21:45,415 --> 00:21:46,455
From Germany.

268
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,295
Germany, yes?

269
00:21:50,081 --> 00:21:52,040
My friend...

270
00:21:52,075 --> 00:21:53,999
How do you say?

271
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,207
He went to a coal mine.

272
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:00,213
Yes, there are many Korean workers in Germany.

273
00:22:00,248 --> 00:22:02,501
Nurses, miners...

274
00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:04,049
I was Saudi, you know?

275
00:22:04,338 --> 00:22:08,008
Do you know Saudi? This taxi, Saudi money.

276
00:22:08,504 --> 00:22:09,964
I drive a Saudi truck.

277
00:22:09,999 --> 00:22:12,814
What the fuck was driving in that desert!

278
00:22:12,849 --> 00:22:15,629
People here don't know what it's like to work.

279
00:22:16,297 --> 00:22:19,167
Listen, how far to Gwangju?

280
00:22:19,175 --> 00:22:21,215
I don't have much time, I need to get there soon.

281
00:22:21,503 --> 00:22:23,383
Why is he talking so fast?

282
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,880
You fast. Slowly.

283
00:22:28,466 --> 00:22:30,836
So I can English.

284
00:22:31,214 --> 00:22:32,598
Slow down, okay?

285
00:22:32,633 --> 00:22:37,173
It's okay. Gwangju, let's go quickly. okay? fast.

286
00:22:37,297 --> 00:22:38,927
What's the rush?

287
00:22:39,176 --> 00:22:40,610
Gwangju, don't worry.

288
00:22:40,645 --> 00:22:42,045
I am a better driver.

289
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,884
It is very far, go to sleep.

290
00:22:45,089 --> 00:22:47,219
Sleep sleep.

291
00:22:48,628 --> 00:22:49,972
Blessed be.

292
00:22:50,007 --> 00:22:52,507
All my bad luck ends today.

293
00:23:56,344 --> 00:23:58,674
Gwangju, Gwangju.

294
00:23:58,683 --> 00:24:00,263
Gwangju? Have we arrived?

295
00:24:15,098 --> 00:24:17,228
and this? Can't we pass?

296
00:24:19,803 --> 00:24:21,343
Don't brake. follow.

297
00:24:23,011 --> 00:24:24,225
Yes, yes.

298
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,470
What are you recording?

299
00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:27,889
What does it record? What camera?

300
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:28,976
Come on, quick.

301
00:24:31,183 --> 00:24:34,393
Why is he so unfriendly? If they ask you, you answer.

302
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:38,600
And what about this road? Can it happen or not?

303
00:25:01,186 --> 00:25:02,266
and this?

304
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:04,815
I'm not a reporter, you understand?

305
00:25:04,933 --> 00:25:06,813
what?

306
00:25:07,231 --> 00:25:08,691
I told him to speak slowly.

307
00:25:11,397 --> 00:25:12,607
Will they be on maneuvers?

308
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:20,559
High.

309
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,356
Are they on maneuvers?

310
00:25:24,473 --> 00:25:25,763
What division are they from?

311
00:25:25,773 --> 00:25:28,276
I served in the seventh.

312
00:25:28,311 --> 00:25:30,401
It is a real operation. Turn around.

313
00:25:32,557 --> 00:25:34,017
Didn't see the sign?

314
00:25:36,183 --> 00:25:37,957
My passenger is going to Gwangju.

315
00:25:37,992 --> 00:25:39,731
Idiot, do you want to die?

316
00:25:42,647 --> 00:25:43,857
Who the fuck are you?

317
00:25:44,896 --> 00:25:46,106
What does it say?

318
00:25:47,183 --> 00:25:48,483
Are you asking me something?

319
00:25:48,602 --> 00:25:49,772
What did you just say?

320
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:54,650
Let's go, he was wrong.

321
00:25:55,156 --> 00:25:56,376
Goodbye.

322
00:26:09,982 --> 00:26:14,522
Excuse me, driver. This address, also to Gwangju?

323
00:26:19,104 --> 00:26:21,864
No, not Gwanju. Now let's go Seoul.

324
00:26:21,991 --> 00:26:23,381
Seoul?

325
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,860
What does it say? I have to go to Gwangju.

326
00:26:27,358 --> 00:26:29,818
It's not that I refuse to wear it.

327
00:26:30,026 --> 00:26:32,196
Soldier says Gwangju no.

328
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:37,322
Good. If you don't take me, I won't pay you.

329
00:26:38,107 --> 00:26:39,107
Do you understand?

330
00:26:39,856 --> 00:26:41,696
What is he saying?

331
00:26:42,114 --> 00:26:44,324
Not Gwangju, not money.

332
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:45,820
Not money?

333
00:26:46,819 --> 00:26:50,699
Are you kidding? Do you know how much gasoline I have spent?

334
00:26:51,654 --> 00:26:53,194
Soldier says no Gwangju.

335
00:26:53,229 --> 00:26:54,863
We can not go.

336
00:26:54,931 --> 00:26:56,481
No Gwangju.

337
00:26:57,148 --> 00:27:00,068
You. Why does the camera record?

338
00:27:00,446 --> 00:27:01,566
�Por qu� usted Gwangju?

339
00:27:01,601 --> 00:27:02,785
my mother

340
00:27:02,945 --> 00:27:05,016
You know what? You take me to Gwangju.

341
00:27:05,051 --> 00:27:06,821
You don't need to know more. He takes me and I pay him.

342
00:27:06,856 --> 00:27:08,240
That's what we negotiate.

343
00:27:10,947 --> 00:27:11,987
Business?

344
00:27:14,363 --> 00:27:15,653
You businessman?

345
00:27:15,822 --> 00:27:16,942
Is that why you go to Gwangju?

346
00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:21,279
S�, Gwangju.

347
00:27:22,026 --> 00:27:23,736
Not Gwangju, not money.

348
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:27,943
Shit, I'm not wasting gas money.

349
00:27:41,988 --> 00:27:43,118
Lord!

350
00:27:44,236 --> 00:27:45,866
Can you help me?

351
00:27:47,073 --> 00:27:50,863
Is there any road to Gwangju by here ?

352
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,370
No.

353
00:27:54,695 --> 00:27:57,485
Do you know of someone who...?

354
00:27:57,494 --> 00:27:59,574
What are they going to do there?

355
00:27:59,952 --> 00:28:02,662
Haven't you seen the soldiers?

356
00:28:03,527 --> 00:28:06,157
They should go home.

357
00:28:07,495 --> 00:28:10,075
If I can't get to Gwangju...

358
00:28:11,532 --> 00:28:15,082
It is very important that we arrive.

359
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:21,747
The town manager has forbidden us to go there.

360
00:28:27,826 --> 00:28:32,876
Behind that hill there is a path.

361
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,281
where?

362
00:28:34,739 --> 00:28:36,289
Over there.

363
00:28:36,866 --> 00:28:38,536
On that side.

364
00:28:47,368 --> 00:28:50,038
This road is going to destroy my tires.

365
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:54,247
You're lucky to have me.

366
00:28:54,282 --> 00:28:57,372
Anyone else would already be back in Seoul.

367
00:28:59,287 --> 00:29:01,537
Not here soldier.

368
00:29:04,203 --> 00:29:06,163
Brilliant. Not soldier.

369
00:29:14,532 --> 00:29:17,752
What will be happening for them to block even this path?

370
00:29:19,618 --> 00:29:22,078
High. But who...

371
00:29:22,455 --> 00:29:23,455
I turned around.

372
00:29:23,456 --> 00:29:26,086
I'm just trying to make a living.

373
00:29:27,831 --> 00:29:29,581
Did he say he's a businessman?

374
00:29:29,789 --> 00:29:31,209
dollars. Contracts...

375
00:29:31,244 --> 00:29:32,329
Contracts...

376
00:29:34,874 --> 00:29:35,954
Something like this.

377
00:29:36,123 --> 00:29:37,663
Very very important role.

378
00:29:37,791 --> 00:29:40,961
Forgot this in Gwangju, okay?

379
00:29:41,429 --> 00:29:42,889
how?

380
00:29:44,535 --> 00:29:46,415
Good morning. Thank you for the service provided.

381
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:47,242
Say.

382
00:29:47,253 --> 00:29:49,333
I come from Gimpo airport.

383
00:29:49,661 --> 00:29:52,043
That man is a very important businessman.

384
00:29:52,078 --> 00:29:56,248
He has missed his flight to the US to return for some documents.

385
00:29:56,283 --> 00:29:57,913
No. Turn around.

386
00:29:57,948 --> 00:29:59,047
Listen please.

387
00:29:59,082 --> 00:30:02,605
Without those papers, we will not be able to export to the US.

388
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,922
I have come at full speed out of pure patriotism.

389
00:30:05,957 --> 00:30:09,204
We have to export to get dollars, right?

390
00:30:09,212 --> 00:30:11,082
- What's up? - To be a developed country.

391
00:30:11,117 --> 00:30:12,143
Wait.

392
00:30:12,178 --> 00:30:13,670
Listen.

393
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:18,089
If I don't get to Gwangju there will be trouble. Very serious.

394
00:30:18,124 --> 00:30:20,164
My boss is a very important man.

395
00:30:20,173 --> 00:30:23,463
If I don't return with those documents, you won't be happy.

396
00:30:23,498 --> 00:30:25,300
No grace. Tell him.

397
00:30:27,417 --> 00:30:28,797
What has he said?

398
00:30:30,254 --> 00:30:31,624
You say something very serious...?

399
00:30:31,632 --> 00:30:33,132
Tell him, not love.

400
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:35,130
Very important document.

401
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:36,463
Very important.

402
00:30:36,498 --> 00:30:40,218
important man. Important document. Big problem.

403
00:30:51,504 --> 00:30:53,294
Make way.

404
00:30:54,711 --> 00:30:56,014
Come back right away.

405
00:30:56,049 --> 00:30:58,169
The protesters are dangerous.

406
00:30:58,717 --> 00:31:00,337
- Protesters? - Yes.

407
00:31:01,635 --> 00:31:04,215
We'll be back in no time.

408
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,502
Goodbye.

409
00:31:24,964 --> 00:31:27,214
Good job back there.

410
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:28,840
My money.

411
00:31:29,629 --> 00:31:31,679
100,000 won now.

412
00:31:33,385 --> 00:31:36,135
I told him that I would pay him when I got back to Seoul.

413
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:37,504
Gwangju is dangerous.

414
00:31:37,512 --> 00:31:38,632
Pay in advance.

415
00:31:38,671 --> 00:31:39,671
First money.

416
00:31:41,129 --> 00:31:42,809
No, it says "ladies first", so...

417
00:31:43,137 --> 00:31:44,177
Money first.

418
00:31:44,676 --> 00:31:46,216
Korean business style.

419
00:31:46,765 --> 00:31:48,595
Now no money, I'm going Seoul.

420
00:31:49,051 --> 00:31:50,051
Your choice.

421
00:31:51,758 --> 00:31:54,468
Look at me all you want, idiot.

422
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:56,306
Your choice.

423
00:32:09,223 --> 00:32:10,593
I'll give you the rest in Seoul.

424
00:32:11,219 --> 00:32:12,219
Your choice.

425
00:32:14,467 --> 00:32:17,307
What a son of a bitch. Are you copying me?

426
00:32:19,635 --> 00:32:21,095
Still, 50,000 isn't bad at all.

427
00:32:21,183 --> 00:32:23,763
I choice. Come on Gwangju, okay?

428
00:32:24,388 --> 00:32:25,928
Very good.

429
00:32:26,427 --> 00:32:28,267
How low.

430
00:32:29,385 --> 00:32:32,185
If you keep looking at me like that, I'll take your eyes out.

431
00:32:34,429 --> 00:32:36,219
You don't know what I'm saying, do you?

432
00:32:38,306 --> 00:32:39,720
Come on Gwangju.

433
00:32:39,755 --> 00:32:41,134
That's what I said.

434
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:46,510
Citizens of Gwangju crates.

435
00:32:58,387 --> 00:33:00,977
Defend democracy with your life.

436
00:33:01,384 --> 00:33:03,184
What's going on here?

437
00:33:03,219 --> 00:33:05,474
Down with martial law.

438
00:33:06,431 --> 00:33:09,481
Stop the car. What does that mean?

439
00:33:09,516 --> 00:33:10,768
The what?

440
00:33:11,056 --> 00:33:13,806
Here's to the 80s, a decade of hope!

441
00:33:13,894 --> 00:33:15,474
Says...

442
00:33:16,103 --> 00:33:18,393
Hope. Hope, 8.

443
00:33:18,428 --> 00:33:21,348
80. 80 hope.

444
00:33:21,383 --> 00:33:22,574
Hope?

445
00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:23,765
In the 80's...

446
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:27,473
It doesn't matter, forget it. It's nonsense.

447
00:33:31,597 --> 00:33:32,727
What is that?

448
00:33:34,223 --> 00:33:35,893
It seems

449
00:33:37,471 --> 00:33:39,391
Look, a taxi from Seoul.

450
00:33:42,226 --> 00:33:44,106
Well, a foreigner.

451
00:33:44,854 --> 00:33:46,604
Hello. Where are they going?

452
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:47,953
- What does it say? - Well...

453
00:33:47,988 --> 00:33:49,183
Don't you have a camera?

454
00:33:50,939 --> 00:33:54,149
Those university students speak English worse than me.

455
00:33:55,435 --> 00:33:57,855
Hey, Jae-sik, don't you know English?

456
00:33:58,981 --> 00:34:01,231
Come, Jae-sik.

457
00:34:01,979 --> 00:34:03,439
Why me?

458
00:34:04,846 --> 00:34:06,016
Hello.

459
00:34:06,304 --> 00:34:07,514
Hello.

460
00:34:07,524 --> 00:34:08,684
�A th�nd of?

461
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:12,850
Where are you from?

462
00:34:14,148 --> 00:34:16,688
From Germany. From the ARD network in Germany.

463
00:34:16,725 --> 00:34:22,315
German. Are you a reporter?

464
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,810
Yes. I am a reporter.

465
00:34:26,318 --> 00:34:30,068
He is a reporter from Germany who has come to record us.

466
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:37,070
We're going to be on the news! Great!

467
00:34:37,476 --> 00:34:39,566
So a businessman.

468
00:34:39,735 --> 00:34:41,419
If you are a reporter, you should have told me.

469
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,104
He has come by taxi from Seoul.

470
00:34:43,442 --> 00:34:46,322
Applaud the taxi driver who has driven so much.

471
00:34:49,644 --> 00:34:51,144
Actually, from Seoul to here...

472
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:52,330
Where are they going now...

473
00:34:52,365 --> 00:34:53,482
...is there a lot of distance?

474
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:57,440
Let's go to the hospital.

475
00:34:59,027 --> 00:35:00,107
�Puedo and?

476
00:35:00,624 --> 00:35:01,834
Yes.

477
00:35:01,869 --> 00:35:04,084
I would like to interview him.

478
00:35:05,861 --> 00:35:07,231
He wants to interview you.

479
00:35:07,729 --> 00:35:09,529
You are a star!

480
00:35:09,606 --> 00:35:12,776
I should have washed my face.

481
00:35:21,106 --> 00:35:22,446
Come up too, sir.

482
00:35:23,364 --> 00:35:24,488
what do you say?

483
00:35:24,523 --> 00:35:26,233
You can't get out of the cab.

484
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,150
Don't worry.

485
00:35:29,109 --> 00:35:30,899
I follow it.

486
00:35:31,817 --> 00:35:32,857
I'm going too.

487
00:35:33,526 --> 00:35:34,866
Well, follow us.

488
00:35:36,323 --> 00:35:37,693
Come on.

489
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:49,401
We fight for justice. Hooray! Hooray!

490
00:35:49,436 --> 00:35:52,323
We live and die together. Hooray! Hooray!

491
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:55,408
We would rather die on our feet than live on our knees.

492
00:35:55,443 --> 00:35:57,866
We fight for justice.

493
00:35:57,901 --> 00:36:01,491
I already knew that the 100,000 won thing was too good.

494
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,200
Citizens of Gwangju, nanse.

495
00:36:05,526 --> 00:36:09,036
Citizens of Gwangju, citizens of Gwangju.

496
00:36:09,071 --> 00:36:12,112
Citizens of Gwangju, nanse.

497
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:26,740
I can't risk getting my car hit at a demonstration.

498
00:36:30,781 --> 00:36:32,204
Taxi!

499
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:35,079
Take me, sir.

500
00:36:35,237 --> 00:36:38,537
Take a taxi from Gwangju, se�ora. Este es de Alone.

501
00:36:41,951 --> 00:36:43,371
Shit.

502
00:36:51,614 --> 00:36:54,074
Can you at least pay?

503
00:36:57,659 --> 00:36:59,122
Who is in the hospital?

504
00:36:59,157 --> 00:37:02,367
They say that someone who looks like my little son...

505
00:37:03,324 --> 00:37:07,204
...entered after having his head smashed in by a soldier.

506
00:37:07,618 --> 00:37:10,708
Are you university? Was he manifesting himself?

507
00:37:10,785 --> 00:37:13,825
He hasn't even been to high school.

508
00:37:14,622 --> 00:37:18,202
He didn't come home last night.

509
00:37:18,948 --> 00:37:23,168
He will have been drinking with his friends.

510
00:37:23,494 --> 00:37:25,834
He can't drink.

511
00:37:26,242 --> 00:37:32,019
The soldiers have gone mad...

512
00:37:32,054 --> 00:37:37,796
...and beat and stab people.

513
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:43,331
Ma'am, I was a sergeant in the army. A soldier would never do that.

514
00:37:43,955 --> 00:37:46,375
They're just rumors, right?

515
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:47,583
Clear.

516
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:54,290
And then where has he gone?

517
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:14,543
I don't take you

518
00:38:14,578 --> 00:38:17,088
See if they need help.

519
00:38:18,414 --> 00:38:20,204
Please take me. I'm in a hurry.

520
00:38:20,212 --> 00:38:21,752
Why so much haste?

521
00:38:22,251 --> 00:38:25,001
You won't be able to write a single line in the newspaper.

522
00:38:25,248 --> 00:38:28,338
Now journalists have more free time than anyone.

523
00:38:28,544 --> 00:38:32,007
If they can't report, why take them anywhere?

524
00:38:32,042 --> 00:38:36,132
Gwangju taxi drivers will be rich if they can turn away customers.

525
00:38:38,444 --> 00:38:39,914
ma'am.

526
00:38:39,949 --> 00:38:42,294
Take me, please.

527
00:38:42,329 --> 00:38:43,422
Nothing of that.

528
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:44,631
Shit.

529
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,790
Taxi, taxi.

530
00:38:46,796 --> 00:38:49,626
No, this taxi is from Seoul. Take one from Gwangju.

531
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,000
Go to the other side.

532
00:38:57,035 --> 00:38:58,049
Shit.

533
00:38:58,796 --> 00:39:00,206
Qu� horror.

534
00:39:00,215 --> 00:39:01,375
A high school student?

535
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:02,715
Carefully.

536
00:39:03,334 --> 00:39:05,214
Call a doctor.

537
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:07,550
Doctor.

538
00:39:07,628 --> 00:39:08,878
Doctor.

539
00:39:09,256 --> 00:39:14,716
Find my son. I beg you.

540
00:39:16,459 --> 00:39:18,549
�D�nde est�s, Yong-pyo?

541
00:39:33,964 --> 00:39:37,424
Yong-pyo! my son...

542
00:39:41,029 --> 00:39:42,509
ok?

543
00:39:42,544 --> 00:39:43,828
Mom?

544
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:45,983
Mom!

545
00:39:46,018 --> 00:39:47,216
�Yong-pyo!

546
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:48,841
What are you doing here?

547
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:51,550
�Maldito seas!

548
00:39:52,548 --> 00:39:55,258
I thought something horrible had happened to you.

549
00:39:56,254 --> 00:39:59,057
are you okay?

550
00:39:59,092 --> 00:40:02,592
It's no big deal. They only gave me 3 points.

551
00:40:03,047 --> 00:40:04,637
Have you done anything else?

552
00:40:04,672 --> 00:40:06,887
IM perfectly.

553
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,279
Sir, thank you very much.

554
00:40:12,314 --> 00:40:14,678
Thank you, really.

555
00:40:14,713 --> 00:40:15,968
Put this on, mom.

556
00:40:16,296 --> 00:40:20,346
I don't know what I would have done without him.

557
00:40:20,381 --> 00:40:21,471
Thank you very much.

558
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:24,389
Do you have money?

559
00:40:24,928 --> 00:40:26,258
No.

560
00:40:26,386 --> 00:40:28,966
It doesn't matter, you don't have to pay me.

561
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,303
see? I told him it would be fine.

562
00:40:31,342 --> 00:40:34,302
Wait. You are the taxi driver of Seoul.

563
00:40:35,547 --> 00:40:36,797
Do you know me?

564
00:40:36,806 --> 00:40:37,886
Are you.

565
00:40:38,765 --> 00:40:41,766
Do you know him?

566
00:40:41,801 --> 00:40:43,641
- A while ago, this guy... - Hey!

567
00:40:46,888 --> 00:40:47,932
What are you doing here?

568
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:50,177
Do you know how much time I've wasted looking for him?

569
00:40:50,384 --> 00:40:52,684
We have gone from one place to another in search of it.

570
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:54,012
Where is my work bag?

571
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:57,680
Who do you think you are to yell at my driver?

572
00:40:58,516 --> 00:41:01,426
He fled with this reporter's team.

573
00:41:02,683 --> 00:41:04,053
what do you say?

574
00:41:04,431 --> 00:41:05,684
How dare you?

575
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:08,639
I have not taken anything.

576
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:11,378
What is happening?

577
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:13,724
For what.

578
00:41:17,719 --> 00:41:18,889
What is this doing here?

579
00:41:21,265 --> 00:41:23,225
I don't know.

580
00:41:23,475 --> 00:41:24,845
I really don't know.

581
00:41:25,391 --> 00:41:27,641
He said he would follow us and then he took off.

582
00:41:28,179 --> 00:41:32,179
I don't know the streets here. Do you know what it took me to find them?

583
00:41:32,185 --> 00:41:34,435
Do not lie.

584
00:41:35,183 --> 00:41:37,141
Everyone saw him turn around.

585
00:41:37,176 --> 00:41:39,100
Yong-pyo, be careful what you say.

586
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:42,809
How was he going to leave without charging?

587
00:41:42,846 --> 00:41:46,147
Take the other half.

588
00:41:46,182 --> 00:41:48,772
Go to Seoul. I'm better alone.

589
00:41:48,968 --> 00:41:52,478
how? 50,000 won to come here?

590
00:41:53,725 --> 00:41:57,475
In reality, they agreed to 100,000 and had already collected half.

591
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:58,854
100,000 won?

592
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,190
They had paid him and still left?

593
00:42:04,226 --> 00:42:05,436
Take it and go.

594
00:42:05,895 --> 00:42:07,515
Tom.

595
00:42:08,972 --> 00:42:11,022
Why do you give him money?

596
00:42:11,689 --> 00:42:13,689
It makes all taxi drivers look bad.

597
00:42:14,148 --> 00:42:18,438
People like this have to be taught a lesson.

598
00:42:18,724 --> 00:42:21,734
Whose side are they on?

599
00:42:21,769 --> 00:42:23,560
Do not yell at me.

600
00:42:24,346 --> 00:42:26,686
What am I right?

601
00:42:27,434 --> 00:42:29,144
Why don't you say anything?

602
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:30,484
And what do you want me to say?

603
00:42:32,479 --> 00:42:34,979
If he had already charged...

604
00:42:35,478 --> 00:42:38,188
...wasn't going to let a customer down.

605
00:42:38,726 --> 00:42:41,896
What a coward you are.

606
00:42:42,271 --> 00:42:43,851
I am not a coward.

607
00:42:44,348 --> 00:42:47,148
You know I'm firm when I have to be. Or not?

608
00:42:47,183 --> 00:42:50,776
I will pay for this.

609
00:42:51,024 --> 00:42:55,024
It is wrong as a taxi driver and it is wrong as a human being.

610
00:42:55,059 --> 00:42:58,229
How dare you speak to me like that?

611
00:43:00,815 --> 00:43:03,905
It seems that everything was true.

612
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:06,400
To see your license number.

613
00:43:06,435 --> 00:43:08,648
What does he do?

614
00:43:11,234 --> 00:43:12,944
That's it!

615
00:43:13,811 --> 00:43:16,561
That's it, I'm not taking anything.

616
00:43:33,734 --> 00:43:34,814
Come on.

617
00:43:40,149 --> 00:43:43,109
Boy, are you going to spend the day in my car?

618
00:43:45,113 --> 00:43:47,323
He has asked me to translate for him.

619
00:43:48,271 --> 00:43:50,441
Do your parents know what you do?

620
00:43:50,608 --> 00:43:52,698
Why are you giving me the sermon?

621
00:43:52,735 --> 00:43:54,985
Haven't you seen what's happening?

622
00:43:55,274 --> 00:43:57,694
Your mother must be very worried.

623
00:43:58,531 --> 00:44:03,401
With how expensive the tuition is, do you waste time in demonstrations?

624
00:44:03,406 --> 00:44:06,696
If you've signed up to study, study, dammit.

625
00:44:08,072 --> 00:44:10,032
I did not enroll to study.

626
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:16,566
I went to compete in the college music contest.

627
00:44:20,492 --> 00:44:24,992
And why don't you spend the time practicing?

628
00:44:25,445 --> 00:44:28,618
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

629
00:44:28,653 --> 00:44:32,823
Do students think that life everywhere is as good as here?

630
00:44:32,858 --> 00:44:34,703
Go to Saudi Arabia, in that scorching heat.

631
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:37,908
What good is a country where the army attacks you?

632
00:44:37,943 --> 00:44:40,077
Then why do you manifest?

633
00:44:40,112 --> 00:44:43,862
They keep telling you to leave it and continue.

634
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:47,949
How is it possible for a foreigner to understand you better than you?

635
00:44:47,984 --> 00:44:49,026
Forget it.

636
00:44:49,035 --> 00:44:50,695
7 o'clock we go Seoul, ok?

637
00:44:52,872 --> 00:44:54,932
OK.

638
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:56,830
Promise, 7 o'clock.

639
00:44:58,278 --> 00:44:59,998
Are you on the right track?

640
00:45:00,694 --> 00:45:04,495
Yes, don't worry. It's over here.

641
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:07,370
We turn right here and then we go further.

642
00:45:08,737 --> 00:45:10,157
Ah.

643
00:45:10,286 --> 00:45:11,289
God!

644
00:45:11,324 --> 00:45:13,324
The detour has been passed.

645
00:45:13,702 --> 00:45:15,122
Gasoline.

646
00:45:15,201 --> 00:45:16,991
I have to fill the tank.

647
00:45:21,196 --> 00:45:23,456
Gasoline.

648
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:31,247
High.

649
00:45:33,116 --> 00:45:34,616
Put 3,000 won.

650
00:45:35,911 --> 00:45:37,911
Did you think that I was going to leave him lying?

651
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,330
I am not like that.

652
00:45:46,781 --> 00:45:48,161
What have I said?

653
00:45:48,164 --> 00:45:49,164
That you are not like that.

654
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:51,199
No, the one at the gas station. 3,000 won.

655
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:52,787
- Right? - Yes.

656
00:45:53,825 --> 00:45:57,285
Still. Is he crazy?

657
00:45:58,031 --> 00:46:00,414
- What are you doing? - What's up?

658
00:46:00,449 --> 00:46:03,159
I have asked him for 3,000 won of gasoline. Nothing else.

659
00:46:03,167 --> 00:46:04,167
what?

660
00:46:04,286 --> 00:46:06,209
Do you think I'm going to be fooled?

661
00:46:06,244 --> 00:46:08,664
It may not be from here, but this is an outrage.

662
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:10,911
He has given me more.

663
00:46:10,946 --> 00:46:13,160
But what's wrong with him?

664
00:46:13,827 --> 00:46:16,327
Why are you worried that I put more...

665
00:46:16,362 --> 00:46:20,046
...if not, am I going to charge it?

666
00:46:20,292 --> 00:46:24,832
If I fill it up, he'll beat me up.

667
00:46:26,036 --> 00:46:27,076
Is it free?

668
00:46:27,086 --> 00:46:30,296
Did you think that people here are like you?

669
00:46:39,084 --> 00:46:42,754
Why didn't you tell me it was free? I would have filled it.

670
00:46:42,789 --> 00:46:46,880
So fill it up before you go back to Seoul.

671
00:46:46,995 --> 00:46:49,585
Clear. From here to Seoul a lot of gasoline is spent.

672
00:46:50,583 --> 00:46:51,963
But why is it free?

673
00:46:52,002 --> 00:46:53,712
Didn't you see the hospital taxis?

674
00:46:53,919 --> 00:46:56,579
The taxi drivers are having a hard time.

675
00:46:57,127 --> 00:46:59,377
Several have been arrested for carrying injured people.

676
00:46:59,666 --> 00:47:04,046
And what's wrong with it? You don't choose your clients.

677
00:47:04,081 --> 00:47:05,540
That's what I'm going to

678
00:47:05,828 --> 00:47:09,128
We have not done anything to suffer like this either.

679
00:47:14,672 --> 00:47:17,132
Citizens, unite at the provincial office.

680
00:47:21,544 --> 00:47:23,744
Let's kick the soldiers out.

681
00:47:24,212 --> 00:47:26,332
Over there.

682
00:47:28,338 --> 00:47:32,628
Neighbors of Gwangju, we are in this together.

683
00:47:32,965 --> 00:47:35,215
Let's expel the soldiers.

684
00:47:35,793 --> 00:47:39,673
Let's get them out of here and protect our city.

685
00:47:45,503 --> 00:47:49,503
Citizens, we must act.

686
00:47:50,588 --> 00:47:53,468
make way A reporter comes.

687
00:47:53,797 --> 00:47:59,637
He has come all the way from Seoul to report. Make way.

688
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:01,463
Thank you. Thank you.

689
00:48:01,498 --> 00:48:02,837
He is a reporter.

690
00:48:04,005 --> 00:48:05,295
A foreigner?

691
00:48:05,544 --> 00:48:07,344
Thank you.

692
00:48:07,633 --> 00:48:09,253
Have you come here?

693
00:48:12,667 --> 00:48:14,377
Make way, please.

694
00:48:23,007 --> 00:48:25,967
You will work best on a full stomach. Take.

695
00:48:26,135 --> 00:48:28,345
and this? Thank you.

696
00:48:29,672 --> 00:48:31,712
- Are you hungry? try. - Thank you.

697
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,920
- Do they really not care? - We have already eaten.

698
00:48:33,929 --> 00:48:35,549
Thank you so much.

699
00:48:35,796 --> 00:48:37,256
Thanks to you.

700
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:07,600
Why are you angry? We'll be right back.

701
00:49:08,465 --> 00:49:11,135
If they scratch my car, are you going to pay for it?

702
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:28,930
Hello. Where does it come from?

703
00:49:29,348 --> 00:49:31,928
From Germany. My name is Peter.

704
00:49:32,804 --> 00:49:36,094
I'm Choi from the local newspaper. How did you get there?

705
00:49:36,642 --> 00:49:39,102
They have cut all the roads.

706
00:49:39,137 --> 00:49:40,349
In taxi.

707
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:51,020
Together in life and in death!

708
00:49:51,387 --> 00:49:55,097
We would rather die on our feet than live on our knees.

709
00:49:55,132 --> 00:49:57,857
We fight for justice.

710
00:49:57,892 --> 00:50:00,312
Afternoon of May 20, 1980 Geumnam Street, Gwangju.

711
00:50:02,677 --> 00:50:06,267
Citizens, unite.

712
00:50:06,513 --> 00:50:09,973
Citizens...

713
00:50:10,008 --> 00:50:12,314
...join.

714
00:50:12,349 --> 00:50:14,639
Will you hold this for me?

715
00:50:14,727 --> 00:50:16,097
Clear.

716
00:50:18,053 --> 00:50:19,433
imbecile

717
00:50:39,432 --> 00:50:43,482
This province has the best food.

718
00:50:43,889 --> 00:50:46,559
It seems simple, but it is very good.

719
00:50:46,857 --> 00:50:47,897
The dressing is perfect.

720
00:50:47,932 --> 00:50:49,017
Be very careful.

721
00:50:49,765 --> 00:50:53,895
The Korean press cannot be here and the foreign press is not welcome.

722
00:50:54,269 --> 00:50:58,019
If they find out you're here, they'll come after you.

723
00:50:58,765 --> 00:51:01,395
And for those who help him.

724
00:51:07,307 --> 00:51:09,317
what? Do you want one?

725
00:51:09,814 --> 00:51:12,274
Eat. Nothing happens here.

726
00:51:12,309 --> 00:51:13,443
No, thanks.

727
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:16,060
What's with that face?

728
00:51:16,148 --> 00:51:17,308
It's no big deal.

729
00:52:23,697 --> 00:52:25,107
I have to go with them.

730
00:52:25,155 --> 00:52:26,865
Don't get involved, stay here.

731
00:52:28,233 --> 00:52:30,073
How am I going to keep watching?

732
00:52:30,231 --> 00:52:32,191
And what difference is there?

733
00:52:32,739 --> 00:52:34,279
Okay, let's go down.

734
00:52:34,447 --> 00:52:36,071
to where? Oh?

735
00:52:36,106 --> 00:52:38,986
No no no. here we are Ah danger.

736
00:52:39,021 --> 00:52:40,073
Here safe.

737
00:52:40,152 --> 00:52:41,432
You stay, we go down.

738
00:52:41,531 --> 00:52:43,531
That one takes the photos from here.

739
00:52:44,278 --> 00:52:45,528
�A th�nd of?

740
00:52:55,818 --> 00:52:56,948
What's up?

741
00:53:03,651 --> 00:53:06,111
Down with Chun Doo-hwan.

742
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:16,530
Danger danger.

743
00:53:16,699 --> 00:53:18,779
If you are going to record, do it from there.

744
00:53:18,814 --> 00:53:20,576
Here it is very dangerous.

745
00:53:20,984 --> 00:53:22,494
Let's go, let's go.

746
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:27,929
ok?

747
00:53:27,964 --> 00:53:28,965
I'm sorry.

748
00:53:28,987 --> 00:53:30,160
What the hell is wrong with him?

749
00:53:30,195 --> 00:53:33,245
This is why I say it is dangerous.

750
00:53:34,243 --> 00:53:36,033
- Come on. - Do not touch me.

751
00:54:19,951 --> 00:54:22,331
The soldiers have gone mad.

752
00:54:24,786 --> 00:54:28,746
Communist fucking. You have to teach him a lesson.

753
00:54:29,583 --> 00:54:30,793
Get rid of him.

754
00:54:33,658 --> 00:54:35,748
Who is that?

755
00:54:36,744 --> 00:54:37,744
Let's go for him.

756
00:54:37,914 --> 00:54:41,704
Do you want to die? You have to get out of here.

757
00:54:49,163 --> 00:54:51,083
Sir, this way. Over here.

758
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:52,162
Over here.

759
00:54:52,196 --> 00:54:53,561
fast.

760
00:55:26,081 --> 00:55:27,581
what? Isn't it...?

761
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,039
sir.

762
00:55:42,795 --> 00:55:45,005
fast.

763
00:56:12,508 --> 00:56:14,878
Look, I told you it was dangerous.

764
00:56:18,501 --> 00:56:20,131
Is it very expensive?

765
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:24,469
I had never seen one. I ask him?

766
00:56:24,504 --> 00:56:25,946
No.

767
00:56:28,882 --> 00:56:30,962
what? It wasn't my fault.

768
00:56:36,046 --> 00:56:38,466
But why does the army behave like this?

769
00:56:39,044 --> 00:56:43,094
They hit and persecute people who have done nothing.

770
00:56:44,298 --> 00:56:47,678
I don't know either. We do not know.

771
00:56:49,044 --> 00:56:50,844
God, look what time it is.

772
00:56:50,923 --> 00:56:52,673
Hey, let's go Seoul.

773
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:56,010
Yes, it's fine. Let's go back.

774
00:56:56,045 --> 00:56:57,307
Good.

775
00:56:57,716 --> 00:57:00,136
And what about you? We are leaving.

776
00:57:00,754 --> 00:57:04,383
Leave me there.

777
00:57:04,418 --> 00:57:05,548
- OK. - Thank you.

778
00:57:13,172 --> 00:57:15,132
Promise me one thing.

779
00:57:16,429 --> 00:57:17,929
He is going to teach what has happened.

780
00:57:20,174 --> 00:57:24,174
As soon as this is on the air, the whole world will see it.

781
00:57:24,971 --> 00:57:26,181
They are not alone.

782
00:57:28,337 --> 00:57:29,547
Thank you very much.

783
00:57:37,388 --> 00:57:39,468
Have a nice trip.

784
00:57:39,966 --> 00:57:41,306
Wait boy.

785
00:57:42,174 --> 00:57:43,844
What's your name?

786
00:57:44,922 --> 00:57:46,932
Jae-sik. Gu Jae-sik.

787
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:49,850
Gu Jae-sik... Practice a lot.

788
00:57:49,885 --> 00:57:51,637
I want to see you on TV.

789
00:57:53,175 --> 00:57:54,175
OK.

790
00:57:57,011 --> 00:57:58,181
Have a nice trip.

791
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:19,053
Not again.

792
00:58:27,764 --> 00:58:29,144
Has it been spoiled?

793
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:31,640
What's up?

794
00:58:59,764 --> 00:59:00,854
Isn't it...?

795
00:59:00,972 --> 00:59:03,222
I told you. The taxi driver from Seoul.

796
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:04,599
You were right.

797
00:59:04,634 --> 00:59:05,639
It doesn't work?

798
00:59:06,017 --> 00:59:07,847
what a job

799
00:59:08,265 --> 00:59:10,099
The workshop is closed.

800
00:59:10,134 --> 00:59:11,933
- I think so. - Yes.

801
00:59:30,147 --> 00:59:31,937
I'm sure they'll fix it soon.

802
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,230
Is it your daughter?

803
00:59:49,309 --> 00:59:52,269
What beauty.

804
00:59:52,277 --> 00:59:55,697
You must have hidden talents. His wife is very attractive.

805
00:59:56,601 --> 00:59:58,981
What a relief that the girl has come out to her instead of...

806
01:00:02,686 --> 01:00:05,776
His daughter. She is attractive, isn't she?

807
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:07,942
I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

808
01:00:07,977 --> 01:00:09,111
Do not touch.

809
01:00:13,555 --> 01:00:15,279
is it already?

810
01:00:15,314 --> 01:00:16,524
- Yes, one second. - OK.

811
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:18,482
Ready. Turn on to see

812
01:00:18,517 --> 01:00:19,901
Dale.

813
01:00:29,111 --> 01:00:31,731
This car has more than 600,000 km.

814
01:00:32,608 --> 01:00:35,068
How could he have come here?

815
01:00:35,396 --> 01:00:39,116
- The transmission is very old. - Do I have to change the starter motor?

816
01:00:39,562 --> 01:00:41,195
Lots of work.

817
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:44,610
There are no parts left in the workshop.

818
01:00:46,946 --> 01:00:51,276
And if we put one from another car? I can give you mine.

819
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:57,150
Better mine, I have changed it recently.

820
01:00:57,156 --> 01:00:59,699
For now it stays here.

821
01:00:59,734 --> 01:01:03,984
He will find a way to make it go a little distance.

822
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:05,360
How long will it take?

823
01:01:05,739 --> 01:01:07,609
I have to be in Seoul before curfew.

824
01:01:08,775 --> 01:01:11,275
- At least two hours. - Yes.

825
01:01:11,483 --> 01:01:13,366
I will have to leave tomorrow.

826
01:01:13,401 --> 01:01:15,571
The curfew here is at 21:00.

827
01:01:15,606 --> 01:01:17,858
You can't be out afterwards.

828
01:01:18,776 --> 01:01:20,616
- Is there a telephone here? - Why?

829
01:01:20,944 --> 01:01:23,534
Those bastards have cut the lines.

830
01:01:23,569 --> 01:01:24,931
what?

831
01:01:28,107 --> 01:01:31,447
Is there no way to call? I have to call home.

832
01:01:31,482 --> 01:01:33,906
Why are you so worried?

833
01:01:33,941 --> 01:01:36,581
If a man has to work he can spend a night or two away.

834
01:01:36,628 --> 01:01:41,278
My daughter is home alone. He is 11 years old.

835
01:01:41,313 --> 01:01:43,285
And his mother?

836
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:44,233
what?

837
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:45,782
Poor dear.

838
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,360
Too young to be alone.

839
01:01:51,526 --> 01:01:53,036
my mother

840
01:01:56,652 --> 01:02:00,492
Mr. Kim, if it's about the money, let me pay for the repair.

841
01:02:04,284 --> 01:02:06,404
Have I asked you for money, idiot?

842
01:02:07,991 --> 01:02:09,805
He knew everything, didn't he?

843
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,288
Danger, I knew.

844
01:02:11,323 --> 01:02:12,701
Why are you yelling at me?

845
01:02:12,736 --> 01:02:14,816
It's not my fault the car broke down.

846
01:02:14,864 --> 01:02:16,404
And you knew where he was going.

847
01:02:16,573 --> 01:02:17,996
What does this jerk say?

848
01:02:18,031 --> 01:02:21,951
calm down. He says that you knew it would be dangerous.

849
01:02:21,986 --> 01:02:24,037
And shit. I didn't know.

850
01:02:24,577 --> 01:02:27,287
And why do you always do his part?

851
01:02:27,322 --> 01:02:28,574
what?

852
01:02:28,952 --> 01:02:30,202
Accept the money.

853
01:02:30,237 --> 01:02:32,202
Ag�rrello. Tom.

854
01:02:32,238 --> 01:02:33,617
Apart from me.

855
01:02:33,652 --> 01:02:34,997
I do not want it.

856
01:02:42,538 --> 01:02:43,538
Yeah, okay.

857
01:02:44,496 --> 01:02:46,406
calm down. Enough.

858
01:02:49,074 --> 01:02:51,164
my mother

859
01:03:12,292 --> 01:03:13,912
Your daughter is home alone.

860
01:03:14,330 --> 01:03:17,580
But he can't go to Seoul. You can't call.

861
01:03:20,535 --> 01:03:24,045
J�rgen Hinzpeter, Asia correspondent for German public television.

862
01:03:25,661 --> 01:03:26,921
It has come from Japan.

863
01:03:31,663 --> 01:03:34,453
What are those useless customs people doing?

864
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:39,291
He did not register as a journalist when he entered and he slipped away.

865
01:03:39,995 --> 01:03:42,415
He posed as a missionary.

866
01:03:42,834 --> 01:03:46,214
It seems that he has planned everything.

867
01:03:47,619 --> 01:03:51,129
He is in a taxi from Seoul, it will be easy to find him.

868
01:03:52,415 --> 01:03:54,295
Does he live there? In the house on the corner?

869
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:55,583
Beside.

870
01:03:56,251 --> 01:03:57,751
We're almost there.

871
01:04:04,543 --> 01:04:05,833
Come on, quick.

872
01:04:08,461 --> 01:04:11,671
Honey? Am at home.

873
01:04:13,455 --> 01:04:14,585
Dad.

874
01:04:14,663 --> 01:04:17,293
God, why are you coming so late?

875
01:04:17,328 --> 01:04:18,792
Everything has happened.

876
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:22,380
Have you stayed up waiting for dad?

877
01:04:23,876 --> 01:04:24,969
Who are they?

878
01:04:25,004 --> 01:04:27,544
It is a long story. Can you make us dinner?

879
01:04:27,831 --> 01:04:31,751
- Yes, but there is not much. - Some kimchi will suffice.

880
01:04:31,786 --> 01:04:34,339
Let's go ahead.

881
01:04:36,755 --> 01:04:38,375
It's enough with the kimchi.

882
01:04:39,133 --> 01:04:40,463
Between.

883
01:04:49,882 --> 01:04:53,172
Is this all we can offer such important guests?

884
01:04:57,715 --> 01:05:01,885
Don't worry. Her neighbors will take care of her daughter.

885
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:05,720
I can call her tomorrow on the way.

886
01:05:06,127 --> 01:05:07,167
Yes.

887
01:05:07,176 --> 01:05:09,136
Dad, I'm hungry.

888
01:05:09,425 --> 01:05:12,843
Go ahead, eat. Aren't you hungry?

889
01:05:12,878 --> 01:05:16,222
Try this. My wife does it.

890
01:05:16,257 --> 01:05:19,717
It is crunchy and a little bitter, but with a very good touch...

891
01:05:19,752 --> 01:05:22,756
I don't know if it will be your style, but try it.

892
01:05:22,791 --> 01:05:24,132
try.

893
01:05:28,638 --> 01:05:29,641
That stinks.

894
01:05:29,676 --> 01:05:31,428
It's spicy, it's itchy.

895
01:05:31,463 --> 01:05:33,843
It doesn't matter. I hold the spicy.

896
01:05:39,086 --> 01:05:40,466
He knows how to eat.

897
01:05:41,545 --> 01:05:43,055
God, how itchy.

898
01:05:43,214 --> 01:05:44,264
Water.

899
01:05:44,921 --> 01:05:46,381
- How? - Water.

900
01:05:50,427 --> 01:05:52,257
It itches too much.

901
01:05:52,594 --> 01:05:53,808
Pica.

902
01:05:53,843 --> 01:05:57,053
It didn't surprise me. She has eaten it lightly.

903
01:05:59,968 --> 01:06:01,718
What is he laughing at?

904
01:06:02,636 --> 01:06:06,056
He comes to a foreign country, his camera breaks, he eats kimchi...

905
01:06:06,091 --> 01:06:07,973
You have been through a lot too.

906
01:06:11,927 --> 01:06:13,241
Why have you come?

907
01:06:13,276 --> 01:06:14,556
Why does he come here?

908
01:06:15,634 --> 01:06:16,724
Reporter.

909
01:06:17,431 --> 01:06:18,641
Was that English?

910
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:22,180
Do taxi drivers in Seoul know English?

911
01:06:22,215 --> 01:06:23,519
I am a reporter.

912
01:06:23,927 --> 01:06:26,307
Reporters go where the news is.

913
01:06:26,342 --> 01:06:28,933
Translate what you have said.

914
01:06:31,548 --> 01:06:37,598
I'm a reporter here for the news, or something.

915
01:06:39,182 --> 01:06:40,302
Is it true?

916
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:41,760
Yes.

917
01:06:43,517 --> 01:06:46,637
It's amazing. I would never have guessed.

918
01:06:49,182 --> 01:06:51,012
Why did you become a reporter?

919
01:06:55,807 --> 01:06:58,729
No, that means money.

920
01:06:58,764 --> 01:07:01,184
Did he become a reporter for the money?

921
01:07:01,211 --> 01:07:02,431
Yes.

922
01:07:02,466 --> 01:07:05,771
And what do you spend it on?

923
01:07:12,931 --> 01:07:14,271
It has a hole in the sock.

924
01:07:15,559 --> 01:07:18,979
He poses as a big shot, but it looks like he's not.

925
01:07:19,095 --> 01:07:21,895
How can you be worse dressed than a widower like me?

926
01:07:30,725 --> 01:07:32,855
The army massacres civilians in Gwangju.

927
01:07:32,890 --> 01:07:34,813
This I know is a newspaper.

928
01:07:35,730 --> 01:07:39,690
After this there will be no turning back. If someone...

929
01:07:39,725 --> 01:07:41,516
Do you think you are the only journalist here?

930
01:07:42,145 --> 01:07:44,275
We are all determined.

931
01:07:45,232 --> 01:07:47,892
Open the door.

932
01:08:07,022 --> 01:08:09,483
Do you want them to shut us down?

933
01:08:09,518 --> 01:08:13,768
Boss, aren't we journalists?

934
01:08:13,774 --> 01:08:17,894
We shouldn't count people...

935
01:08:18,441 --> 01:08:22,521
...what is happening and why?

936
01:08:22,556 --> 01:08:24,607
And what will happen then?

937
01:08:25,564 --> 01:08:29,654
They will shut us down and arrest us.

938
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:31,981
get them out of here.

939
01:08:33,895 --> 01:08:35,645
let me go Boss! Boss!

940
01:08:40,441 --> 01:08:43,401
Is this going to stop the bullets?

941
01:08:44,028 --> 01:08:47,858
Of course not. It is so that the light is not seen.

942
01:08:47,893 --> 01:08:49,062
Clear.

943
01:08:49,981 --> 01:08:51,481
The news will start.

944
01:08:51,979 --> 01:08:55,989
Why bother looking at that shit?

945
01:08:56,235 --> 01:08:59,485
Who knows, maybe today they will say something.

946
01:09:00,613 --> 01:09:02,363
I doubt it.

947
01:09:05,238 --> 01:09:06,838
- The riots in Gwangju... - That's it.

948
01:09:06,887 --> 01:09:08,706
...have not yet been contained.

949
01:09:08,741 --> 01:09:10,525
- I bring fruit. - Silence.

950
01:09:10,692 --> 01:09:16,242
Radical students are gathering...

951
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:20,609
...to spread unsubstantiated rumors.

952
01:09:20,612 --> 01:09:24,862
So far one civilian and 5 members of the army have been killed.

953
01:09:25,819 --> 01:09:26,989
Damn bastards.

954
01:09:27,024 --> 01:09:28,024
Honey!

955
01:09:28,026 --> 01:09:31,526
How can they say that? Many people have died today.

956
01:09:31,772 --> 01:09:34,362
Can they lie like that on the news?

957
01:09:35,030 --> 01:09:37,860
Why do we have to see this garbage?

958
01:09:37,947 --> 01:09:40,067
My blood boil.

959
01:09:41,563 --> 01:09:42,823
They have not told the truth.

960
01:09:45,611 --> 01:09:49,911
As soon as I return to Japan, everything will come out.

961
01:09:50,407 --> 01:09:51,947
The whole world will see it.

962
01:09:54,823 --> 01:09:57,653
Kim will take me to the airport.

963
01:10:00,657 --> 01:10:04,737
Without him, I would never have made it to Gwangju.

964
01:10:08,569 --> 01:10:12,909
You can broadcast it when you get to Japan with the help of Mr. Kim.

965
01:10:13,695 --> 01:10:18,915
And it also helped him pass the blockade of the roads.

966
01:10:20,619 --> 01:10:23,989
They are amazing. Both.

967
01:10:25,445 --> 01:10:28,695
Well, a taxi driver must go where his client says...

968
01:10:28,730 --> 01:10:29,955
...don't worry.

969
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:32,280
Tomorrow I take him directly to the airport.

970
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:33,697
Airport, yes?

971
01:10:34,695 --> 01:10:38,075
I beg you both...

972
01:10:38,741 --> 01:10:40,911
...go all the way.

973
01:10:40,950 --> 01:10:44,410
I ask you on my knees.

974
01:10:44,487 --> 01:10:47,457
In that I am an expert.

975
01:10:48,282 --> 01:10:49,742
On knees.

976
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:51,704
Forget it.

977
01:10:51,739 --> 01:10:55,369
Instead, sing us a song. She is going to a singing contest.

978
01:10:55,404 --> 01:10:58,285
We will judge if you deserve the prize. Sings.

979
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:00,163
- Nothing about that. - Please.

980
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:02,990
I do not sing. I play the guitar.

981
01:11:03,328 --> 01:11:04,868
Is the same.

982
01:11:06,116 --> 01:11:07,456
Forward.

983
01:11:12,081 --> 01:11:14,331
What do I sing?

984
01:11:31,324 --> 01:11:36,164
What am I going to do if you leave me?

985
01:11:37,328 --> 01:11:42,588
How am I going to live without you?

986
01:11:44,162 --> 01:11:46,043
what? Why do you hit the gong?

987
01:11:46,078 --> 01:11:51,418
They are going to demonstrate against you so that you stop singing.

988
01:11:51,873 --> 01:11:55,413
I already told you that I play the guitar. But I'm not that bad either.

989
01:11:55,952 --> 01:11:57,542
I shouldn't have asked her to sing.

990
01:11:57,749 --> 01:11:58,959
Is it a new song?

991
01:12:02,245 --> 01:12:04,245
I guess I'm not good at it.

992
01:12:05,502 --> 01:12:07,872
Of course, a singer you are not.

993
01:12:11,786 --> 01:12:14,126
But there is something that catches my attention.

994
01:12:14,161 --> 01:12:15,914
see? I told him.

995
01:12:16,043 --> 01:12:19,583
He looks a lot like your brother.

996
01:12:19,618 --> 01:12:22,248
- That is. - Yes, they look alike.

997
01:12:22,283 --> 01:12:24,166
- �A Sang-chul? - S�.

998
01:12:25,204 --> 01:12:26,454
to whom?

999
01:12:28,002 --> 01:12:30,132
How have I not seen it before?

1000
01:12:31,078 --> 01:12:33,852
I have a little brother.

1001
01:12:33,887 --> 01:12:36,626
You look a lot like him.

1002
01:12:37,163 --> 01:12:38,837
What do you think? Do we look alike?

1003
01:12:38,872 --> 01:12:40,582
- What does it say? -He looks like my husband.

1004
01:12:40,617 --> 01:12:41,641
They look alike.

1005
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:43,500
I look like Peter.

1006
01:12:46,085 --> 01:12:47,255
What is that?

1007
01:12:49,083 --> 01:12:50,293
What is that noise?

1008
01:13:00,422 --> 01:13:03,962
Over there is the television station.

1009
01:13:04,707 --> 01:13:05,877
Yes, I think so.

1010
01:13:05,912 --> 01:13:10,547
People are going to the station.

1011
01:13:10,791 --> 01:13:13,631
All taxi drivers go there.

1012
01:13:13,959 --> 01:13:16,509
- Really? - See you there.

1013
01:13:17,795 --> 01:13:21,085
Night of May 20, 1980. Near the MBC TV station.

1014
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:58,420
Abroad. Get the radio.

1015
01:14:27,511 --> 01:14:28,761
Jae-sik.

1016
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:41,010
Careful.

1017
01:14:41,589 --> 01:14:43,889
They are plainclothes soldiers.

1018
01:14:45,174 --> 01:14:46,424
how? Soldiers?

1019
01:14:58,553 --> 01:14:59,973
Red bastards!

1020
01:15:27,347 --> 01:15:30,017
Hide upstairs. I grab it.

1021
01:15:30,703 --> 01:15:32,263
fast.

1022
01:15:49,846 --> 01:15:51,096
Where is he?

1023
01:15:52,354 --> 01:15:55,854
This is not why he has come.

1024
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:06,980
Hello.

1025
01:16:09,887 --> 01:16:12,227
I know they are there.

1026
01:16:13,434 --> 01:16:14,814
sir.

1027
01:16:16,602 --> 01:16:19,562
If you give me the camera and the film...

1028
01:16:20,398 --> 01:16:21,558
...you two...

1029
01:16:21,728 --> 01:16:22,858
No.

1030
01:16:25,354 --> 01:16:28,024
The three of them, the boy included...

1031
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:30,900
...you can go.

1032
01:16:32,767 --> 01:16:33,857
What does it say?

1033
01:16:45,934 --> 01:16:48,024
I will count to 10.

1034
01:16:49,691 --> 01:16:51,561
You decide...

1035
01:16:53,308 --> 01:16:55,068
...which is the best choice.

1036
01:16:55,397 --> 01:16:56,897
He wants this.

1037
01:16:57,983 --> 01:17:00,523
So he will let us live, and Jae-sik too.

1038
01:17:01,021 --> 01:17:02,151
Give safe.

1039
01:17:02,808 --> 01:17:05,528
We have to give it to him.

1040
01:17:06,146 --> 01:17:07,316
One.

1041
01:17:08,564 --> 01:17:09,814
Two.

1042
01:17:16,226 --> 01:17:17,566
Three.

1043
01:17:19,524 --> 01:17:20,734
Four.

1044
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:23,610
Five.

1045
01:17:25,937 --> 01:17:27,437
- What are you doing? - Six.

1046
01:17:29,274 --> 01:17:30,564
Seven.

1047
01:17:33,230 --> 01:17:34,520
Eight.

1048
01:17:38,435 --> 01:17:39,459
Nine.

1049
01:17:39,494 --> 01:17:40,784
Wait.

1050
01:17:44,151 --> 01:17:47,031
The stranger may be near.

1051
01:17:47,069 --> 01:17:49,899
Let me speak to you in English.

1052
01:17:53,233 --> 01:17:55,533
I will ask him to save me.

1053
01:18:09,698 --> 01:18:11,358
Can you hear me?

1054
01:18:15,613 --> 01:18:18,153
You won't be able to hold it much longer.

1055
01:18:22,815 --> 01:18:24,075
Please...

1056
01:18:25,571 --> 01:18:28,861
...go away and show the world what's going on.

1057
01:18:31,988 --> 01:18:33,488
- Where are you going? - Please.

1058
01:18:33,523 --> 01:18:34,865
We have to give him this.

1059
01:18:37,113 --> 01:18:38,953
They are going up.

1060
01:18:45,783 --> 01:18:46,823
Shit.

1061
01:18:48,072 --> 01:18:49,112
Give me the bag.

1062
01:18:53,118 --> 01:18:54,278
go away.

1063
01:18:54,367 --> 01:18:55,577
I'm fine.

1064
01:18:56,364 --> 01:18:57,444
Over there.

1065
01:18:59,332 --> 01:19:00,692
A �l.

1066
01:19:20,043 --> 01:19:21,303
Ah.

1067
01:20:44,456 --> 01:20:45,916
Where is the fucking reporter?

1068
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:52,420
Where were you going, communist?

1069
01:20:52,828 --> 01:20:55,418
forgive me. I'm not a communist.

1070
01:20:58,584 --> 01:21:01,504
imbecile! Fucking red!

1071
01:21:06,914 --> 01:21:08,454
I'm really not a communist.

1072
01:21:09,213 --> 01:21:12,211
I'm not even from Gwangju. I'm from Seoul.

1073
01:21:12,246 --> 01:21:15,210
10-8, Hwayang-dong 384, Sungdong-gu, Seoul.

1074
01:21:18,654 --> 01:21:19,894
Yes.

1075
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:22,710
I know.

1076
01:21:23,917 --> 01:21:25,417
The taxi driver from Seoul.

1077
01:21:27,086 --> 01:21:30,006
It is the communist who has brought the German reporter.

1078
01:21:30,294 --> 01:21:33,594
The bastard who sells his country for money.

1079
01:21:34,959 --> 01:21:37,919
And he keeps repeating that he is not a communist.

1080
01:21:38,297 --> 01:21:43,797
"I'm not a communist."

1081
01:21:51,674 --> 01:21:53,634
How dare he...

1082
01:22:09,968 --> 01:22:11,338
We have to go.

1083
01:22:21,926 --> 01:22:23,886
God, I was so worried.

1084
01:22:24,213 --> 01:22:28,133
I'm glad they made it back. And Jae-sik?

1085
01:22:29,170 --> 01:22:30,680
Wasn't he with you?

1086
01:23:01,051 --> 01:23:02,301
You know?

1087
01:23:06,136 --> 01:23:09,346
I made money in Saudi Arabia.

1088
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:15,890
But my wife got sick and I spent it in the hospital.

1089
01:23:17,266 --> 01:23:21,226
In the end, my wife insisted that I buy the taxi.

1090
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:26,390
The doctor agreed.

1091
01:23:30,223 --> 01:23:32,843
So I could take care of my daughter.

1092
01:23:39,096 --> 01:23:42,476
We could have tried other treatments...

1093
01:23:47,308 --> 01:23:51,558
...but I didn't argue. That's how I am.

1094
01:23:53,972 --> 01:23:56,852
We have to go on living, right?

1095
01:24:01,763 --> 01:24:05,603
After my wife died, I got drunk every day.

1096
01:24:14,722 --> 01:24:20,022
One day I woke up...

1097
01:24:25,892 --> 01:24:32,102
...and my daughter was crying clinging to her mother's clothes.

1098
01:24:40,099 --> 01:24:42,189
You must miss her a lot.

1099
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:52,940
I stopped drinking that day.

1100
01:24:57,392 --> 01:25:01,352
I'm all you have.

1101
01:26:10,357 --> 01:26:11,737
What does he do?

1102
01:26:14,113 --> 01:26:17,573
The soldiers look for a taxi from Seoul.

1103
01:26:17,859 --> 01:26:21,029
He should have warned that he was leaving. He doesn't even know the roads.

1104
01:26:21,355 --> 01:26:24,365
Take this and...

1105
01:26:28,229 --> 01:26:33,279
These are hidden paths out of Gwangju.

1106
01:26:35,484 --> 01:26:38,744
And the reporter has asked me to give you this.

1107
01:26:39,488 --> 01:26:41,648
How am I going to accept it?

1108
01:26:41,777 --> 01:26:42,777
what?

1109
01:26:43,276 --> 01:26:46,576
If a taxi driver takes a passenger, he must accept the money.

1110
01:26:46,613 --> 01:26:48,533
Take it.

1111
01:26:49,242 --> 01:26:51,202
I can't get that money.

1112
01:26:51,238 --> 01:26:54,488
Just repairing the car is going to cost you a lot.

1113
01:26:54,523 --> 01:26:56,946
Don't argue and take it.

1114
01:26:59,152 --> 01:27:00,452
Come on, go away.

1115
01:27:00,860 --> 01:27:04,070
Yes, daughter, she's been waiting a long time.

1116
01:27:06,615 --> 01:27:09,945
I'm sorry. Very sorry.

1117
01:27:13,868 --> 01:27:15,658
why?

1118
01:27:16,074 --> 01:27:18,074
The ones who should be sorry are those sons of bitches.

1119
01:27:27,076 --> 01:27:30,496
How good it does.

1120
01:27:35,327 --> 01:27:39,407
Come visit us one day with your daughter.

1121
01:27:39,993 --> 01:27:42,913
We will go on a picnic with my son.

1122
01:27:45,070 --> 01:27:46,580
take care.

1123
01:27:51,073 --> 01:27:52,533
Take care of yourself.

1124
01:28:49,081 --> 01:28:51,081
It will take me an hour to fix it.

1125
01:28:51,499 --> 01:28:53,369
Don't just stand there.

1126
01:28:53,578 --> 01:28:58,088
There is a celebration for Buddha's birthday. I took a turn.

1127
01:28:58,123 --> 01:28:59,622
Go take a look.

1128
01:28:59,750 --> 01:29:00,910
Can I make a phone call?

1129
01:29:15,236 --> 01:29:16,340
hello?

1130
01:29:16,375 --> 01:29:18,125
Dong-su, is my daughter there?

1131
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:19,685
Where have you been?

1132
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:21,175
is he with you?

1133
01:29:21,210 --> 01:29:24,290
He just fell asleep. Shall I wake her up?

1134
01:29:24,325 --> 01:29:26,127
No, let him sleep.

1135
01:29:26,745 --> 01:29:28,085
ok?

1136
01:29:28,544 --> 01:29:31,624
If it worries you so much, why haven't you come?

1137
01:29:32,580 --> 01:29:34,290
Have you got the money?

1138
01:29:34,325 --> 01:29:35,499
Give me the phone.

1139
01:29:36,248 --> 01:29:39,048
Where has he gone?

1140
01:29:39,703 --> 01:29:40,793
Well...

1141
01:29:42,332 --> 01:29:44,632
I'm in the country and the car has broken down.

1142
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:49,302
I left 2,000 won in the drawer. Give them to Eun-jung.

1143
01:29:49,337 --> 01:29:54,087
He's been waiting all night for him. Why do you make promises?

1144
01:29:54,122 --> 01:29:56,000
Give me the phone.

1145
01:29:56,498 --> 01:30:00,468
Are you coming back soon? We talk then.

1146
01:30:19,417 --> 01:30:20,507
Hello.

1147
01:30:24,464 --> 01:30:26,004
How old is your daughter?

1148
01:30:26,039 --> 01:30:26,805
eleven.

1149
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:29,550
How about these?

1150
01:30:29,668 --> 01:30:34,638
They are sturdy and pretty. Mothers love them.

1151
01:30:34,713 --> 01:30:36,173
They are very popular.

1152
01:30:38,419 --> 01:30:42,719
At 11 years old I will wear a size 32.

1153
01:30:42,754 --> 01:30:43,836
33.

1154
01:30:44,634 --> 01:30:46,558
The 32 is too small for him.

1155
01:30:46,593 --> 01:30:51,473
What a considerate father. He knows the size of his daughter.

1156
01:30:52,926 --> 01:30:55,176
Those are a bit expensive.

1157
01:31:01,629 --> 01:31:02,929
A bowl of noodles, please.

1158
01:31:08,094 --> 01:31:10,844
Haven't you gone to collect the bills?

1159
01:31:10,879 --> 01:31:13,181
It has been a waste of time.

1160
01:31:13,587 --> 01:31:14,967
Another bottle of soju.

1161
01:31:15,002 --> 01:31:15,886
Go.

1162
01:31:15,921 --> 01:31:18,256
Don't people pay?

1163
01:31:18,764 --> 01:31:20,764
I haven't even been able to enter Gwangju.

1164
01:31:21,261 --> 01:31:24,641
They say they have killed people there.

1165
01:31:25,217 --> 01:31:26,597
Have they killed people?

1166
01:31:26,756 --> 01:31:30,966
Yes, the army has stormed the city and caused chaos.

1167
01:31:30,972 --> 01:31:31,922
What does it say?

1168
01:31:31,932 --> 01:31:33,382
I don't know for sure...

1169
01:31:33,508 --> 01:31:38,758
...but they say they have killed many people and arrested many more.

1170
01:31:38,763 --> 01:31:41,093
It is not so.

1171
01:31:41,421 --> 01:31:45,931
Innocent soldiers have been killed by protesters.

1172
01:31:45,966 --> 01:31:49,075
No, they have seen it.

1173
01:31:49,110 --> 01:31:52,185
The news has said it.

1174
01:31:52,473 --> 01:31:56,433
And they were not students but trained communists.

1175
01:31:56,468 --> 01:31:58,767
They have even brought in gangsters from Seoul.

1176
01:31:59,095 --> 01:32:02,345
really? Is that what they said on the news?

1177
01:32:02,882 --> 01:32:04,302
Yes.

1178
01:32:04,391 --> 01:32:07,301
And it is also in the newspaper. It occupies a whole page.

1179
01:32:07,308 --> 01:32:11,848
If you want to demonstrate, why don't you do it in Seoul?

1180
01:32:11,883 --> 01:32:14,515
"Protests in Gwangju" They don't let me work like this.

1181
01:32:17,389 --> 01:32:21,229
Rebel groups and rioters...

1182
01:32:50,139 --> 01:32:55,019
It seems that he is hungry. Take this too.

1183
01:33:05,055 --> 01:33:07,815
It's delicious. Delicious.

1184
01:33:16,264 --> 01:33:18,224
Cab. Cab.

1185
01:33:24,597 --> 01:33:26,607
How beautiful.

1186
01:33:28,263 --> 01:33:31,773
I always buy him sneakers. She has never had nice shoes.

1187
01:33:32,310 --> 01:33:34,270
They are going to love them.

1188
01:33:39,644 --> 01:33:44,354
# The river water flows #

1189
01:33:45,018 --> 01:33:48,268
# Under the Third Han River Bridge #

1190
01:33:49,934 --> 01:33:54,984
# Like a bird, like the wind #

1191
01:33:55,769 --> 01:33:59,029
# keep flowing #

1192
01:33:59,476 --> 01:34:04,236
# Yesterday I saw you again #

1193
01:34:05,101 --> 01:34:10,111
# And we took a solemn oath #

1194
01:34:10,936 --> 01:34:15,156
# In the morning we would take the first train #

1195
01:34:19,147 --> 01:34:24,317
# And we would go together #

1196
01:34:43,815 --> 01:34:46,655
Eun-jung, what do I do?

1197
01:34:47,771 --> 01:34:49,031
What do I do?

1198
01:35:10,899 --> 01:35:12,649
Another call, please.

1199
01:35:14,776 --> 01:35:16,026
Are you awake?

1200
01:35:16,445 --> 01:35:18,655
Dad, aren't we going on a picnic?

1201
01:35:18,981 --> 01:35:22,281
Sorry, I have to do something.

1202
01:35:22,989 --> 01:35:24,739
We will go another day.

1203
01:35:26,116 --> 01:35:27,446
when?

1204
01:35:29,364 --> 01:35:33,494
I have left behind a client.

1205
01:35:34,698 --> 01:35:37,578
He needs me urgently.

1206
01:35:38,784 --> 01:35:41,553
As soon as I get it to its destination, I'm going home.

1207
01:35:41,588 --> 01:35:44,323
Be good and don't fight with Sang-gu.

1208
01:35:59,035 --> 01:36:07,035
Until Mount Baekdu erodes and the sea dries up...

1209
01:36:10,745 --> 01:36:18,745
God will protect our country.

1210
01:36:28,449 --> 01:36:29,579
Where has he gone?

1211
01:36:30,246 --> 01:36:31,366
To hospital.

1212
01:36:32,535 --> 01:36:33,785
�Al hospital?

1213
01:37:13,616 --> 01:37:15,206
Why has he come back?

1214
01:37:40,623 --> 01:37:43,623
The soldiers dragged him away...

1215
01:37:46,078 --> 01:37:49,628
...and died on the way.

1216
01:37:51,452 --> 01:37:54,792
They left him lying in a rice field.

1217
01:37:56,169 --> 01:37:58,589
There are not enough coffins in Gwangju.

1218
01:38:00,165 --> 01:38:04,125
Some students have gone for more.

1219
01:38:46,131 --> 01:38:47,461
What are you doing sitting there?

1220
01:38:50,299 --> 01:38:52,669
You have to record all this.

1221
01:38:59,550 --> 01:39:01,840
He promised to tell the world.

1222
01:39:03,048 --> 01:39:07,638
You have to broadcast it for people to see.

1223
01:39:09,381 --> 01:39:11,171
You are a journalist. Record this.

1224
01:39:12,259 --> 01:39:15,299
Jae-sik, and this too.

1225
01:39:16,045 --> 01:39:17,175
Here.

1226
01:40:01,674 --> 01:40:03,384
Open your eyes.

1227
01:40:08,757 --> 01:40:10,967
How can you leave me?

1228
01:40:14,301 --> 01:40:16,971
And taking our son inside!

1229
01:40:28,716 --> 01:40:30,136
Make way.

1230
01:40:30,557 --> 01:40:33,267
This way, doctor, please.

1231
01:40:33,302 --> 01:40:34,595
They have shot him.

1232
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:38,970
What do we do?

1233
01:40:39,219 --> 01:40:42,890
They are really trying to kill us.

1234
01:40:42,925 --> 01:40:45,015
People were singing the national anthem...

1235
01:40:45,433 --> 01:40:47,891
...and the army opened fire.

1236
01:40:47,926 --> 01:40:50,349
They have shot a lot of people.

1237
01:40:50,637 --> 01:40:52,727
We have to get there.

1238
01:40:53,225 --> 01:40:55,345
You guys go to Seoul, quick.

1239
01:40:55,973 --> 01:40:57,223
I'm going with you.

1240
01:40:57,722 --> 01:41:00,972
Mr. Kim, go to Seoul. I have to keep recording.

1241
01:41:02,227 --> 01:41:03,637
He has already paid me.

1242
01:41:04,186 --> 01:41:05,556
Let's go together.

1243
01:41:05,934 --> 01:41:07,264
I taxi driver...

1244
01:41:07,681 --> 01:41:09,141
...you are a taxi customer.

1245
01:41:10,009 --> 01:41:11,019
yes?

1246
01:41:11,637 --> 01:41:13,017
OK. Together.

1247
01:41:50,143 --> 01:41:51,897
Dear neighbors of Gwangju.

1248
01:41:51,932 --> 01:41:53,492
Stay at home. Don't believe the rumours.

1249
01:41:54,599 --> 01:41:55,893
You have to go to the hospital.

1250
01:41:55,928 --> 01:41:57,187
Keep your composure.

1251
01:42:06,807 --> 01:42:09,567
Why are they shooting at us?

1252
01:42:17,478 --> 01:42:19,358
Don't go out

1253
01:42:24,522 --> 01:42:26,062
Shit, look.

1254
01:42:27,608 --> 01:42:29,688
What is happening?

1255
01:42:33,942 --> 01:42:35,562
Over there. They have shot him.

1256
01:43:08,311 --> 01:43:09,821
Still.

1257
01:43:34,358 --> 01:43:36,568
How can they shoot people?

1258
01:43:39,651 --> 01:43:41,321
How can they do this to us?

1259
01:43:41,531 --> 01:43:43,491
How many times do they go now?

1260
01:43:44,239 --> 01:43:46,201
They want to kill us all.

1261
01:43:46,236 --> 01:43:49,866
We cannot leave the wounded.

1262
01:43:50,403 --> 01:43:55,323
Let's mess with the taxis.

1263
01:43:56,277 --> 01:43:57,487
Wait.

1264
01:44:01,891 --> 01:44:03,171
Tom.

1265
01:44:04,989 --> 01:44:08,029
I am a good driver. Let's go together.

1266
01:44:38,869 --> 01:44:40,239
Look. The taxis.

1267
01:45:33,578 --> 01:45:34,748
Thank you.

1268
01:45:56,917 --> 01:45:58,127
Young-pyo.

1269
01:45:59,704 --> 01:46:02,044
- Young-pyo. - Are you okay?

1270
01:46:02,582 --> 01:46:03,754
Get down.

1271
01:46:03,789 --> 01:46:05,039
We are going to help them.

1272
01:46:06,577 --> 01:46:09,337
Let's save the wounded. Come on.

1273
01:46:16,458 --> 01:46:18,958
- Quiet. - Come here.

1274
01:46:20,875 --> 01:46:21,955
ok?

1275
01:46:23,043 --> 01:46:24,463
Aid.

1276
01:46:29,996 --> 01:46:32,416
Kill him here.

1277
01:46:33,663 --> 01:46:34,833
Carefully.

1278
01:46:55,463 --> 01:46:57,253
Aid.

1279
01:46:57,670 --> 01:46:58,880
One second.

1280
01:48:51,847 --> 01:48:53,307
They have to go now.

1281
01:48:53,803 --> 01:48:55,053
They are getting closer.

1282
01:48:55,088 --> 01:48:57,893
They must leave now or it will be impossible.

1283
01:48:58,339 --> 01:49:00,639
We take care of this.

1284
01:49:01,058 --> 01:49:05,977
Go away and prove them lying.

1285
01:49:06,012 --> 01:49:09,932
We can't, but you can. Please.

1286
01:49:15,174 --> 01:49:18,144
fast. Things are going from bad to worse.

1287
01:50:23,770 --> 01:50:25,690
We must go, Mr. Kim.

1288
01:50:52,396 --> 01:50:53,686
Lock all controls.

1289
01:51:10,438 --> 01:51:11,688
Can you get us out?

1290
01:51:14,396 --> 01:51:15,486
Don't worry.

1291
01:51:16,982 --> 01:51:19,272
I will take you to the airport no matter what.

1292
01:52:06,897 --> 01:52:08,237
Good afternoon.

1293
01:52:09,814 --> 01:52:10,984
�A th�nd of?

1294
01:52:11,482 --> 01:52:13,232
I'm taking a client to Seoul.

1295
01:52:13,267 --> 01:52:14,401
Is it a seoul taxi?

1296
01:52:14,491 --> 01:52:15,861
No, de Gwangju.

1297
01:52:18,108 --> 01:52:19,278
Where do you live?

1298
01:52:20,774 --> 01:52:21,908
why?

1299
01:52:21,943 --> 01:52:24,073
Answer, you moron.

1300
01:52:24,821 --> 01:52:26,861
And why doesn't he have a Gwangju accent?

1301
01:52:28,196 --> 01:52:30,366
I moved here recently.

1302
01:52:31,234 --> 01:52:34,154
What's up? Why are they stopping us?

1303
01:52:38,909 --> 01:52:40,989
, boy. What does this idiot say?

1304
01:52:43,613 --> 01:52:44,943
�A th�nd of?

1305
01:52:45,899 --> 01:52:46,989
I've come to do business...

1306
01:52:47,024 --> 01:52:50,119
...but Gwangju has become dangerous. Does he know about the riots?

1307
01:52:50,487 --> 01:52:52,407
That's why I'm going to Seoul.

1308
01:52:52,943 --> 01:52:55,243
He is a businessman fleeing the riots.

1309
01:53:02,485 --> 01:53:04,285
Out of the car, both of you.

1310
01:53:04,534 --> 01:53:06,904
I don't understand. What's the problem?

1311
01:53:07,820 --> 01:53:08,910
Out now.

1312
01:53:09,529 --> 01:53:13,239
He is not going to get away because he is a foreigner. Out.

1313
01:53:34,907 --> 01:53:36,207
Open the trunk.

1314
01:54:00,872 --> 01:54:02,992
They are memories.

1315
01:54:03,159 --> 01:54:04,869
Buddha's birthday.

1316
01:54:35,169 --> 01:54:37,229
Let them pass.

1317
01:54:39,827 --> 01:54:42,247
Sergeant, we have orders to detain all foreigners.

1318
01:54:42,282 --> 01:54:44,875
He is not a journalist and the taxi is not from Seoul.

1319
01:54:45,751 --> 01:54:46,751
let them pass

1320
01:54:50,876 --> 01:54:52,336
I said come on.

1321
01:54:53,354 --> 01:54:54,864
Yes, sir.

1322
01:55:22,048 --> 01:55:24,368
But they said to stop all taxis with foreigners.

1323
01:55:24,415 --> 01:55:25,785
Block the way.

1324
01:55:34,917 --> 01:55:37,257
A-34, A-34. Car with foreigner on the run.

1325
01:55:37,292 --> 01:55:38,754
Registration number 0310.

1326
01:55:39,461 --> 01:55:41,791
A-34, A-34. Car with foreigner on the run.

1327
01:55:41,826 --> 01:55:44,628
Registration number 0310.

1328
01:57:03,804 --> 01:57:05,264
How exciting.

1329
01:57:15,553 --> 01:57:16,723
Trample them.

1330
01:57:30,350 --> 01:57:31,430
bastards!

1331
01:57:32,059 --> 01:57:33,259
shoot them.

1332
01:57:34,407 --> 01:57:35,867
Shit.

1333
01:57:45,555 --> 01:57:46,675
accelerate.

1334
01:57:46,884 --> 01:57:48,594
Don't worry about me.

1335
01:58:23,470 --> 01:58:26,060
You'll see, sons of bitches.

1336
01:58:49,688 --> 01:58:51,268
What's going on back there?

1337
01:59:10,019 --> 01:59:11,439
I'm sorry.

1338
01:59:28,689 --> 01:59:30,309
take care.

1339
01:59:30,688 --> 01:59:32,478
Don't worry about us.

1340
02:00:03,150 --> 02:00:04,360
Step deep.

1341
02:00:04,938 --> 02:00:05,938
Step deep.

1342
02:01:52,700 --> 02:01:55,763
We're looking everywhere, don't worry.

1343
02:01:55,798 --> 02:01:58,826
He just called the airport and booked a flight.

1344
02:02:00,322 --> 02:02:01,706
Commander, we've found it.

1345
02:02:01,741 --> 02:02:04,081
He has booked the flight to Japan for tomorrow at 10:00.

1346
02:02:05,117 --> 02:02:06,537
Yes, sir.

1347
02:02:06,572 --> 02:02:07,736
Hello.

1348
02:02:09,863 --> 02:02:10,863
�Se�or Hinzpeter?

1349
02:02:10,873 --> 02:02:11,983
Yes.

1350
02:02:13,699 --> 02:02:17,909
Don't have a flight booked for tomorrow at 10?

1351
02:02:17,944 --> 02:02:20,038
Yes, but here I am.

1352
02:02:20,073 --> 02:02:25,123
I would like to get on the first plane to Japan. In first class.

1353
02:03:09,458 --> 02:03:10,538
For his daughter.

1354
02:03:11,577 --> 02:03:12,877
Is it for me?

1355
02:03:13,594 --> 02:03:14,804
Thank you.

1356
02:03:16,003 --> 02:03:17,753
Please write me down your phone number.

1357
02:03:18,089 --> 02:03:19,213
how?

1358
02:03:19,248 --> 02:03:21,958
The taxi. I would like to pay you for the damages.

1359
02:03:23,206 --> 02:03:26,256
As soon as the news is broadcast, I will return to Korea.

1360
02:03:26,752 --> 02:03:28,462
I'll call him then.

1361
02:03:32,877 --> 02:03:35,047
I forgot to buy tobacco.

1362
02:03:36,711 --> 02:03:38,461
Please.

1363
02:03:48,961 --> 02:03:50,541
Sa-bok cigarettes.

1364
02:03:55,086 --> 02:03:56,126
Here you go.

1365
02:04:06,756 --> 02:04:08,256
OK right.

1366
02:04:12,460 --> 02:04:13,590
You are a good man.

1367
02:04:14,998 --> 02:04:16,168
You've done a good job.

1368
02:04:22,881 --> 02:04:25,381
You... You good job too.

1369
02:04:27,468 --> 02:04:30,258
Learn Korean before you go back.

1370
02:04:31,174 --> 02:04:33,844
Come back speak Korean, okay?

1371
02:04:34,559 --> 02:04:36,119
OK.

1372
02:04:37,856 --> 02:04:39,426
go away

1373
02:05:43,257 --> 02:05:44,937
The curfew is about to begin.

1374
02:05:45,096 --> 02:05:48,346
Did your father leave because he was poor?

1375
02:05:50,262 --> 02:05:53,512
Sang-gu, don't bother your friend.

1376
02:05:53,677 --> 02:05:56,637
But she hit me first.

1377
02:05:56,672 --> 02:05:58,473
How are you like that?

1378
02:05:59,132 --> 02:06:01,842
Eun-jung, come to dinner. Happens.

1379
02:06:35,809 --> 02:06:36,969
Daddy!

1380
02:06:39,845 --> 02:06:40,935
Eun-jung.

1381
02:06:50,684 --> 02:06:52,184
I'm sorry.

1382
02:06:53,012 --> 02:06:54,812
You've waited so long for me...

1383
02:06:56,471 --> 02:06:59,691
Why are you crying?

1384
02:07:06,641 --> 02:07:07,811
Dad.

1385
02:07:08,559 --> 02:07:14,059
It doesn't look like the democratic revolt is going to end anytime soon...

1386
02:07:14,063 --> 02:07:16,353
...from the Korean city of Gwangju.

1387
02:07:16,388 --> 02:07:21,141
Looking at the wounded...

1388
02:07:21,148 --> 02:07:27,988
...we realize the violence exerted against the demonstrators.

1389
02:07:28,181 --> 02:07:33,941
The army has blockaded the city and cut the telephone lines.

1390
02:07:34,813 --> 02:07:38,566
According to military sources, as of Wednesday...

1391
02:07:38,601 --> 02:07:41,903
...9 people had died and some 60 were injured.

1392
02:07:41,938 --> 02:07:45,398
However, the protesters mention much higher figures.

1393
02:07:48,182 --> 02:07:50,142
Are you sure you searched well?

1394
02:07:50,311 --> 02:07:55,071
Yes, there is no taxi driver with this name.

1395
02:07:57,434 --> 02:07:59,234
Kim Sa-bok.

1396
02:08:00,231 --> 02:08:02,191
And the number is false.

1397
02:08:03,189 --> 02:08:05,479
Kim Sa-bok may not be his real name.

1398
02:08:06,396 --> 02:08:10,316
Perhaps it is best not to look for it.

1399
02:08:28,817 --> 02:08:31,157
December 2003.

1400
02:08:47,189 --> 02:08:52,029
It is a great honor to receive this award in Korea.

1401
02:08:53,021 --> 02:08:57,191
I still remember the faces of the people I met in Gwangju...

1402
02:08:57,817 --> 02:09:00,527
...in the spring of 1980.

1403
02:09:02,774 --> 02:09:04,824
And I will never forget them.

1404
02:09:08,779 --> 02:09:13,869
But there is one face in particular that I miss terribly.

1405
02:09:14,942 --> 02:09:19,072
That of my brave friend Kim Sa-bok.

1406
02:09:21,028 --> 02:09:22,368
He is a taxi driver.

1407
02:09:28,949 --> 02:09:30,218
Excuse me.

1408
02:09:30,253 --> 02:09:31,488
Hey, young man.

1409
02:09:31,947 --> 02:09:34,277
Sorry, I only have 10,000 won.

1410
02:09:34,312 --> 02:09:36,405
It's okay.

1411
02:09:38,320 --> 02:09:39,610
Thank you.

1412
02:09:39,645 --> 02:09:40,950
Take care.

1413
02:09:51,699 --> 02:09:53,569
Wait.

1414
02:09:53,907 --> 02:09:57,577
Without him, the news of the Gwangju uprising...

1415
02:09:57,612 --> 02:09:58,774
...would never have come to light.

1416
02:09:58,824 --> 02:09:59,944
Oh.

1417
02:10:01,360 --> 02:10:04,700
I'm afraid my words fail to convey my gratitude...

1418
02:10:05,076 --> 02:10:07,236
...but I always have you in mind.

1419
02:10:07,245 --> 02:10:10,995
Kim, dear friend.

1420
02:10:12,568 --> 02:10:14,028
Thank you.

1421
02:10:15,487 --> 02:10:17,037
I have missed you a lot.

1422
02:10:22,121 --> 02:10:23,661
I will keep waiting.

1423
02:10:25,327 --> 02:10:28,037
I hope to see you soon.

1424
02:10:32,072 --> 02:10:35,622
He said that if it wasn't for Kim Sa-bok's help, he would never have made it...

1425
02:10:35,657 --> 02:10:37,532
...do it and want to see it again.

1426
02:10:37,567 --> 02:10:40,508
I know that I am grateful to you.

1427
02:10:41,074 --> 02:10:42,664
Thanks thanks.

1428
02:10:43,453 --> 02:10:45,663
I also wanted to see you.

1429
02:10:47,159 --> 02:10:48,869
At least I see you here.

1430
02:10:49,705 --> 02:10:52,785
You too have grown old.

1431
02:11:10,746 --> 02:11:12,366
Hello. to where?

1432
02:11:12,373 --> 02:11:13,953
To Gwanghwamun, please.

1433
02:11:14,241 --> 02:11:16,661
A Gwanghwamun, walk.

1434
02:11:50,040 --> 02:11:54,930
With the help of taxi driver Kim Sa-bok, Hinzpeter risked his life...

1435
02:11:54,965 --> 02:12:00,845
...and managed to show the world what happened in Gwangju.

1436
02:12:02,211 --> 02:12:05,441
After what happened, Hinzpeter kept looking for Kim Sa-bok.

1437
02:12:05,537 --> 02:12:09,037
He died without finding it in January 2016.

1438
02:12:14,998 --> 02:12:18,008
Hinzpeter in November 2015.

1439
02:12:19,214 --> 02:12:24,094
It would be truly wonderful if I could meet you again.

1440
02:12:29,413 --> 02:12:34,093
Really. I can't express how happy that would make me.

1441
02:12:43,790 --> 02:12:50,760
If I can find you with this recording...

1442
02:12:51,923 --> 02:12:56,303
...and we can meet again...

1443
02:12:57,589 --> 02:13:00,719
...it will make me very happy.

1444
02:13:00,796 --> 02:13:06,306
I would run to Seoul...

1445
02:13:06,500 --> 02:13:14,500
...so you could take me in your taxi and see the new Korea.

1446
02:13:19,500 --> 02:13:25,500
