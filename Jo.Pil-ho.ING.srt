ANSAN CITY OF HAPPINESS

2
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,031
This is Ansan 2-1, 2464, go ahead.

3
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,325
- We're going through 4-15, over. - Understood.

4
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,338
Turn to 2-1, 2813.

5
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:12,466
1-8, in distance.

6
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:33,737
Good.

7
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:07,729
Damn unfortunate thief.

8
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,112
Motherfucker.

9
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,115
I told you to come right after finishing.

10
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:19,908
I'm sorry.

11
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:23,829
Bring the tools.

12
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,422
What is the total?

13
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:35,590
Twenty-eight thousand.

14
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,844
- Hey. - That?

15
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,513
don't fuck with me One two...

16
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,017
I'm sorry.

17
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,691
Motherfucker. I saw you save more before.

18
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:57,821
I cannot neglect myself for a moment.

19
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,699
You always steal from me, you son of a bitch.

20
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,252
SAL MARINA NATURAL

21
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,632
bring us luck...

22
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,843
Don't do that shit.

23
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,096
What thing? Turn around.

24
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,101
We never got caught thanks to this, asshole.

25
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,771
If you don't listen to me, I'll beat you to the ground.

26
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,564
Yes, sure.

27
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,817
Yes Gi-Chul. Come here.

28
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:36,777
That?

29
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,154
Suck it, idiot.

30
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,491
Get the hell out of the way.

31
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,582
Damn fucking cop.

32
00:04:55,921 --> 00:05:00,342
Jo Pil-ho: The Awakening of Anger

33
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,474
SOOKIE'S - PIG BONE SOUP

34
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,941
Hello. Is Mr. Wong here?

35
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,401
- Who speaks? - I?

36
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:22,489
We did water skiing a while ago. I'm Stephanie.

37
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,116
And with that? Did you sleep with him?

38
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,409
Why do you ask?

39
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:27,369
Yes or no?

40
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,954
Aren't you a prostitute?

41
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,330
I am the wife of that bastard!

42
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,665
Listen, honey.

43
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:36,920
Even if you're the wife, you can't ask if we slept.

44
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,421
Listen to this, whore.

45
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:41,591
Have a little respect.

46
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:45,220
What a stupid thing.

47
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,846
It's ok I understand.

48
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,390
If Mr. Wong comes back,

49
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:53,186
tell him I have the Viagra ready, to call me.

50
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,483
Do you have fun? You like me?

51
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:02,028
Don't ask me to do it again!

52
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:06,908
You must be an actress. You are very good.

53
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:08,785
You were nice.

54
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:17,919
It's me. I'm sending you a number. Get the call log.

55
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,297
That?

56
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,508
I told you before, he's the guy who disappeared with my money.

57
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:27,429
The number is his wife's, and he's going to call him right away.

58
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:28,430
Yeah.

59
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:32,434
Send me a text with the location. Good.

60
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:38,064
The prosecution executed a search and capture process in the Taesung Group

61
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:41,026
and is looking for the missing $780 million

62
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:44,029
which in theory were used as illicit funds.

63
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:50,535
Director Yi-Hyang Jung is under investigation...

64
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,497
Our largest corporation steals like nothing.

65
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,625
Investigation is a political move

66
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:57,834
to smear Taesung Group.

67
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:02,255
We didn't do anything wrong...

68
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,757
Seven hundred and eighty million?

69
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:09,220
Just give me $78,000 and I'll make you loose.

70
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:14,434
ANSAN POLICE STATION, DANWON DISTRICT

71
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:18,271
TRY 1 MACHETE

72
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:19,356
TEAM 2 HOMICIDE

73
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,192
Go ahead, over there.

74
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,903
- These morons! - Hey you!

75
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:28,198
They were hired to make doors, but they made knives.

76
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,034
- What are you saying...? - What the hell is your name?

77
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,207
You Azim! Again here?

78
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,501
Are you running guns now?

79
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:43,880
Fool!

80
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,342
Spit out the gum! How dare you!

81
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,763
Shall.

82
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:54,724
If Internal Affairs finds out, I'm down too.

83
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,226
You had another child, right?

84
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,395
- Idiot. - Another mouth to feed.

85
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,065
Eat the noodles and don't get high.

86
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,275
See you later. Say no to drugs.

87
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:09,572
You said you had a job at a soup shop, but if you smoke pot,

88
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,784
- how do you make me look? - Lord's word.

89
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:13,910
HOLY BIBLE

90
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,957
- Be good. - Amen.

91
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,045
What a sweet asshole.

92
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,339
Hey, Pil-Ho Jo!

93
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,260
Shit.

94
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,179
Ho, Ho, Johnson, shrink dick!

95
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,056
Where are you going?

96
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:39,019
Don't mess with my last name.

97
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,396
- Whoops! - Oh really...

98
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,481
Oh.

99
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:48,153
Honestly, at least wait until the sun goes down.

100
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,113
Do you already do tricks in bright light?

101
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,532
Go touch it to someone else.

102
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,577
Why do you always bother me?

103
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:02,208
You have a very big mouth for someone with such a small penis.

104
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:03,668
Holy shit.

105
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,921
What a dirty mouth.

106
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:11,134
Is Internal Affairs just promoting profanity now?

107
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,969
- That? - Alright.

108
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:18,558
Pil-Ho, this won't be like last time, when you slipped away.

109
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:24,564
I'll even search your anus and send you to Chungsong Jail.

110
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,399
- Oh really? - Yeah.

111
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,694
Too bad my car doesn't have GPS.

112
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:32,697
I wouldn't know how to get there.

113
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:37,077
Remember "Bones of Glass" Gibs, the brittle gangster?

114
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,706
He's been busy ever since he took over Mr. Yeom's building.

115
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,917
But something was smelly, so I investigated

116
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,837
and found out that someone convinced him.

117
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:52,175
A public servant like you, a policeman.

118
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:56,596
That cop even put up $300,000 to buy the building.

119
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,765
What would we have to do?

120
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,893
Lock him up and fuck it. It is not obvious?

121
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:05,980
Hey.

122
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,234
This is not advice

123
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,903
But you can't keep putting on a poker face.

124
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,072
Leave.

125
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,741
Stop fucking around, idiot.

126
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,940
How's the food, damn it?

127
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,067
It will give you a fit. Come and sit down.

128
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,782
imbeciles. They are hungry?

129
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,243
How can they eat now?

130
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,120
Go ahead, eat.

131
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:09,335
They just delivered it. I didn't even dip the chopsticks.

132
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:16,134
As soon as I got your money, they started snooping around.

133
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:21,431
Why does that jerk from Internal Affairs want to eat you alive?

134
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,436
I shouldn't have taken your money.

135
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,395
What the hell?

136
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,690
Let's make a clean slate.

137
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,775
Still, you were going to quit.

138
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,653
Let's sell the building before the AI ​​get any closer

139
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:36,988
and dedicate ourselves to alcohol.

140
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:41,409
With your network and my manpower, there is nothing to fear.

141
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:48,708
Can you get a loan for $200,000?

142
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,418
We have to cover expenses.

143
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:56,215
Two hundred thousand?

144
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,425
Do you think money rains?

145
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,261
Where do I get $200,000, idiot?

146
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,639
Then what do we do?

147
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:06,017
If we can't pay, we will lose all the money.

148
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,479
Our money will be gone! You understand?

149
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:41,678
Are you an Adidas model or something?

150
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,849
How dare you look at me like that?

151
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:03,741
What's wrong with that crazy woman?

152
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,915
Hey, Gi-Chul Han. Gi-Chul Han!

153
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,462
you misunderstood That night I was with Sung-Jin.

154
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,006
- Give me the bag. - Not even in dreams.

155
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:20,425
If you continue like this, ours is over.

156
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,219
- Yeah? We're done then. - Hey!

157
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,513
Let go! Let me!

158
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,724
Do not call me Anymore. I am going to kill you!

159
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,143
Mine! Wait!

160
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,396
Mina Jang, don't go!

161
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,273
Hey!

162
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:39,235
It is a misunderstanding! Mine please!

163
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:57,420
Was she the schoolgirl you mentioned?

164
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:02,175
How does it feel to be beaten up by a girl?

165
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,218
She is not like that.

166
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:07,096
How not, idiot.

167
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,599
- What is the total? - Twenty-eight thousand.

168
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:13,895
- So $59,000 combined? - Yeah.

169
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,064
Fiftynine thousand...

170
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,483
Why suddenly? Something happens?

171
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:25,156
Hey. Let's do one more job.

172
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,285
A big one.

173
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,351
It's an untraceable phone.

174
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,562
The alarm will stop working at 3:00. Then we'll go in.

175
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,902
Brother, this is not right.

176
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,155
Do you want to rob a police warehouse?

177
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,991
I'm not up to it.

178
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,743
They will give us at least 10 years.

179
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:12,370
Are you afraid?

180
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,998
I became a cop because cops scare me.

181
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,253
Don't worry, they won't catch us.

182
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,133
walking.

183
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,223
I'll be right back, boss.

184
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:35,893
Are you going on a trip, asshole?

185
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,164
Green wire, green wire...

186
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:12,263
Huh?

187
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,767
Why it takes so long?

188
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,238
CALLING...

189
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:37,914
RECENT CALLS

190
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,665
CALLING...

191
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,228
Report your status.

192
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,855
2-1 turn, change.

193
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,441
You cut the green, didn't you?

194
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:10,905
- By the way, I'm color blind, boss. - Yes, and?

195
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,782
I can't tell green from red.

196
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,033
And?

197
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,249
- What did you say? - Well...

198
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,669
They were both brown, so I cut both of them.

199
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,229
Are you crazy?

200
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,153
That?

201
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:55,366
We're fucking ruined!

202
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,326
Shit!

203
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,509
What can I do with him?

204
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,182
Why is he so calm?

205
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,120
Shit.

206
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,346
Hey. Gi-Chul. Gi Chul Han!

207
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,318
Friend! Get out of there!

208
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,030
What the fuck?

209
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,290
What the hell...?

210
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,304
- Are you awake? - What the fuck?

211
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,684
He's in a hospital.

212
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,645
I will look for its guardian.

213
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:38,487
You ran into a fire, and there was an explosion?

214
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:41,198
But was it a police depot?

215
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,200
Yeah.

216
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:45,703
Even a dog would laugh in your face.

217
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,581
Do not believe me.

218
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,374
We have a dead body, idiot!

219
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:53,878
Internal Affairs is reviewing all your calls!

220
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,087
You...

221
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,052
I'm not interested in knowing what happened.

222
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:03,804
But, Pil-Ho,

223
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,516
when you eat pasta and get dirty with sauce,

224
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,519
don't pretend it's something else.

225
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,355
Wipe off the sauce and act like nothing happened.

226
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,485
Back to work.

227
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,573
Damn.

228
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:34,001
- The boss already reviewed it. - That?

229
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:40,549
But I had hidden it!

230
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:57,691
- Did you kill him? - That?

231
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,069
- That guy. - Hear what you say.

232
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:04,365
- You are having fun? - Do not yell at me!

233
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,407
Damn.

234
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:07,952
Curse.

235
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:46,865
Everything burned, sir. What do we do?

236
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:51,412
DISTRICT ATTORNEY

237
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:53,706
Stand up straight.

238
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:58,252
Send a written apology you useless assholes.

239
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,977
Yes, it's me.

240
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,854
Did you verify that everything is gone?

241
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:19,023
Yes, confirmed.

242
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,317
Good job.

243
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,868
I'm sorry.

244
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:33,162
I bother you?

245
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,126
It burned. Can you get it back?

246
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,214
How nice.

247
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:49,136
New facilities and everything.

248
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,515
We treat everyone very well

249
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,310
but it seems they keep reporting poisonings here.

250
00:23:57,227 --> 00:24:00,230
They bite the hand that feeds them.

251
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,652
How much longer?

252
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:07,196
I'm kind of busy.

253
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,198
Two hours?

254
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,121
Two days?

255
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:32,012
Do you know the Chilean dictator, Pinochet?

256
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:36,642
He killed 3,000 people in a week on a soccer field.

257
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,436
Divide that by seven days and you get 428.

258
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:44,108
It killed 428 people per day. It's amazing, isn't it?

259
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,987
414 researchers work here,

260
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,242
he could have killed everyone here in one day.

261
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,369
One day.

262
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:01,375
But does it take two days to get a phone back?

263
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:10,426
Keep going.

264
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,686
This is what happens when a man burns out.

265
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,438
It's not a man, it's a corpse.

266
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,189
A corpse. Yeah.

267
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,944
I had not seen a charred body.

268
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:32,865
Damn bastard, he had to die in there.

269
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:39,288
Have more respect for the deceased. No?

270
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,457
I'm sorry Mr.

271
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:47,463
His airways are clear. He died before the fire.

272
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:50,048
- That? - Look here.

273
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:55,512
A strong trauma. She broke her head.

274
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:57,306
- Before burning. - Aside.

275
00:25:58,432 --> 00:25:59,433
What is this?

276
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,352
So how did he split his head?

277
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:04,313
I do not know? That is his job.

278
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:12,529
Did you find Han's cell phone?

279
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:14,698
I did not see it.

280
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:19,411
With a clear airway, does that mean you didn't suffocate?

281
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:21,747
Is this a homicide?

282
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,773
What is this? That?

283
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:55,572
This is from today.

284
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:04,540
Wait! High!

285
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,260
Those sandals...

286
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:21,431
Shit. Damn.

287
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:29,731
A shot to the head.

288
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:36,113
SORRY FOR MY FAMILY. SORRY FOR THE VICTIMS.

289
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:39,741
Jae-Man Hwang, the owner of the warehouse.

290
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:42,911
He set it on fire to collect the insurance.

291
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,914
But I didn't know there was someone inside.

292
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,920
Did you burn the deposit to collect the insurance?

293
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:53,422
Yes, it seems so.

294
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,053
I'll take care.

295
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:03,765
Yes sir?

296
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:06,768
- I know whose motorcycle it is. - Oh really?

297
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,228
Send it to me by text.

298
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,609
Hwang is dead.

299
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:17,070
Things got complicated!

300
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:22,117
I ran to a public place. Please come find me.

301
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:25,037
The Taesung Group caught Hwang!

302
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,296
Think about it.

303
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:37,382
Hwang was found dead a day after the fire.

304
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:39,801
They don't want to leave traces!

305
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:43,931
I will present myself with evidence as a witness.

306
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:45,974
I have the detonator too.

307
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:53,690
I'll stay here, so call me, okay?

308
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,694
I'm done.

309
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:03,992
Shit!

310
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:06,411
- What the fuck? - What a shame.

311
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:10,123
Give it back to me?

312
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,960
What a work of art.

313
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:14,253
This is very extrange.

314
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:46,827
HOPE PUB

315
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,290
Welcome.

316
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,386
Can I have a beer?

317
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,892
Doesn't a girl work part time here?

318
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:14,396
He makes deliveries on a motorcycle. She has short hair.

319
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:17,649
Out to make a delivery?

320
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:23,447
Aren't you Detective Pil-Ho Jo from the Danwon District?

321
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:28,493
Who are you?

322
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:32,164
It does not remember me?

323
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:33,999
Sorry?

324
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,462
I am Ji-Won Song's father.

325
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,880
¿Ji-Won Song?

326
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:44,426
Forehead...

327
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,178
That scar.

328
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:01,193
Stop crying like a bitch.

329
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,402
I'm sorry.

330
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:03,904
- Hurry up. - Yeah.

331
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:06,656
- Get me water. - Right away!

332
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,657
Moron.

333
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:09,826
...a symbolic uniform for Song's father.

334
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:12,287
Ji-Won Song, victim of the Sewol ferry shipwreck,

335
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:15,791
I dreamed of being a policeman

336
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,584
which caused grief to his own.

337
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:22,672
The police put together this event to comfort his family.

338
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:25,342
The commissioner is coming!

339
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:28,970
- Hey. - Yeah?

340
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,305
Dude, finish now.

341
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:32,391
Send two to the scene and let's go to the funeral.

342
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:33,392
SEWOL FERRY WRECK RESCUE LIST

343
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:35,352
There are more bodies of children. No time for that.

344
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,895
Hey!

345
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:40,315
- What madness! - The boss is looking for you!

346
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,533
What the fuck are you doing?

347
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:54,037
Let me in! Oh my God!

348
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:56,706
What's the matter? Damn!

349
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:00,460
Don't come near!

350
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:02,504
- Why did you arrive so late? - Journalists...

351
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,553
Look here please.

352
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:11,471
Mr Song!

353
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:14,349
Mr Song! This way, sir!

354
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:16,476
Can you look over here?

355
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,687
Here, sir!

356
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:20,605
Mister!

357
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:21,815
Mr Song!

358
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,442
Mr Song!

359
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:39,124
ALTAR IN MEMORY OF THE SEWOL FERRY WRECK

360
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,001
The whole town is in mourning.

361
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:43,628
I saw some officers going to the scene.

362
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:45,464
Shouldn't you go too?

363
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:48,300
I'm too sensitive to go there.

364
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,971
- It's the police. Inspections. - What's that?

365
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:53,889
Open the door.

366
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,682
What do we do?

367
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:58,810
What do you mean by that? I am also a policeman.

368
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:00,270
What's happening?

369
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,857
Mister. What is he doing here?

370
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,360
What do you think I do? God.

371
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:08,695
I'm sorry.

372
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,156
Boss...

373
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,994
I was... Sir, it's not that...

374
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,455
I was going to clean...

375
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,043
She brought me underwear.

376
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,464
- Find them! - Right away!

377
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:31,051
You should have called me. What's going on?

378
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:34,262
The father who received the uniform this morning...

379
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:36,640
- That? He-he left a will and disappeared.

380
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,517
They report that they saw him here.

381
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,644
If he kills himself, we're screwed.

382
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,646
You're right.

383
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,359
Mr Song! Don't do this!

384
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:52,531
- Let me go! - Don't do this!

385
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:54,241
You have to stay calm.

386
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:57,744
Easy with him! Don't hurt him!

387
00:33:57,827 --> 00:34:01,122
- Why can't I kill myself? - Please calm down.

388
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:03,250
We'll take him to the hospital first.

389
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:04,793
- Let's talk. - Grab him!

390
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:12,217
- Oh really? - You must go to the hospital!

391
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,302
He did not live even 20 years.

392
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:19,266
I was 17 years old. She was a girl.

393
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:25,105
- Let's just talk. - Sir, we hear you.

394
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:30,402
We understand how you feel, but you can't do this to us.

395
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,445
Come on, grab it.

396
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:34,239
¡Agárrenlo!

397
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,421
Sir, are you okay?

398
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:52,632
Shit!

399
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,261
Walk him outside!

400
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,847
- Mr. Song, come on. - Enough.

401
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,432
Pilho, are you okay?

402
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,976
- Get up please. - Get up, see.

403
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,355
Let's see.

404
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:09,983
- Motherfucker! - Hey!

405
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,075
Am at home.

406
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:23,288
- Sorry for the mess. - Alright.

407
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,458
Please pass.

408
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,586
No, I have very dirty feet.

409
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,713
Alright. Forward.

410
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,006
Well.

411
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:38,678
Ji Won, do you remember? He brought you the police uniform.

412
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,065
MY DREAM IS TO BE A POLICEMAN.

413
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,109
I found it.

414
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:55,403
It's her. Mina Jang.

415
00:35:56,112 --> 00:36:00,784
They were best friends in elementary school, but she got in trouble.

416
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:03,370
What kind of problems?

417
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:04,913
He lived with his grandmother

418
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:08,166
but he became rebellious when the old woman died.

419
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:11,920
They kicked her out of school, too.

420
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,588
And the motorcycle was stolen?

421
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:18,134
Yes, he stole Ji-Won's clothes, shoes, and a backpack.

422
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,346
But didn't you report it?

423
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,723
She's not a terrible girl.

424
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:27,227
I thought it would be a bad influence on Ji-Won.

425
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:31,815
But he secretly organized birthday parties for my daughter in the basement.

426
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:37,821
Is mine in trouble?

427
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:41,408
No, I need it for a case I'm investigating.

428
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:48,123
Haven't seen this in a while. She keeps it well.

429
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:51,418
- What is this jump rope doing here? - I'm sorry.

430
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,421
- It's for dieting. - That?

431
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:56,589
It will be because I work in a chicken shop,

432
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,676
Ji-Won loved Korean food.

433
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:03,972
He would eat two servings and jump rope to lose weight.

434
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:06,307
I should have eaten less...

435
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,894
She doesn't look fat in the photo.

436
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:13,982
- She was pretty. She put it here. - Yeah.

437
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:18,027
Do you have Mina's phone number?

438
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:19,946
No.

439
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,365
You shouldn't protect her.

440
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:23,825
I don't know, actually.

441
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:30,248
It's not much, but share it with the other agents.

442
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:33,209
There's no need. I feel uncomfortable.

443
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:35,754
Too bad the boys like pizza.

444
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,174
Thank you so much.

445
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,009
Wait...

446
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:42,802
Yeah?

447
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:44,721
If he finds Mina,

448
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:49,642
Can you tell me to return Ji-Won's sportswear?

449
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:54,981
She was wearing it when she drowned on the ferry.

450
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,442
He wanted to burn it in his honor...

451
00:37:58,651 --> 00:37:59,819
...but Mina took her away.

452
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:02,614
He wanted to send her to heaven.

453
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,620
Okay bye.

454
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,672
People are very simple.

455
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:22,550
They use the same password for the cell phone and the cards.

456
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:26,846
You deactivate the phone and use it to go crazy shopping.

457
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:27,931
Game over.

458
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,852
Good job, son of a bitch.

459
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:37,607
Alright?

460
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:39,734
Is very good.

461
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:42,320
Justifies the scar on my forehead.

462
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,656
- You better enjoy it. - Clear.

463
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,742
Good. I have it.

464
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,955
Let's see... What is this?

465
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,289
Oh. An unread text.

466
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:54,249
JIN-GYU SONG Do you know Mina's address?

467
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,291
¿ Jin-Gyu Song?

468
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:56,417
It's not my girl. How will I know?

469
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:01,297
Look for Mina Jang's Facebook, texts, her social networks

470
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:04,175
and transfer the data to your laptop. Do it.

471
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:05,176
Well.

472
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:09,597
Who is she?

473
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,725
Is beautiful.

474
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,187
Heavens.

475
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,608
Enough. It's obscene.

476
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:36,916
Some African tribes believe that by taking a photo

477
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,127
you take the soul of the person.

478
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:42,672
Take pictures of hands or something, not the face.

479
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:45,675
You have no respect for the dead.

480
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:47,010
I'm sorry Mr.

481
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:50,722
I miss the good old days.

482
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:56,603
Now everyone lost their common sense.

483
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:07,906
Mr. Kwon.

484
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:09,908
Yes sir?

485
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:13,953
One misstep and you're finished.

486
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,376
That feels good.

487
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:34,432
Shit. What do you want?

488
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:37,602
I live upstairs. There is a water leak.

489
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,020
- What waste of water? - Enters.

490
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:39,979
Let's see.

491
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:41,022
That?

492
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:50,406
Jin-Gyu Song, where is Mina Jang?

493
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,582
The fire chief is dead

494
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,918
and the detonator also disappeared.

495
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:07,632
With the witness missing, we were ordered to release Director Jung.

496
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:08,925
What I do?

497
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:18,768
You leave nothing to chance.

498
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,354
You killed everyone.

499
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:25,024
Soon you will be attorney general. Let's go out to dinner shortly.

500
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:36,327
The prosecution revoked the arrest of director Jung,

501
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:38,913
and changed the case to an investigation of witnesses.

502
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:44,794
The investigation into the missing $780 million is still pending.

503
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:48,006
Look at these ants trying to survive.

504
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:52,135
Ladies and gentlemen...

505
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:54,303
A desperate fight...

506
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:56,055
Mr. Principal!

507
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:57,849
What do you think of the result?

508
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,308
How does it feel?

509
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:02,770
Did they dismiss the charges?

510
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:06,357
Whose ethical responsibility is for missing funds?

511
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,280
A comment please.

512
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:17,827
Ladies and gentlemen, Taesung Group is the number one corporation in Korea.

513
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:23,041
But the prosecutor decided to roll our integrity through the mud.

514
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:26,919
Taesung

515
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:31,883
offers scholarships to needy students every year.

516
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:38,431
How am I going to stop saying that Korea is a constitutional and democratic nation?

517
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:44,270
As a parent from Korea, I feel very ashamed.

518
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:47,732
Mr. Principal!

519
00:42:55,865 --> 00:43:00,620
Oh! Mr. Kwon, you do well on TV.

520
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,814
Oh! Exploded?

521
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,108
Yeah.

522
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:34,112
You took care of it, but is there another problem?

523
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:36,447
I'm sorry Mr.

524
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:40,076
This phone belonged to the one who died in the mortuary.

525
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,621
Did they send the video from that phone?

526
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:50,044
- Whom? - Two people, sir.

527
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:54,507
The first, Jin-Gyu Song, a three-time convicted felon.

528
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:56,634
- Her name is So-Hee. - Keep going.

529
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,345
She is Mina's minion.

530
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:01,264
- AND? - He's going to be with her.

531
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:02,932
The other?

532
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:04,517
Well...

533
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:09,647
It's police.

534
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:12,150
What an idiot...

535
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:13,442
Mr. Kwon?

536
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:14,652
Yes sir?

537
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:20,825
He's screwed, and he's going to jail by himself.

538
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:32,545
Friendship? What a stupid thing.

539
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:37,675
Stop your friendship nonsense. I'm going.

540
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:41,095
He is in room 6008.

541
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,597
Do you have guys there?

542
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,974
I don't know, I heard TV noise.

543
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:47,727
That?

544
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,353
Nothing, come on.

545
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,274
HOPE PUB

546
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:01,741
Mine Jang! Hey!

547
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:02,909
It's open.

548
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,089
What's happening?

549
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:21,093
- "Friendship" is your code? - That?

550
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:24,388
"Stop that friendship crap" is code for "there's a cop."

551
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:26,724
Of course not.

552
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:28,517
Yeah, sure, asshole.

553
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,356
Hey!

554
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:37,318
Enough! Bitch!

555
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:40,112
Let go! Fool!

556
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:41,322
Let me! What the fuck?

557
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,990
You!

558
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:48,829
High. Come with me.

559
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,207
- Do you remember me? - Who are you?

560
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,042
It hurts me!

561
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:55,795
- I said it hurt! - Hey! Enough!

562
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:57,254
What the hell!

563
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:01,342
- Enough! - Motherfucker!

564
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:02,760
Suéltala!

565
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:06,639
- Runs! - No! I won't leave without you!

566
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:08,724
Hey! Get off me!

567
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:12,812
- Curse! - Let go, idiot!

568
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:14,981
Shit! Hey!

569
00:46:15,064 --> 00:46:17,316
What the fuck are you doing?

570
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,610
What's happening here?

571
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:21,237
Do something with them. Take them off me!

572
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:24,073
- I'll call the police! - Ma'am, I'm a policeman!

573
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:26,659
I am Police!

574
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:37,586
- May I go now? - Sure thanks.

575
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:40,172
- Damn traitor. - Fuck that.

576
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:42,591
See you.

577
00:46:47,096 --> 00:46:49,765
Let's cut it short and get rid of it.

578
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:51,058
Wait.

579
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:53,769
She is sick. Can you let her sit down?

580
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:55,563
As?

581
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:57,565
She is very sick!

582
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:01,652
Sit down.

583
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,743
- Where is the money? - What money?

584
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:12,663
Again,

585
00:47:13,456 --> 00:47:14,373
where is the money?

586
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,501
It wasn't from Gi-Chul.

587
00:47:18,753 --> 00:47:20,963
Where is my $59,000?

588
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:22,965
Don't know. How will I know?

589
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:27,303
- Mina... - Are you okay?

590
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:31,557
You are suspicious. Do you want to go to correctional?

591
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:34,602
For the last time,

592
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:36,312
where is the money?

593
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:46,322
- You're not going to talk? - At home! I hid it there.

594
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:49,200
- Safe? - Is there.

595
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,451
Gather your things.

596
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:53,788
Are you the crooked cop Gi-Chul mentioned?

597
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:54,705
That?

598
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:57,416
He said a policeman made him do the whole scam.

599
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,376
Did he say that?

600
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,753
I won't let it go.

601
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:03,339
I'm going to expose you!

602
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:07,760
Yeah? What a pity. There are no witnesses.

603
00:48:12,473 --> 00:48:13,682
He is dead.

604
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,601
Gi Chul Han is dead.

605
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:23,943
How he died?

606
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:27,113
- That? - Gi-Chul.

607
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:30,282
Who cares?

608
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,953
There's nothing to do.

609
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:38,874
I have a video.

610
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:42,294
- Give me my wallet. - What are you doing?

611
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:45,589
- Gi-Chul sent me a video. - What video? Sit down.

612
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:47,174
- I'll show you! - Damn!

613
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:49,677
- Sit down, Mine. - Stay still.

614
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,387
- I'll show you. - Heavens, damn it!

615
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,430
Stay seated, bitch.

616
00:48:53,514 --> 00:48:54,974
You think I don't know your tricks?

617
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:57,643
You'll call someone to get the bag before I do.

618
00:48:57,726 --> 00:48:59,145
I really have it!

619
00:48:59,228 --> 00:49:01,188
Stay seated!

620
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:11,615
Stay in your fucking chair! How annoying are you, shit!

621
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:14,034
Do you feel like dying or something?

622
00:49:15,703 --> 00:49:17,746
Mine! Are you OK?

623
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:19,373
What's happening?

624
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:20,958
- What the fuck? What happens? - Open your eyes.

625
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:24,170
She's epileptic!

626
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:25,838
You have to lie down!

627
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:28,132
What a fucking mess!

628
00:49:29,258 --> 00:49:33,012
- Come on... - Let her go with this.

629
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,931
Mina, open your eyes.

630
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,185
Reaction to. Look at me.

631
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:42,021
- I do not believe this. - Mine...

632
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:43,480
How are you doing?

633
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,304
- Mine, let's go. - My phone.

634
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:16,847
Come on.

635
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:20,267
Mine, come on. Mine!

636
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:25,231
- We must go! - Shit!

637
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:29,568
Shit.

638
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:41,956
Shit!

639
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:44,458
Damn!

640
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:47,336
THE BOSS

641
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:56,679
We are almost there. Hurry up.

642
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,188
Come on!

643
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:10,943
What's happening?

644
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:15,239
What's going on?

645
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:20,077
My tummy hurts.

646
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:25,291
It will be because of the impact of before. It hurts me a lot.

647
00:51:25,374 --> 00:51:27,751
- Hold on, please. - Mine!

648
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:34,883
Hello?

649
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:39,305
Anyone here? Someone?

650
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:44,643
Aid! Please!

651
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:50,316
Hey, look at this photo.

652
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,651
You declared that you were alone.

653
00:51:52,735 --> 00:51:54,153
But who is next to you?

654
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,823
This?

655
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:04,038
I was driving and saw a foreign worker.

656
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,706
I felt bad and picked it up.

657
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:08,542
Yeah? Where did you pick it up and drop it off?

658
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,127
How will I know?

659
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:14,715
Go to the employment center, you will find many.

660
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:18,177
Don't get smart.

661
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:21,221
You killed Gi-Chul Han and set the place on fire.

662
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:24,433
Stop creating stories and bring me proof. Tests please.

663
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:28,520
The person responsible is dead and left a will. Because you follow me?

664
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:31,857
- I have a witness. - That?

665
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:41,825
We found him hiding in a motel room.

666
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:43,327
- Glad? - Take this off me.

667
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:47,748
Little dick Pil-Ho, you fucking son of a bitch.

668
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:50,417
- Finish it off. - Let go! What did the bitch say?

669
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:52,711
- What the fuck did you tell them? - Hey! Stay away!

670
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:57,216
Come here! What did you say? Fuck off!

671
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,219
- What the fuck did you tell them? - Hey! Don't worry!

672
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:03,222
- You don't know shit! - Come on!

673
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:05,808
Hey!

674
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:11,146
Let me interrupt.

675
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:17,653
Is that Johnson Pil-Ho Detective Jo Pil-Ho?

676
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:24,201
Detective Jo, we're here on the warehouse fire case.

677
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:28,747
The fire ruined the complex next door.

678
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:33,043
However, there was no wind. Weird, no?

679
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:35,462
You have a will.

680
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:38,966
That the owner wanted to collect the insurance?

681
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:42,886
Are you a detective and do you believe that story?

682
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:49,643
Listen, what was in the compound next door?

683
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:51,562
What do I know?

684
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:54,731
Twelve boxes of evidence against the Taesung Group,

685
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:57,526
about 400,000 illegal bond accounts for illicit funds.

686
00:53:57,609 --> 00:53:58,986
You understand?

687
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:02,281
They were key pieces of evidence against Taesung.

688
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:10,456
But some sons of bitches burned them.

689
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:16,712
Then they passed us anonymous information from the fire chief who came.

690
00:54:18,005 --> 00:54:20,632
He said that he and Taesung started the fire.

691
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:25,679
According to him, there was another person in the warehouse.

692
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:29,433
Who was this mysterious man?

693
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:32,436
Gi Chul Han.

694
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:43,697
Motherfucker!

695
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,703
What the fuck?

696
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:03,884
It gets more interesting.

697
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:08,680
Han's phone signal could only output video.

698
00:55:08,764 --> 00:55:10,682
He sent this video just before he died.

699
00:55:10,766 --> 00:55:14,269
Two people, no less, and I tracked them down.

700
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:23,070
One was an untraceable phone bought by a certain Johnson, who is...

701
00:55:24,613 --> 00:55:28,075
You Pil-Ho Johnson!

702
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:38,043
We'll get back to that.

703
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:44,216
But why were you there? Did you steal?

704
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:48,011
Or are you also on Taesung's staff?

705
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:51,390
What's the problem?

706
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:53,809
you are pale

707
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:56,311
He doesn't know how to put on a poker face.

708
00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:02,401
What are you doing?

709
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:04,486
Gi-Chul sent me a video.

710
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:09,116
May I smoke?

711
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:25,841
You're right. I bought the untraceable phone.

712
00:56:28,135 --> 00:56:30,220
Did you hear that, Min-Jae Kim from Internal Affairs?

713
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:36,143
This prosecutor says I didn't burn the place down or kill Han.

714
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,395
Are you recording this?

715
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:42,566
I'm sorry.

716
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:47,446
You know how hard it is to be a homicide cop.

717
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:51,575
I was in the warehouse.

718
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:55,996
Han entered, and the building blew up.

719
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:59,583
I got scared and I went driving,

720
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:03,712
my phone started ringing. Maybe it was the video.

721
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:08,008
I got rid of him and got the hell out of there. That's all.

722
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:12,971
Shit, did I drop it while driving or after?

723
00:57:13,055 --> 00:57:15,474
Who knew that it was so important?

724
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:18,685
Shit. Very sorry.

725
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:21,188
Drive? Humbug.

726
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:23,732
You woke up in a hospital. Are you trying to screw us?

727
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:25,359
Yeah?

728
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,780
I suffered a concussion.

729
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:36,411
NO SIGNAL

730
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:44,086
Wait your turn!

731
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:48,090
You're not that stupid.

732
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:01,770
Mr. Johnson, listen.

733
00:58:02,354 --> 00:58:06,274
They have enough evidence to detain you for ten years.

734
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:11,321
If you leave the force, I can clean this shit up,

735
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:13,573
and you can live as a civilian.

736
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:17,536
Get me that video.

737
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:25,711
Damn.

738
00:58:29,381 --> 00:58:31,049
Mine's address...

739
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:37,014
Curse! Is blocked!

740
00:59:16,428 --> 00:59:17,512
Wait...

741
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:25,228
Please...

742
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:33,987
Sir, I just gave you my ID.

743
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,784
It's Mina's phone.

744
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:53,173
Shit.

745
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:23,036
Shit, I still feel the stun gun.

746
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:47,769
Very good!

747
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:57,195
That's all? Curse.

748
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:10,083
What is this?

749
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:13,336
Isn't that Mina Jang's house?

750
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:15,046
And?

751
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:19,092
I am your teacher at home.

752
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:25,891
- We had a date. - I see.

753
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:32,439
- It should happen. - Alright.

754
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:33,940
Happens.

755
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:38,153
The house is messy.

756
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:41,239
I'm a policeman.

757
01:01:41,323 --> 01:01:43,283
The young woman is in trouble.

758
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,535
That sure doesn't surprise you.

759
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:49,414
I'm done here, but you can stay.

760
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:51,541
What is this?

761
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:57,214
Can I see your phone? Is it from Mina?

762
01:01:57,797 --> 01:01:58,798
That?

763
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:08,516
So your teacher, right?

764
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:14,814
Who are you?

765
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:24,658
Shit.

766
01:02:28,036 --> 01:02:29,537
Motherfucker!

767
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:37,587
Where is?

768
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:42,050
Hang on a minute.

769
01:02:43,051 --> 01:02:44,469
I think there is a misunderstanding.

770
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:49,266
I'm a cop, you son of a bitch!

771
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:06,700
Shit!

772
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:16,668
I will remember your face!

773
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:08,386
Are you Mina Jang?

774
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:24,069
An adult asked you a question.

775
01:04:24,152 --> 01:04:28,823
Who are you? What the hell you want?

776
01:04:32,452 --> 01:04:33,536
Millennials...

777
01:04:36,081 --> 01:04:37,332
...have no manners.

778
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:05,693
Please do not kill me.

779
01:05:07,946 --> 01:05:11,157
I'm sorry, your life is a nuisance.

780
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:42,939
What the fuck?

781
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:16,764
Heavens, what the fuck? Wait, come on.

782
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:20,185
My God, what are they doing in my garden?

783
01:06:20,268 --> 01:06:24,314
Why do they wallow like wild pigs?

784
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:26,649
Lady! Call the police!

785
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:29,444
OMG, look at my lettuce!

786
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:32,113
I'll pay you for the damage! Call the police!

787
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:34,824
Where is he going?

788
01:06:34,908 --> 01:06:38,953
You have to pay me for the damages!

789
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:49,088
Damn. Goes up!

790
01:06:52,217 --> 01:06:53,927
It is dangerous. Goes up!

791
01:07:04,354 --> 01:07:07,565
- Who was? - I don't know.

792
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:11,069
Do not lie to me. I almost died to save you.

793
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:14,489
I Do not Really Know! Why were they at my house?

794
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:20,078
Despite everything, you escaped with the money?

795
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:26,042
Hey. Did you want to hit me with the pot?

796
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:27,669
I wasn't aiming at you!

797
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:30,880
Of course! You wanted to keep the bag!

798
01:07:30,964 --> 01:07:32,215
Yesterday you hit me with the stun gun.

799
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:36,219
They want you for robbery, fraud and homicide.

800
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:38,805
Shit. you are finished

801
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:41,891
- You're bleeding. - That?

802
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:43,768
- You bleed! - Do not do it!

803
01:07:44,978 --> 01:07:46,604
Do not touch me.

804
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:51,067
Damn.

805
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:14,591
What did you do with the rest of my money?

806
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:18,219
- I spent it. - Did you spend it?

807
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:20,638
Did you spend $30,000? A student?

808
01:08:20,722 --> 01:08:22,390
We have things to buy.

809
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:26,060
Damn. There is no end in sight.

810
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:28,271
Damn!

811
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:32,734
Who the fuck was it?

812
01:08:37,405 --> 01:08:42,410
Oh yeah, the phone... It was on the floor. Did you bring it?

813
01:08:42,994 --> 01:08:44,579
I have it. Because?

814
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:47,915
Thank God. I almost got hit from behind.

815
01:08:49,334 --> 01:08:51,544
Han fucked me up big time.

816
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:55,256
He killed Gi-Chul?

817
01:08:59,469 --> 01:09:02,847
Wait. If what the prosecutor said is true...

818
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:08,436
- ...this is incredible. -Did she die for me?

819
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:11,856
Don't yell at me, you fucking thief.

820
01:09:12,482 --> 01:09:14,150
- Give me the phone. - Not even in dreams.

821
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:15,610
bird.

822
01:09:16,611 --> 01:09:18,821
Come on. Demons...

823
01:09:18,905 --> 01:09:21,032
Let go! Take your hands off me.

824
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:22,784
Lady.

825
01:09:26,371 --> 01:09:31,084
- Is blocked. unlock it. - Because?

826
01:09:33,795 --> 01:09:36,047
You said he sent you a video.

827
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:43,471
Is that why he died?

828
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:47,475
Before... Forget it.

829
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:52,647
Listen, you didn't see the video.

830
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:57,694
Unlock the phone, and I'll forget about the money you stole.

831
01:09:58,277 --> 01:09:59,487
Unlock it now.

832
01:10:01,698 --> 01:10:05,493
- You do not feel like? - First, take off my handcuffs.

833
01:10:05,576 --> 01:10:07,954
Why are you always negotiating?

834
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:15,211
You're a nuisance, for a girl.

835
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:29,642
Come with me somewhere, and I'll unlock the phone.

836
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:24,739
We have to do it now. She died.

837
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:27,366
Who is the dad?

838
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:28,743
GUARDIAN CONSENT FORM

839
01:11:29,494 --> 01:11:31,162
He's a jerk.

840
01:11:31,245 --> 01:11:33,664
But you have to tell your parents, at least.

841
01:11:34,332 --> 01:11:37,084
Why are you pretending to be an adult? Sign and go.

842
01:11:38,002 --> 01:11:40,129
Damn kids.

843
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:44,884
Take. hand it over

844
01:11:51,182 --> 01:11:53,100
2-5-8-6? I thought she had tried.

845
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:07,365
Mr. Prosecutor, this video will be a tidal wave if it leaks.

846
01:12:08,825 --> 01:12:11,869
Keep your promise to clear my file.

847
01:12:11,953 --> 01:12:14,539
Detective Jo, did you cause any trouble in Ansan today?

848
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:18,251
- That? - We got a report.

849
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:21,587
We are looking for a young woman named Mina Jang.

850
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:24,340
Do you know anything about her?

851
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:27,510
Because she?

852
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:32,431
She's a key witness. If you find it,

853
01:12:32,515 --> 01:12:36,561
I'll give him a promotion on top of everything.

854
01:12:40,273 --> 01:12:41,941
I'm with her now.

855
01:12:44,569 --> 01:12:47,113
Then bring it to me. Be discreet.

856
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:56,247
control.

857
01:12:58,124 --> 01:12:59,375
Your uncle?

858
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:03,796
- More like his pimp. - That?

859
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:07,383
- It must be great. You will make a fortune. - Go to hell.

860
01:13:08,634 --> 01:13:09,635
Take.

861
01:13:11,304 --> 01:13:15,141
I'll give you 100 back. Let me try it.

862
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:23,858
I told Mina that I would do the abortion in return,

863
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:25,693
but he did not accept it.

864
01:13:26,611 --> 01:13:29,864
I'm dying to try it.

865
01:13:30,448 --> 01:13:33,117
He even brought you. What a disappointment.

866
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:40,207
Good. Heavens! I'll give you 100 more!

867
01:13:40,291 --> 01:13:42,460
But I keep it all night.

868
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:47,340
As you promised, tonight is the night.

869
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:06,776
- Hey. I'm a policeman, come out. - He's a cop. Police!

870
01:14:11,197 --> 01:14:13,741
Why did you chase them away?

871
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:17,328
What's happening?

872
01:14:21,165 --> 01:14:22,208
What are you doing?

873
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:54,717
Come.

874
01:15:56,469 --> 01:15:57,928
One tablespoon.

875
01:15:58,679 --> 01:15:59,847
No.

876
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:02,266
Come on.

877
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:06,103
Isn't that too salty?

878
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:12,526
- Thank you. - Alright. Eat.

879
01:16:15,321 --> 01:16:16,530
It's good?

880
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:21,869
Why didn't you make something healthier?

881
01:16:21,952 --> 01:16:24,413
They like. It is not good?

882
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:30,961
- Yes, give him clothes to change into. - Well.

883
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:33,547
Take off those sports clothes.

884
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:39,095
- Because? - It is not obvious?

885
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:41,639
It was from your friend Ji-Won.

886
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:50,731
How do you know Ji-Won?

887
01:16:53,484 --> 01:16:54,568
Does it surprise you?

888
01:16:55,569 --> 01:16:58,364
We knew each other a long time.

889
01:16:59,824 --> 01:17:03,077
His dad wants the clothes.

890
01:17:04,453 --> 01:17:07,832
Even if she was your best friend, you can't wear the clothes of a dead man.

891
01:17:07,915 --> 01:17:09,125
Give it away.

892
01:17:10,543 --> 01:17:11,877
- This is cute. - Change out.

893
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:13,295
Take.

894
01:17:16,757 --> 01:17:17,591
Not even in dreams.

895
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:21,137
What are you doing?

896
01:17:22,847 --> 01:17:24,890
- Heavens. - No.

897
01:17:25,933 --> 01:17:28,018
- Raise it up. - I don't want to.

898
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:33,524
I won't do it. It's mine, she gave it to me!

899
01:17:33,607 --> 01:17:35,693
You can't make me change!

900
01:17:35,776 --> 01:17:38,529
- Shit! What are you staring at? - Enough!

901
01:17:42,408 --> 01:17:43,617
Damn...

902
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:50,082
Spooky.

903
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:56,297
Whatever, but you shouldn't swear during the meal, right?

904
01:17:56,964 --> 01:17:59,800
Did you see the movie The Throne?

905
01:18:01,051 --> 01:18:02,678
"Clean your ears."

906
01:18:03,596 --> 01:18:06,182
- Pretend you didn't hear that. - Yeah.

907
01:18:06,265 --> 01:18:09,101
let's leave it. What do we do with these girls?

908
01:18:10,895 --> 01:18:12,479
Eat. Alright.

909
01:18:46,639 --> 01:18:48,224
Aside.

910
01:18:48,307 --> 01:18:50,100
- Take. - That?

911
01:18:50,184 --> 01:18:53,771
- What are you doing here? - What is this, love?

912
01:18:53,854 --> 01:18:56,690
Don't be so happy. It's not for you.

913
01:18:56,774 --> 01:18:57,608
That?

914
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:03,697
- Give him something healthy. - Clear.

915
01:19:03,781 --> 01:19:06,575
Nothing pork. Buy authentic Korean beef.

916
01:19:06,659 --> 01:19:08,702
- Don't let her out of your sight. - That?

917
01:19:08,786 --> 01:19:09,703
To her.

918
01:19:11,538 --> 01:19:14,416
He is asking for help.

919
01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:37,106
That? What's happening? Why are you looking at me?

920
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:39,358
Do you have something to say?

921
01:19:40,234 --> 01:19:42,987
Did you always have that scar?

922
01:19:44,947 --> 01:19:45,948
And if so?

923
01:19:47,866 --> 01:19:49,702
Haven't we met before?

924
01:19:52,037 --> 01:19:53,205
Us?

925
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:56,542
Are you flirting with me?

926
01:19:57,751 --> 01:20:00,170
It's got to be a joke, baby.

927
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:06,093
Listen.

928
01:20:07,261 --> 01:20:11,348
Give the set back to his dad.

929
01:20:12,099 --> 01:20:16,937
Imagine what he must be suffering. He wanted to burn it in honor of her.

930
01:20:18,772 --> 01:20:20,607
I know how you feel.

931
01:20:20,691 --> 01:20:24,945
You lost your friend, you're a teenager. We all go through the same thing.

932
01:20:25,029 --> 01:20:25,988
And your doll...

933
01:20:28,699 --> 01:20:32,619
I went through all that: drinking, motorcycles, that shit.

934
01:20:32,703 --> 01:20:35,748
- What do you know? - That?

935
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:38,042
What the fuck do you know?

936
01:20:39,293 --> 01:20:41,670
We were going so well!

937
01:20:41,754 --> 01:20:44,673
You're an asshole for pretending you know everything!

938
01:20:44,757 --> 01:20:46,842
You are the idiot! Heavens!

939
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:51,221
You have a problem with your attitude.

940
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:54,975
I wonder what you will be when you grow up.

941
01:20:59,355 --> 01:21:02,274
- Attack the titans. - That?

942
01:21:04,193 --> 01:21:06,362
I will be the titan of that series.

943
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:12,242
I will destroy the president's house and kill everyone.

944
01:21:15,329 --> 01:21:16,246
Do you take drugs?

945
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:30,094
Asshole, make it shine.

946
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:35,391
What do they do? Idiots, do you want to steal the bike?

947
01:21:35,474 --> 01:21:37,851
What do they do? Stop doing that.

948
01:21:37,935 --> 01:21:40,729
You need to cut the boot, you newbie morons.

949
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:42,231
What the hell is going on here?

950
01:21:43,857 --> 01:21:47,319
- Damn... - What the hell did you say?

951
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:51,740
- That? - Come on.

952
01:21:51,824 --> 01:21:53,075
Damn.

953
01:21:58,288 --> 01:22:00,040
You really are a policeman.

954
01:22:03,377 --> 01:22:07,381
I'm a fucking loyal public servant.

955
01:22:09,466 --> 01:22:10,509
Can you give me that?

956
01:22:11,677 --> 01:22:14,930
Well. Take. Heavens.

957
01:22:27,693 --> 01:22:30,362
What's happening? Do not you want to go?

958
01:22:34,074 --> 01:22:35,951
There is nothing wrong.

959
01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:40,164
You just go and tell them what you know from the video.

960
01:22:40,247 --> 01:22:41,248
Yeah?

961
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:44,501
Let's go to Ji-Won's chicken shop.

962
01:22:45,919 --> 01:22:47,004
That?

963
01:22:48,547 --> 01:22:53,302
I'll give you the jacket back, so let's go.

964
01:22:56,805 --> 01:22:58,098
Don't you want to go alone?

965
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:02,644
And you buy me chicken.

966
01:23:04,521 --> 01:23:07,441
The last time I ate it was with Ji-Won.

967
01:23:15,866 --> 01:23:17,326
It's good?

968
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:22,498
Very good.

969
01:23:25,709 --> 01:23:27,252
Fine, deal done.

970
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:40,307
Why must we meet here?

971
01:23:43,268 --> 01:23:45,812
Hello? I'm here.

972
01:24:04,414 --> 01:24:05,749
What the fuck?

973
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:07,459
Prosecutor?

974
01:24:17,219 --> 01:24:18,053
Welcome.

975
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:22,766
Oh, no.

976
01:24:30,107 --> 01:24:31,400
Take your hands off me.

977
01:24:42,452 --> 01:24:46,123
Hello. So you are Mina Jang. Come on.

978
01:24:46,999 --> 01:24:50,460
Here we go. We are not bad.

979
01:24:52,671 --> 01:24:55,048
Hey, Pil-Ho Jo.

980
01:24:56,258 --> 01:25:00,053
- You see? She knew that she had a premonition. - Motherfucker!

981
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:06,059
You really are a fucking Korean prosecutor.

982
01:25:06,143 --> 01:25:08,979
Definitely a bona fide one.

983
01:25:09,062 --> 01:25:10,897
I have a Taesung scholarship.

984
01:25:10,981 --> 01:25:12,983
Why did you tell him that?

985
01:25:13,567 --> 01:25:18,780
I had a hard time setting up the number for Taesung.

986
01:25:20,115 --> 01:25:22,200
You look well.

987
01:25:23,493 --> 01:25:24,494
Shit.

988
01:25:28,373 --> 01:25:33,545
Detective Jo, it's a duplicate phone. Where is the one from that night?

989
01:25:35,881 --> 01:25:38,091
How the fuck am I supposed to know?

990
01:25:43,096 --> 01:25:44,306
Let's see...

991
01:25:55,067 --> 01:25:58,904
Let me ask you again. Han sent this to two people.

992
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:02,407
- Where is the original video? - I don't know, idiot.

993
01:26:09,956 --> 01:26:12,751
- Put your hand here. - Let go!

994
01:26:26,223 --> 01:26:28,475
You must answer when I ask you well.

995
01:26:29,226 --> 01:26:33,105
Detective Jo, for the last time...

996
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:36,149
This is the girl's, and this is yours.

997
01:26:37,693 --> 01:26:38,610
Where is the telephone?

998
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:52,457
Fuck off, you idiot.

999
01:26:54,626 --> 01:26:56,336
You're the best.

1000
01:26:58,547 --> 01:26:59,548
Above.

1001
01:27:03,677 --> 01:27:06,555
I'll close the deposit case like an accident,

1002
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:09,182
so fix everything with the means.

1003
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:11,184
Hey, Pil-Ho Jo...

1004
01:27:12,644 --> 01:27:14,187
Good job.

1005
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:17,524
Study hard or you will be like him.

1006
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:29,995
You have to live, study, travel and have boyfriends.

1007
01:27:32,956 --> 01:27:37,711
Tell me where you hid the video or you will die like Jin-Gyu Song.

1008
01:27:41,673 --> 01:27:46,511
You did not know? Her silence killed him.

1009
01:27:47,929 --> 01:27:51,725
Do not look at me like that. I didn't kill him.

1010
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:57,397
- Mister? - Yeah?

1011
01:28:00,233 --> 01:28:01,818
Fuck off.

1012
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:12,871
Stop, you son of a bitch.

1013
01:28:13,955 --> 01:28:16,124
Why are you threatening a girl?

1014
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:18,960
- Let her go, and we can talk. - This scares me.

1015
01:28:19,836 --> 01:28:21,588
Hold on tight.

1016
01:28:21,671 --> 01:28:25,383
- If I fall, I'll take you with me. - Yes Boss.

1017
01:28:26,051 --> 01:28:30,597
Jo, if you keep lying, my arm gets tired.

1018
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:34,392
I have it! Stop, wretch!

1019
01:28:34,476 --> 01:28:37,479
I have it. I have the original video.

1020
01:28:37,562 --> 01:28:39,564
- Where? - In a safe place.

1021
01:28:39,648 --> 01:28:43,485
I'll send it to you by FedEx. Let her go.

1022
01:28:44,653 --> 01:28:46,154
Damn! In the office closet.

1023
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:51,576
I hid it at the police station. You will never find it.

1024
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:56,414
I'll bring it to you. Let the girl go, and we'll talk.

1025
01:28:57,457 --> 01:28:59,543
Motherfucker! There is no other copy!

1026
01:29:07,342 --> 01:29:11,304
- Fuck me? - Enough.

1027
01:29:11,388 --> 01:29:14,099
- Oh really? - Stop it, idiot!

1028
01:29:21,565 --> 01:29:23,358
Damn!

1029
01:29:29,239 --> 01:29:33,410
Go home. You can go home.

1030
01:29:34,911 --> 01:29:36,079
Alright.

1031
01:29:38,415 --> 01:29:41,960
Good. Your telephone. Where is my wallet?

1032
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:45,130
How much is it?

1033
01:29:46,131 --> 01:29:48,758
Here's a little more.

1034
01:29:49,634 --> 01:29:52,596
Buy yourself a nice phone with this.

1035
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:58,685
We'll take you to the police station to deliver the video.

1036
01:29:59,769 --> 01:30:03,189
- Keep your promise. - Got it, asshole.

1037
01:30:04,274 --> 01:30:05,650
Prepare the car.

1038
01:30:13,450 --> 01:30:16,328
That? Do you have something to say?

1039
01:30:18,455 --> 01:30:21,166
OK tell me.

1040
01:30:23,877 --> 01:30:25,170
Idiots.

1041
01:30:35,597 --> 01:30:37,557
What an example of adults they are...

1042
01:30:41,019 --> 01:30:43,229
They are idiots and they are called adults.

1043
01:30:52,739 --> 01:30:54,407
Tell So-Hee I'm sorry.

1044
01:31:27,065 --> 01:31:31,236
Shit. She is crazy?

1045
01:31:37,867 --> 01:31:38,702
Throw it at him too.

1046
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:45,041
throw it away

1047
01:31:47,043 --> 01:31:52,716
Let go! Hey! I have the video, you hear me?

1048
01:31:52,799 --> 01:31:55,218
You won't be safe if you kill me!

1049
01:31:55,301 --> 01:31:59,889
Internal Affairs saw me racketeering with the prosecutor.

1050
01:31:59,973 --> 01:32:04,310
- They know everything about the video! - Hey! Aside!

1051
01:32:05,311 --> 01:32:09,232
Hey! If Internal Affairs finds it, you're finished.

1052
01:32:09,315 --> 01:32:11,943
Why do you complicate everything?

1053
01:32:12,026 --> 01:32:14,988
Pay me and I'll give it to you.

1054
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:18,867
They are all rich, right?

1055
01:32:23,204 --> 01:32:25,832
- Put him in the car. - Yes sir.

1056
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:30,628
Damn.

1057
01:33:09,167 --> 01:33:12,170
You should eat fewer late-night snacks.

1058
01:33:13,755 --> 01:33:17,717
I went up a couple sizes, right? I have too many dinner dates.

1059
01:33:27,185 --> 01:33:29,229
Listen! Pil-Ho Jo!

1060
01:33:30,939 --> 01:33:33,691
An ex-marine, right? I was too.

1061
01:33:35,276 --> 01:33:36,653
Aren't you going to come?

1062
01:33:41,699 --> 01:33:44,077
- I salute you. - How gullible.

1063
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:46,329
My family is exempt.

1064
01:33:47,747 --> 01:33:52,919
I thought it was tough. I like you, Detective Jo.

1065
01:33:55,672 --> 01:34:00,426
You know the saying: "The law is only for 10,000"?

1066
01:34:05,098 --> 01:34:10,061
All men fight to be included in that figure.

1067
01:34:13,439 --> 01:34:15,191
I know you like money.

1068
01:34:21,030 --> 01:34:23,992
Here is $78,000. Why?

1069
01:34:25,326 --> 01:34:30,331
Your video costs $780 million, divide that by 10,000.

1070
01:34:35,003 --> 01:34:36,296
The video.

1071
01:34:40,425 --> 01:34:41,926
How much does it cost?

1072
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:45,179
I know the girl was engaged.

1073
01:34:45,263 --> 01:34:48,600
It is a scum of society, a vagina for customers.

1074
01:34:48,683 --> 01:34:51,060
Your life is worth 78 cents.

1075
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:55,398
These cockroaches are running our society.

1076
01:34:56,107 --> 01:34:58,526
Compared to her, this is generosity.

1077
01:34:59,819 --> 01:35:04,699
Detective Jo, see you soon. It could be our obedient mole.

1078
01:35:12,874 --> 01:35:14,000
Detective.

1079
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:19,881
You are here thanks to her. Do not forget.

1080
01:36:00,254 --> 01:36:01,422
Hello?

1081
01:36:05,885 --> 01:36:06,970
Who?

1082
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:09,389
There is a civilian diver named Hong-Jin

1083
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:11,432
who pulled Ji-Won out of the Sewol.

1084
01:36:12,016 --> 01:36:16,104
He had torn muscles and a broken spine.

1085
01:36:16,771 --> 01:36:18,314
The country stopped paying the bills.

1086
01:36:19,315 --> 01:36:20,400
But a few days ago...

1087
01:36:20,942 --> 01:36:22,026
HONG-JIN MO BREAKDOWN

1088
01:36:22,110 --> 01:36:26,072
...someone sent you $30,000 on my behalf.

1089
01:36:28,074 --> 01:36:29,492
To help pay for the hospital.

1090
01:36:32,704 --> 01:36:34,539
I didn't send anything.

1091
01:36:37,250 --> 01:36:38,876
Mine sure sent it.

1092
01:36:41,087 --> 01:36:44,757
He even saved my life once.

1093
01:37:00,189 --> 01:37:02,358
- Pil-Ho Jo! - Yes?

1094
01:37:02,442 --> 01:37:05,445
Don't make a scandal. Get treated.

1095
01:37:06,237 --> 01:37:07,238
Clear.

1096
01:37:15,747 --> 01:37:18,958
What a beautiful day, darling.

1097
01:37:29,052 --> 01:37:31,220
- Thank you. - That?

1098
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:38,019
Use this.

1099
01:37:42,065 --> 01:37:44,776
I called for Ji-Won's dad to be here.

1100
01:37:46,152 --> 01:37:47,153
Thank you.

1101
01:37:49,113 --> 01:37:50,782
What the fuck?

1102
01:38:01,375 --> 01:38:04,087
What's happening? Do not you want to go?

1103
01:38:05,379 --> 01:38:07,256
There is nothing wrong.

1104
01:38:07,340 --> 01:38:11,094
You just go and tell them what you know from the video.

1105
01:38:11,177 --> 01:38:15,223
Buy me chicken.

1106
01:38:17,517 --> 01:38:20,561
The last time I ate it was with Ji-Won.

1107
01:38:24,190 --> 01:38:25,650
Fine, I deal.

1108
01:39:28,629 --> 01:39:31,424
Hi Ji Won. How have you been?

1109
01:39:32,008 --> 01:39:33,009
It's me, Mina.

1110
01:39:37,054 --> 01:39:41,559
Did you have your birthday party today?

1111
01:39:53,863 --> 01:39:57,700
I called you as soon as I woke up.

1112
01:39:58,409 --> 01:40:00,119
I'm crazy, right?

1113
01:40:16,469 --> 01:40:21,140
I even went to Bupyeong to buy you a dress.

1114
01:40:21,974 --> 01:40:24,185
It's not a joke, it's great.

1115
01:40:25,978 --> 01:40:30,107
But I don't know how to send it to you.

1116
01:40:33,027 --> 01:40:35,071
Your dad is fine.

1117
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:38,241
Have a nice day with the others.

1118
01:40:41,369 --> 01:40:43,537
Give my regards to Hee-Jin and Mi-Ji.

1119
01:40:44,163 --> 01:40:45,831
Sung-woo and Jin-sung too.

1120
01:40:46,624 --> 01:40:50,336
And the teacher at home.

1121
01:40:53,547 --> 01:40:58,678
I missed you, that's why I went for a walk with your shoes and backpack.

1122
01:40:59,971 --> 01:41:02,890
I thought I smelled your scent, like you were following me.

1123
01:41:06,602 --> 01:41:08,771
I looked back, but you weren't there.

1124
01:41:11,816 --> 01:41:13,150
I cried like a wretch.

1125
01:41:20,908 --> 01:41:21,993
Ji-Won...

1126
01:41:24,412 --> 01:41:25,705
I really miss you.

1127
01:41:30,418 --> 01:41:33,212
If you don't recognize me, you're fried.

1128
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:39,260
Mina loves Ji-Won, who loves Mina.

1129
01:41:42,596 --> 01:41:44,307
Shit.

1130
01:41:55,026 --> 01:41:56,110
PIL-HO JO I LIKE

1131
01:42:23,846 --> 01:42:28,351
I thought you didn't like pork bone soup. You are not like that.

1132
01:42:54,877 --> 01:42:56,253
Hee-Sook.

1133
01:42:58,172 --> 01:42:59,298
¡Hee-Sook Yang!

1134
01:43:00,341 --> 01:43:01,342
Yeah?

1135
01:43:03,803 --> 01:43:04,845
I love you.

1136
01:43:07,348 --> 01:43:08,307
Humbug.

1137
01:43:11,685 --> 01:43:13,312
Are you going far?

1138
01:43:15,523 --> 01:43:16,607
That...?

1139
01:43:23,239 --> 01:43:25,616
TAESUNG GROUP SCHOLARSHIP EVENT

1140
01:43:42,341 --> 01:43:43,384
Please come in.

1141
01:43:45,052 --> 01:43:48,139
Please come in. One by one.

1142
01:43:48,222 --> 01:43:49,682
He has orthodontics.

1143
01:43:55,312 --> 01:43:56,689
Can I go now?

1144
01:44:01,944 --> 01:44:07,074
Damn. Why is so complicated? Let's solve this at once.

1145
01:44:09,285 --> 01:44:13,122
Dude, stop touching my hairy ass!

1146
01:44:20,129 --> 01:44:22,173
I have a metal nail in my ass.

1147
01:44:22,256 --> 01:44:25,134
I got hurt catching gangsters. You do not believe me?

1148
01:44:29,847 --> 01:44:31,474
Upload it without making a mess.

1149
01:44:34,602 --> 01:44:38,147
I'm sorry. I didn't know about today's event.

1150
01:44:38,230 --> 01:44:40,024
Give me the phone and go.

1151
01:44:41,734 --> 01:44:43,777
I have to talk to the director.

1152
01:44:44,487 --> 01:44:45,696
On the illegal background.

1153
01:44:46,947 --> 01:44:49,533
I have key information from the headquarters.

1154
01:44:52,620 --> 01:44:54,747
I'll give it to him in person and talk to him.

1155
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:58,292
We are on the same team.

1156
01:45:03,380 --> 01:45:07,635
Was this place always so majestic?

1157
01:45:08,886 --> 01:45:10,888
It will take two hours. Wait here.

1158
01:45:10,971 --> 01:45:12,681
Clear. Have fun.

1159
01:45:18,312 --> 01:45:21,315
What the fuck is that? It is expensive?

1160
01:45:21,398 --> 01:45:23,067
May I try it on?

1161
01:45:23,901 --> 01:45:27,196
They gave me such a beating that my whole body hurts.

1162
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:30,241
Damn, how it hurts.

1163
01:45:31,492 --> 01:45:33,327
How is it turned on?

1164
01:45:36,121 --> 01:45:38,707
Why are you looking at me like that? It's not serious. I just want to try it.

1165
01:45:42,044 --> 01:45:43,921
"Astronaut experience"? What is this?

1166
01:45:44,672 --> 01:45:45,798
Do I become an astronaut?

1167
01:46:03,357 --> 01:46:04,650
Shit.

1168
01:46:06,277 --> 01:46:08,862
Where is the restroom?

1169
01:46:08,946 --> 01:46:10,864
They made me want to shit.

1170
01:46:11,865 --> 01:46:15,369
This massages your gut.

1171
01:46:19,331 --> 01:46:20,499
Nice to see you.

1172
01:46:20,583 --> 01:46:21,584
Welcome.

1173
01:46:25,087 --> 01:46:26,171
A pleasure.

1174
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:51,238
What the fuck do you want?

1175
01:46:51,322 --> 01:46:54,825
Asshole, why didn't you call me earlier?

1176
01:46:54,908 --> 01:46:55,743
Did you run out of love?

1177
01:46:55,826 --> 01:46:57,244
Don't you want to catch me?

1178
01:46:57,328 --> 01:47:01,415
Hearing your voice makes me want to throw up.

1179
01:47:01,498 --> 01:47:04,001
Listen to what I tell you. It is important.

1180
01:47:05,085 --> 01:47:07,755
You know about the video Han sent me.

1181
01:47:08,589 --> 01:47:12,009
If it leaks, Korea goes to hell.

1182
01:47:12,092 --> 01:47:14,845
I'm about to make a deal with Taesung.

1183
01:47:16,055 --> 01:47:16,889
You understand?

1184
01:47:17,973 --> 01:47:18,974
Where are you?

1185
01:47:20,476 --> 01:47:23,854
At Taesung Headquarters, 15th floor. Hurry up, baby.

1186
01:47:24,772 --> 01:47:27,316
If you're late, I'm off to the Philippines with my money.

1187
01:47:28,275 --> 01:47:29,526
Huh?

1188
01:47:29,610 --> 01:47:32,071
Turn around! Right now!

1189
01:48:06,772 --> 01:48:10,526
We will start with a promotional video.

1190
01:48:34,341 --> 01:48:39,179
Please welcome director Yi-Hyang Jung to the stage.

1191
01:48:48,689 --> 01:48:49,815
Good afternoon.

1192
01:48:49,898 --> 01:48:52,526
I am the CEO of the Esperanza Foundation, Yi-Hyang Jung.

1193
01:49:28,103 --> 01:49:29,563
There is a camera on the wall.

1194
01:49:36,487 --> 01:49:40,240
Sorry, our job is to see everything.

1195
01:49:40,866 --> 01:49:42,075
To come see them,

1196
01:49:42,159 --> 01:49:46,163
I combed my hair, put on perfume,

1197
01:49:46,246 --> 01:49:49,583
and I drove a 5000cc car. Aren't they jealous?

1198
01:49:51,543 --> 01:49:55,422
You never had the video, right?

1199
01:49:57,549 --> 01:49:58,967
Fool.

1200
01:50:02,888 --> 01:50:05,307
Drown him and dump him after the event.

1201
01:50:06,475 --> 01:50:09,102
- People are watching. Careful. - Yes sir.

1202
01:50:10,479 --> 01:50:11,313
Leave me.

1203
01:50:13,315 --> 01:50:16,276
¡Suéltenme!

1204
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:18,612
¡Suéltenme!

1205
01:50:57,442 --> 01:50:58,360
Shoot?

1206
01:51:00,237 --> 01:51:01,238
You want to try?

1207
01:51:24,428 --> 01:51:26,805
...lost everything he had. What did I do?

1208
01:51:27,389 --> 01:51:32,144
I took care of my siblings and studied hard...

1209
01:52:13,435 --> 01:52:18,148
I am here thanks to the generosity of my teachers.

1210
01:52:44,675 --> 01:52:45,842
AROMATIC MASSAGE OIL

1211
01:53:04,361 --> 01:53:06,405
Take this, asshole!

1212
01:53:06,488 --> 01:53:07,990
Motherfucker!

1213
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:13,245
Damn bastard! Motherfucker!

1214
01:53:14,871 --> 01:53:17,749
Unfortunate! Come!

1215
01:53:17,833 --> 01:53:19,418
Come to me.

1216
01:53:29,011 --> 01:53:30,095
Shit!

1217
01:53:32,305 --> 01:53:33,223
Come.

1218
01:53:36,059 --> 01:53:39,771
And? Come to me, idiot!

1219
01:53:40,313 --> 01:53:41,565
Come to me!

1220
01:53:42,232 --> 01:53:47,571
Show me the best you got, motherfucker!

1221
01:53:57,873 --> 01:53:59,875
You can't catch me, can you?

1222
01:54:01,418 --> 01:54:02,878
Come on!

1223
01:54:13,722 --> 01:54:15,348
Motherfucker!

1224
01:54:32,741 --> 01:54:36,578
Let go! Son of...

1225
01:55:12,030 --> 01:55:14,282
What is the purpose of my anecdote?

1226
01:55:15,867 --> 01:55:17,119
What can I do for you?

1227
01:55:17,202 --> 01:55:19,121
I'm looking for someone.

1228
01:55:38,306 --> 01:55:39,516
Shoot.

1229
01:55:55,115 --> 01:55:56,616
...will start here.

1230
01:55:56,700 --> 01:56:00,245
You are the future and the hope of Korea.

1231
01:56:00,829 --> 01:56:04,124
Smile when you wake up and push forward.

1232
01:56:04,708 --> 01:56:06,460
Taesung will always be on her side.

1233
01:56:07,210 --> 01:56:10,005
Taesung will support you

1234
01:56:11,089 --> 01:56:14,176
with everything we have.

1235
01:56:14,759 --> 01:56:15,886
Therefore...

1236
01:56:18,346 --> 01:56:20,974
- Huh? -He went crazy?

1237
01:56:23,685 --> 01:56:25,937
Is it a parody?

1238
01:56:27,105 --> 01:56:28,565
Wrong room?

1239
01:56:32,652 --> 01:56:33,570
Get him off the stage.

1240
01:56:38,492 --> 01:56:40,911
- Mister. - It can't be there.

1241
01:56:41,495 --> 01:56:42,954
Exit the stage.

1242
01:56:50,670 --> 01:56:54,007
Pil-Ho Jo! What the fuck?

1243
01:56:56,134 --> 01:56:57,135
Pil-Ho Jo, stop!

1244
01:57:01,306 --> 01:57:04,559
Pil-Ho Jo, put the gun down.

1245
01:57:04,643 --> 01:57:05,560
Listen carefully.

1246
01:57:06,728 --> 01:57:11,900
No life is worth 78 cents in this world.

1247
01:57:13,235 --> 01:57:14,236
did you understand?

1248
01:57:45,725 --> 01:57:50,647
I won't hurt you. Alright.

1249
01:58:00,407 --> 01:58:01,283
I'm sorry.

1250
01:58:02,701 --> 01:58:05,370
I shouldn't have scared them.

1251
01:58:06,413 --> 01:58:11,001
I promised to buy you chicken.

1252
01:58:13,837 --> 01:58:15,755
But these sons of bitches...

1253
01:58:20,302 --> 01:58:21,428
Pil-Ho!

1254
01:59:15,273 --> 01:59:17,984
With the assassination of director Jung,

1255
01:59:18,068 --> 01:59:20,987
Taesung's case has taken an unexpected turn.

1256
01:59:21,655 --> 01:59:26,034
According to a witness statement, Director Jung ordered

1257
01:59:26,117 --> 01:59:30,622
the theft and destruction of evidence against him,

1258
01:59:30,705 --> 01:59:37,045
and Chief Prosecutor Sung-Sik Nam was involved in the organization.

1259
01:59:41,466 --> 01:59:45,553
Meanwhile, detective Pil-Ho Jo, who killed Director Jung,

1260
01:59:45,637 --> 01:59:49,015
acted out of simple revenge

1261
01:59:49,099 --> 01:59:53,561
and is expected to receive a severe punishment

1262
01:59:53,645 --> 01:59:56,398
for abusing his authority as a law enforcement officer.

1263
01:59:56,481 --> 01:59:59,025
I knew it would ruin her big. Look at her eyes.

1264
01:59:59,109 --> 02:00:00,735
I shouldn't have gotten involved with him.

1265
02:00:01,444 --> 02:00:04,572
Korean cops are all crooked. Damn cretin.

1266
02:00:09,577 --> 02:00:10,912
What's happening?

1267
02:00:12,580 --> 02:00:14,416
- Go away. - That?

1268
02:00:15,125 --> 02:00:17,210
I won't charge you, so walk away.

1269
02:00:17,293 --> 02:00:21,506
You are crazy? We not finished.

1270
02:00:24,551 --> 02:00:28,054
They talk too much without knowing the facts.

1271
02:00:28,138 --> 02:00:30,807
I'll cut out their tongues and make them mincemeat.

1272
02:00:32,225 --> 02:00:36,312
What are you staring at? You look like the head of an anchovy.

1273
02:00:37,063 --> 02:00:40,191
And you, a boiled pig.

1274
02:00:40,275 --> 02:00:44,738
You would look good in pork bone soup.

1275
02:00:44,821 --> 02:00:46,322
Shit.

1276
02:00:46,406 --> 02:00:48,950
Get the hell out of here.

1277
02:00:52,662 --> 02:00:55,248
Where are you? Class is over?

1278
02:00:55,832 --> 02:00:58,460
Come when you hear this.

1279
02:00:58,543 --> 02:01:00,754
I made your favorite dish, crab in soy sauce.

1280
02:01:01,463 --> 02:01:02,589
Bye bye.

1281
02:01:08,303 --> 02:01:09,971
Class is over?

1282
02:01:10,054 --> 02:01:12,599
Come when you hear this.

1283
02:01:12,682 --> 02:01:15,435
I made your favorite dish, crab in soy sauce.

1284
02:01:15,518 --> 02:01:16,352
Bye bye.

1285
02:01:40,585 --> 02:01:42,504
ANSAN CULTURE SQUARE

1286
02:02:08,780 --> 02:02:11,741
Hey, wait a minute.

1287
02:02:13,117 --> 02:02:14,661
Sit down!

1288
02:02:15,703 --> 02:02:18,164
Are you OK?

1289
02:02:18,248 --> 02:02:20,458
Let me! I have to talk to her!

1290
02:02:21,042 --> 02:02:26,714
Miss! Be fine! Have a nice life!

1291
02:07:14,752 --> 02:07:16,754
