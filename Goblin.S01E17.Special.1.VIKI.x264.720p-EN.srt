00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:36,810
it would cause an NG. So you have to pour it all at once for the action scenes.

163
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:41,470
It was a drama that had a lot of difficult scenes.

164
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:46,310
[Kim Shin pours everything into this scene at once]

165
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:49,570
Cut! It's an okay!

166
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:58,100
[This is how Kim Shin's perfect battle scene was made]

167
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,000
I am good with using my bare hands.

168
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,600
[You are cool whatever you do]

169
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,870
Now that I have tried sword action, I think doing it with bare hands is easier.

170
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,940
I'm not sure if it's because I am used to it.

171
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,940
[Should I show you?]

172
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:12,910
[This is bare hands action!]

173
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:15,310
[This is bare hands action!]

174
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,860
The camera might break so...

175
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,420
We'll take a look at that once more.

176
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,420
Nice to meet you.

177
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,630
[Everyone suffered individually, compared to the Goblin]

178
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,770
I'm Sunny.

179

[With a harmonious atmosphere, the start of the first filming of Sunny

181
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,870
Nice to meet you.

182
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,600
[Should I do it like this?]

183
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,750
Ohh!

184
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,670
Yeah!

185
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,690
Who will pay for it?

186
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:41,610
[Her. Sunny.]

187
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:45,680
Like the guys who do hip hop... like this...

[This time with a gun bang!]

189
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,410
[This time with a gun bang!]

190
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,880
Why? You should do this at the end.

191
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,710
[Sunny who burst out laughing with Reaper's sense of humor]

192
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,410
It's fun.

[Peachy Couple who are so sweet from their first taping]

194

Then you should act like you're dying.

195
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,500
- It was the 7th episode when I first met you.
- Yes.

196
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,800
So, that overpass became a place of affection for me.

197
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,510
That's right. Should we visit that place sometime?

198
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,740
Let's leave memories as memories.

199
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,520
Now, this time...

200
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,400
The person with the ID, Give Me Your Boyfriend, sent us a story.

201
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,760
ShinTak couple and Peachy couple were both so loving.

202
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,270
Would I be able to fall in love like these couples?

203
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:30,540
Goblin, if you're going to leave me, give me a boyfriend!

204
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,740
She used Eun Tak's line, "Give me my boyfriend" in her story.

205
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,230
That's right. But we can't come up with a boyfriend for you.

206
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,930
That's impossible.

207
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:46,500
So, we will recall our beautiful love story of Goblin couple instead.

208
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:52,100
Yes, someone who created the Goblin couple and was always concerned for them and has watched over them...

209
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,720
Someone very special. She'll personally tell us the story.

210

Then, are Gong Yoo and Kim Go Eun's parents coming out?

211

Who could it be? Why don't we meet the person right away?

212
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:07,600
[Love Story Recall]

213
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,600
[A special person visiting the studio]

[Samshin Grandma, Lee El]

215
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:20,860
There's a special child that I have created.

216
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,810
When I created you, I was happy.

217
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:33,430
All children are special, but Eun Tak made me feel especially happy.

218
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:36,010
The year Eun Tak turned 19 years old...

219
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:40,320
In front of that child who was desperately making a wish, one man appeared.

220
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,440
Was it you?

221
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:49,300
This child also is the child I created 939 years ago, Kim Shin.

222
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:54,930
Only the Goblin Bride will be able to pull that sword out of you.

223
00:12:54,930 --> 00:13:00,500
When the sword is taken out, you will return to nothing and will find peace.

224
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,150
He was killed by the sword of the king he used to serve.

225
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:08,850
But the God gave him an immortal life whether that may be a reward or punishment.

226
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:14,560
I'm still alive like this and have not been at peace.

227
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,670
- Ahjussi, are you a Goblin by any chance?
- Who are you?

228
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:24,770
It's a bit awkward to say this with my own lips, but I'm the Goblin Bride.

229
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,880
I love you.

230
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,570
After several hundred years, he finally met the Goblin Bride.

231
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:36,260
As if destined, Eun Tak also fell instantly for Kim Shin.

232
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,930
Can you... really see it?

233
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,920
This sword.

234
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:48,740
Now I can end this tiresome immortal life. I'm a bit relieved, but it wasn't always so tiresome.

235
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,560
I do kind of want to live.

236
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,680
Kim Shin was happy to meet the bride he's been waiting for so long.

237
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,490
He also felt bittersweet about the thought of having to end his life.

238
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:02,860
Do you want to live long? Even though you're the only one who's stuck and everyone else has gone away?

239
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:09,730
You'll be here, Ahjussi. Since you'll continue to be around, I think I'll be okay about living a long time.

240
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,170
Ahjussi!

241
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:19,620
My heart kept doing the dizzying pendulum motion from heaven to earth.

242
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,140
It was my first love.

243
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:29,860
And he began to feel the emotions of first love toward Eun Tak.

244
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:33,020
♬ You, on the way back  ♬

245
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,740
Ahjussi, do you love me?

246
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,470
If you need that, let's do that, too.

247
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:48,210
I love you.

248
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:51,940
[Before his feelings got much deeper, Kim Shin...]

249
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:54,580
[Before his attachment to his life gets bigger...]

250
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,910
[He wanted to have his sword taken out and end his immortal life.]

♬  I’ll certainly recognize you ♬

252
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,270
I should disappear.

253
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:08,640
Ending this life...

254
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,990
♬ Even at a place without you... ♬

255
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:19,600
[The day they decided to pull the sword out, Eun Tak couldn't hold onto the sword.]

256
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,230
Wait, why can't I hold onto it? I think this is it. I know it.

257
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,770
- What?
- A kiss.

258
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:32,540
In order to hold onto the sword, even deeper love was necessary...

259
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,520
In any case...

260
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,540
It's nice to be back.

261
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,450
Kim Shin was happy inside...

262
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:46,180
He wanted to stay with Eun Tak even for one more day...

263
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:53,370
But Kim Shin soon started feeling great pain in his chest where the sword was stuck.

264
00:15:55,010 --> 00:16:00,250
What's wrong? Does it hurt? Is it because of the sword?

265
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:05,980
Ahjussi...
[At last, Eun Tak got to hold the sword]

266
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,350
I can hold the sword.

267
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,880
Wait just a moment. I'll pull it out.

268
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:23,860
Unbeknown to himself, Kim Shin pushed away Eun Tak, who was trying to pull out the sword, with great strength.

269
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:43,330
Eun Tak became curious after experiencing this.

270
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:48,020
What will happen if she pulls out Kim Shin's sword...

271
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:53,510
What happens if I pull out the sword?

272
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:56,710
Someone to end the Goblin's immortal life. The tool of extinction.

273
00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:00,860
So, if I pull that sword out...

274
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,310
Ahjussi will die?

275
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:09,670
And in front of Eun Tak, a shadow of death kept drawing toward her.

276
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:15,480
It was heartbreaking, but I had to get in the middle of their love for the sake of my children...

277
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:22,340
Hurry up and pull that sword out. Pull it out and exist no longer.

278
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:29,080
If you don't pull the sword out, death will find that child continuously. I'm sure it's already happened several times.

279
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,710
What the heck? Stay still!

280
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:38,400
It will get worse. More often than accidents that have happened before, with more intensity.

281
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,380
Kim Shin, who is a strong child, was confused for a moment, but...

282
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:53,410
he was changing up the variables in God's plan and enduring miraculously one day at a time.

283
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:58,070
Human desperation can open any doors and...

284
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:03,370
at times, could one of the doors that open up be a variable in God's plan?

285
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,900
I don't know how many times I've gone to hell within an hour.

286
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:17,730
Wouldn't it be nice if their happiness lasted forever this way...

287
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:22,020
Slowly, the end to their love was nearing.

288
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:28,950
Good to meet you. You must be the Goblin Bride.

289
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:34,110
The purpose of this sword is...

290
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:39,810
That was it. To take down Park Joong Hun.

291
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:46,310
In order to cut the chord with Park Joong Hun who was threatening Eun Tak's life, Kim Shin...

292
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:51,800
had to borrow Eun Tak's hands to pull out the sword from his body.

293
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:10,380
It was unfortunate, but I could only stand by and watch their parting...

294
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:17,120
Having met you in my life... you're my prize.

295
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:25,340
Kim Shin suddenly disappeared like this right in front of Eun Tak's eyes...

296
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:43,150
Remember... I must remember... His name was Kim Shin...

297
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:47,550
Eun Tak tried everything to remember that moment...

298
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:51,730
But in the end, she lost all the memories of him.

299
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:59,560
Between life and death, between light and darkness...

300
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:06,130
In a place where even God is no longer, he was trapped in a state of immortality.

301
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:10,610
Kim Shin who returned to nothing, he chose to get caught up in between life and death in order to get back to Eun Tak.

302
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:14,460
Kim Shin who returned to nothing, he chose to get caught up in between life and death in order to get back to Eun Tak.

303
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:20,080
Eun Tak who lost her memory was in deep pain due to sadness not knowing why...

304
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,630
Whose face am I to forget? And forget what promise?

305
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:31,800
Someone please save me.

306
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,680
One day after nine years had passed...

307
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,530
Eun Tak's desperate heart was heard by Kim Shin.

308
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:43,550
Their desperate longing for each other finally found each other.

309
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:49,700
Although Eun Tak didn't recognize Kim Shin at first,

310
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:53,970
her feelings beyond the memories started to waver.

311
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:59,100
Is your name... Kim Shin?

312
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:03,490
Ten years ago, you came here with me. Am I correct?

313
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:08,200
And, at last, at a place where the memories of them together remained,

00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,690
I'm sorry.

629
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:59,830
Then, should we just end it here? I'll just get dumped.

630
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,730
Don't call me from now on.

631
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:05,470
If I said goodbye, I thought he might change his attitude.

632
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,570
But he didn't even hold on to me and just accepted my goodbye.

633
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:12,680
Did he even like me at all?

634
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:16,470
Did I dump her or...

635
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,950
did she dump me?

636
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,790
I loved her, but...

637
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,960
I couldn't hold onto her.

638
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,650
Before she struggles more...

639
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:30,130
Before I hurt her even more...

640
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,860
I decided to say goodbye to her...

641
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:34,600
To give back her ring...

642
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,550
I went to her store.

643
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:53,240
Is he about this tall?

644
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,200
And in the end...

645
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,150
she caught me.

646
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:12,810
The fact that I'm the Grim Reaper.

647
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:17,460
That's who you are...

648
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,640
I knew it couldn't be...

649
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:24,700
but I dreamed of a happy ending.

650
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:29,890
But as expected...

651
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,270
it's a tragedy.

652
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:39,120
Shall we...

653
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:44,580
just say goodbye?

654
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:57,890
That man is the Grim Reaper. Are there any obsessive female ghosts who come looking for him?

655
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:00,380
That was my first thought.

656
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:02,290
Even after I found out his identity...

657
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,040
my feelings toward him didn't change.

658
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,810
The kiss of a Grim Reaper...

659
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:13,410
brings back memories of past life.

660
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:21,040
In my past life, he was my love...

661
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:23,360
and pain.

662
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:26,670
The things I saw...

663
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:30,350
What was that?

664
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,850
By chance...

665
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:38,770
In your past life...

666
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:44,290
Am I in it?

667
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:48,510
Even in the past life...

668
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,830
I think I hurt her.

669
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:55,360
Except for the happiest moments...

670
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,730
Difficult and...

671
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,410
sad moments...

672
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:06,170
Forget all of it.

673
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,630
And...

674
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:16,600
Forget me, too.

675
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,610
Even if it's only you...

676
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:25,980
I wish you a happy ending even like this...

677
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:29,640
♬ I’ll certainly find you ♬

678
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,900
♬ I’ll recognize you ♬

679
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,520
While carrying out your duty...

680
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,970
we confirmed that you used your powers for personal reasons.

681
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:42,020
No...

682
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:45,340
Face your sins again.

683
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:51,130
Since then, for violating heaven's laws...

684
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:55,580
I was punished by remembering the sins of my past life.

685
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,170
That ring, I...

686
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:03,070
I put it on her so brutally.

687
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,380
On her finger...

688
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:08,370
It was me who hurt her...

689
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,020
and killed her...

690
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:15,010
The memories that flooded in agonized me.

691
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:19,020
Thankfully, I erased all of her painful memories.

692
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,990
All the painful...

693
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:34,910
You told me to remember just the happy moments and forget you. That's not the correct order.

694
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:41,060
All the moments you were there... including sad and difficult moments and all...

695
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:44,720
They were all good to me.

696
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,490
My memories with him did not disappear at all.

697
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:54,430
Even the difficult moments... during the time I spent with him, everything was happy to me.

698
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:59,410
Let's really break up. Goodbye, Your Majesty.

699
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:07,290
But he who caused so much pain in my past life... I don't think I could love him again.

700
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:11,760
Saying goodbye is the only punishment I can give him.

701
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:22,760
Nine years have passed by after having said goodbye to her like that.

702
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:29,210
Ever since the Goblin returned to nothing... people didn't remember me...

703
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,790
- Your name is?
- Wang Yeo.

704
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:35,770
I'm Sunny.

705
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:40,310
It seems Sunny doesn't remember me either now.

706
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:47,020
I wanted to see you. I saw the CCTV. Since I got to see you in person, I'll get going now.

707
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:51,930
It was nice to meet you.

708
00:42:54,840 --> 00:43:04,030
She couldn't remember me, but I was happy to have met her like this again.

709
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:13,500
It was nice to see you, Kim Woo Bin.

710
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:23,350
Actually, I clearly remembered the memories of my past life and this life with him...

711
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:26,880
But I pretended not to remember him.

712
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:32,960
He had me remember my past life and tried to erase it...

713
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,460
Wouldn't oblivion be God's consideration?

714
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:40,500
It's my memory and my life. How dare he be considerate without even asking me?

715
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:48,690
I said I'd live with painful memories of my love... I had told God not to get involved in my life.

716
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:53,990
Hopefully, in the next life...

717
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:58,790
we don't have to wait long, but get to spend a long time together...

718
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:05,030
As a perfect answer to love... I hope we meet like that.

719
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:08,190
Even though I love him, but can't...

720
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:13,960
Again, I will depart to a place where he can't find me.

721
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:22,050
I'll leave after counting up to 50. 48...

722
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,980
49...

723
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,460
One...

724
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:36,260
He found out that I remembered everything and came to me.

725
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:41,410
♫ I don’t know why my tears keep falling when I look at you ♫

726
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:46,670
In this lifetime...
♫ I don’t know why my tears keep falling when I look at you ♫

727
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:49,410
You won't see me again.

728
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:57,920
Like this, we said our last goodbyes again.

729
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:02,970
30 years after she left me, one day...

730
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:06,180
This is the last one.

731
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:13,750
With the news of termination of my punishment of living as a Grim Reaper, I received my list.

732
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:21,150
Her name is listed on the list.

733
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:28,080
She said she won't stay in touch... Even this must be our fate.

734
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:35,860
I wanted to put it on you properly for once.

735
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:40,130
I felt bad that I put it on you so cruelly.

736
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:44,700
We ended our lives together like this.

737
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:49,440
In our next life, hopefully we will be perfected in love...

738
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:55,320
I hope we don't have to wait long, but get to spend a long time together...

739
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:02,000
[Heartbreaking and sad love story, the two cannot continue on...]

740
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:09,010
Actually, I couldn't really date Sunny.

741
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:12,080
The sweet romance... wasn't quite there.

742
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:15,820
Yes, that's right. I was an idiot in the beginning.

743
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:18,040
In the beginning?

744
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:20,180
Was I always?

745
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:26,950
I was wondering how it could've been if we had showed the cute and sweet side of our love. But even still, our story...

746
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:30,850
did continue well, so the viewers...
[The Grim Reaper and Sunny's love story received lots of viewers' cheers and love]

747
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:33,500
- People cheered us on and understood us.
- They were loving to us...

748
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:37,380
I was so thankful. Thanks to you, I was able to do a good job. Thanks again.

749
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:41,800
Thank you.

750
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:45,040
Now that we've talked about our story...

751
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,660
We should take a look at the Peach couple's behind-the-scenes.

752
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:51,060
- Yes, yes. Shall we?
- Let's take a look at our behind-the-scenes.

753
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:54,400
[Happy ending in this life]

754
00:46:54,400 --> 00:47:00,350
It's our first day starting today.

755
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:04,000
[Sunny is recording the scene where she falls in shock hearing a phone ringing on an overpass where no one is around]

756
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,140
[Geez]

757
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:09,870
You were so awkward falling down...

758
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:14,880
- I didn't have to completely fall in this cut.
- You really want me to fall and crack my head, huh, Oppa?

759
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,950
Right, I'd be just watching you like this...

760
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:18,910
- Not saying anything?
- Yeah.

761
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:23,830
You won't step on me?
[You think I'd step on you?]

762
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:27,640
What do people do on a date at a coffee shop?

763
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:32,440
Give me some ideas. I've never been on a date in a coffee shop.

764
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,480
[For no reason, he hits.]
You're going to hit me now?

765
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,450
[Kiss, kiss!]

766
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:42,420
- It was in the script.
- You said you won't do it.

767
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:45,480
[I won't do it.]
But we ended up kissing, right?

768
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,540
The reason you shouldn't miss Goblin,

769
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:53,250
is the fact that all the actors appearing in the Goblin are all alive?

770
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:56,020
- Because we're not dead.
- Hey...

771
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:57,970
Seriously...

772
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:02,130
- I'm totally working on my image.
- Why?

773
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:05,800
I have to do a kiss scene.
[Grim Reaper has to do a kiss scene with Sunny]

774
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,960
[Excited, excited]
[Practicing the kiss scene by himself]

775
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,610
Huh?

776
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:14,980
Shouldn't the Grim Reaper be a bad kisser? Good thing you're doing it.

777
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:17,320
[Awkward, like this?]
No, not like that.

778
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,330
Forget it.

779
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:20,960
But that was the tearful kiss scene.

780
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,940
- That's right.
- We couldn't do it.

781
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:26,070
We couldn't do it. So disappointing. I was so disappointed.

782
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:31,220
Sunny... the character is so great. She's so charming.

783
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:33,550
I've never seen a character like that before.

784
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:37,920
She's so unique? Wondering, "Who's she?" Makes you keep watching her.

785
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,780
I think In Na approached the character very well.

786
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:47,520
We talked a lot about you when you weren't there. Me, Gong Yoo hyung, and Eun Tak.

787
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:51,940
That you approached the character so well. And more than what's written in the script...

788
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:55,920
your tone was so funny and so tasteful...

789
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,050
[Thanks, thanks]

790
00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:59,980
Sit down! Before I kill you.

791
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,370
So cute.

792
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:05,620
I'm so glad you played Sunny, In Na.

793
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:07,190
I really thank you.

794
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:09,500
[I was happy to play Sunny, too]

795
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:12,360
I'll read the next letter.

796
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:16,280
Someone with the ID, Buckwheat Eat Goblin, sent us this letter.

797
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:22,920
"I heard you took the story of Goblins from tales. Are Goblins and Grim Reapers in tales this cool?"

798
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:28,720
Since we don't know too much about this topic, we'll call up the expert and hear from him.

799
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,270
Okay.

800
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:34,950
[Recalling Narrative Tale]

801
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:38,340
We took the motif from the narrative tales.

802
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:40,980
There weren't that many people who researched the subject.

803
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:45,540
We used our imagination and made it possible for us to add on to it.

804
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:52,060
If the soul lands on an object that has been touched by people or blood...

805
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:54,700
you become a Goblin.

806
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,410
[When you know history, you see the future! Easy and fun interpretation of difficult Korean history, historical writer Shim Yong Hwan]

807
00:50:02,410 --> 00:50:05,480
The drama that took motifs from Goblin fairytales.

808
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:10,330
Up to what portion is it taken from tales and which portion came from the writer's creative writing?

809
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:14,520
We will take a look one at a time together.

810
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:19,810
First, the person of interest, the Goblin. Recalling Gong Yoo Goblin.

811
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:25,480
[You can call up the Goblin when you blow out a candle?]

812
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:29,840
Don't you want to call each other on the cell phone, set up a time and meet each other? Like modern people?

813
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:34,570
In the drama, the Goblin is called out when you blow out a candle.

814
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:41,320
But the Goblins in the fairy tales and legends historically don't appear in front of the people when you blow out the candle.

815
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:46,700
Of course, the recalling of the Goblin by candlelight isn't completely improbable.

816
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:54,180
If you look at the literary reference Seokbosangjeol from Joseon dynasty during the King Sejong years, people wished to Goblins good fortune and long life.

817
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:59,140
As for candlelight recall, it may have come from the idea of ancestral worship ceremony or something like that...

818
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:02,230
I carefully suggest that idea.

819
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:08,950
Don't call me out anymore. You don't need to do that anymore. I'll be by your side from now on.

820
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,890
[Goblin's healing place, buckwheat field]

821
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:16,250
[Goblin likes buckwheat?]

822
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:21,110
It wasn't simply that he liked buckwheat. In our modern terms, I think he was a buckwheat maniac.

823
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:26,140
When I look at my research, it's not that he liked the buckwheat flower in the drama in a romantic sense...

824
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:28,530
but he liked buckwheat very much as food.

825
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:31,180
When I take a look at the records in Jeungsando...

826
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:37,330
there are stories where people try to reel Goblins in by making food with buckwheat that Goblins like.

827
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:42,060
According to the legend in the Jeolla province, Goblins don't have intestines. Because of that...

828
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:48,370
they like buckwheat jello that is easy to digest. There are tales like that.

829
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:53,580
You won't die even though you don't have a stomach.

830
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:58,440
The second person of interest. Recalling Grim Reaper.

831
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:01,820
Born in the year Ge Choong, month Jeong Sa, day Eur Sa, fourth hour.

832
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:05,010
When a human dies, he brings them in to the world beyond.
[The Grim Reaper manages the dead]

833
00:52:05,010 --> 00:52:07,620
It's you, right?

834
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:10,240
When I die later, perhaps I should become a Grim Reaper like the Uncle down the hall.

835
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:14,290
I don't want to say this, but you have to commit a grave sin in your past life to become a Grim Reaper...

836
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:18,590
In the drama, it's said that someone with grave sin in the past life can become a Grim Reaper.

837
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:20,210
How did you find out?

838
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:23,790
There's no tale that says a sinner became a Grim Reaper.
[False]

839
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:25,870
Among Korean Narrative Literature...

840
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:30,920
there is a story of Master Kim who used to be a government official who becomes a Grim Reaper after his death.

841
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:35,820
But not because he was a criminal, but because he was a government official while he was alive...

842
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:38,180
that's how he came to work as an official of the dead.

843
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:42,610
Narrative tales develop over a long period of time and...

844
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:46,260
disappear, and transform. They go through these processes.

845
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:52,670
What I told you are some of the reasonable conclusions you can draw from these narrative tales.

846
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:56,380
The new process of developing stories of Goblins...

847
00:52:56,380 --> 00:53:00,350
I believe we enjoyed the time we spent doing that.

848
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:08,200
I'll move on to the next letter. ID is Ting-Kke-Bell.

849
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:13,640
Yook (Yook Sung Jae), Jal (Handsome), Tdoe (Again), heart, heart, heart. Our Deuk Hwa, our god, you were the best!

850
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:17,580
He said, "Please release all the behind-the-scenes of Yook Jal Tdoe."

851
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:19,850
Wow, our lovable Deok Hwa.

852
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:22,310
He was always so cute.

853
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:25,640
He's so hard-working and kind. He was really busy, you know.

854
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,780
- That's right.
- He had so many different things to do in his schedule.

855
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:33,400
As for behind-the-scenes from the filming location, we have lots of scenes for you on the Goblin Special Part 2 tomorrow. Please anticipate.

856
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:39,840
Today, Yook Sung Jae has sent us self-camera takes from the filming location himself.

857

This was our first meeting since we had no scenes together.

I told him at the wrap party that I am his fan.

895

I guess you didn't prepare certain things.

01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:39,170
[Candidate 2. Textbook of ad-libs, Goblin]
[The script was only up to "shut up"]

1079
01:04:37,870 --> 01:04:40,610
I love you, too... Mister.

1080
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:41,920
Shut up!

1081
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,470
- Love you...
- You insolent!
[With an extra line, this scene got even better.]

1082
01:04:43,470 --> 01:04:45,980
[Candidate 3. Yoo Deok Hwa, who came to love ad-libs. The script ended with the Goblin patting Deok Hwa's head.]
Are you really giving this to me, Uncle?

1083
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:47,520
This is a reward from me.

1084
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:48,680
I haven't done anything to deserve a reward though.

1085
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:51,210
You have worked hard to grow up well.

1086
01:04:51,210 --> 01:04:52,510
I love you.
[An ad-lib, "I love you," that melted the Goblin's heart.]

1087
01:04:52,510 --> 01:04:55,810
This kid...

1088
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:03,870
[Guess the master of the best ad-libs?]

1089
01:05:03,870 --> 01:05:07,310
[The most humorous scene, Grim Reaper!]

1090
01:05:07,310 --> 01:05:08,910
[Two times medalist!]

1091
01:05:08,910 --> 01:05:10,730
Double medals!

1092
01:05:10,730 --> 01:05:16,210
Thank you. I got to be a two-time medalist including the most humorous scene.

1093
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:19,740
I will share this honor with Sunny.

1094
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:21,670
- That, that. Please ask me that.
- Which one?
- "What is your hobby?"

1095
01:05:21,670 --> 01:05:23,670
What is your hobby?

1096
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:23,980
Sunny.

1097
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:25,980
What is your hobby?

1098
01:05:24,810 --> 01:05:26,280
Sunny!

1099
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:29,010
Thank you.

1100
01:05:29,010 --> 01:05:30,520
[Ad-libs that weren't aired!]

1101
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:33,450
White pants, white pants!

1102
01:05:38,610 --> 01:05:40,270
I did it earlier.

1103
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:43,050
[Didn't know~]

1104
01:05:43,050 --> 01:05:46,820
I'm so happy. Even though it's not real, I'm happy to be awarded.
- Of course.
[The radio booth brightened up]

1105
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:51,420
It feels like we split the rewards among ourselves but it still feels good to be awarded.

1106
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:54,790
Yes, I'm happy. By the way, Dong Wook, you should treat us to something since you got double medals.

1107
01:05:54,790 --> 01:05:58,010
Because I got two medals? Alright. I will treat you to anything you want.

1108
01:05:58,010 --> 01:06:00,010
[The Grim Reaper has a heart and a wallet as wide as the Pacific Ocean]
Okay, okay.

1109
01:05:58,970 --> 01:06:00,770
3,000 won ($3) per person.

1110
01:06:00,770 --> 01:06:02,510
[He is a master of ad-libs, for sure.]

1111
01:06:02,510 --> 01:06:05,140
Congratulations for getting the Toughest Scene.

1112
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:08,330
Congratulations for getting the Cutest Scene and the Most Humorous Scene.

1113
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:10,330
Alrighty.

1114
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:13,700
So from our first meeting to God (scene) ordainment, we got to watch

1115
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:17,420
the Goblin Summon Special part 1, Summon to the living.

1116
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:20,120
How was it? This special episode?

1117
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:23,350
They were the scenes that weren't aired.

1118
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:28,920
So it was really fun. It felt like looking back on our memories, rather than working.

1119
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:30,920
You are right.

1120
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:30,640
I enjoyed it very much.

1121
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:35,790
When I heard we were airing special episodes, I wished that day would come soon and waited so much.

1122
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:38,220
Since we could watch this before anyone else...

1123
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:39,510
That's right. It's an honor.

1124
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:41,470
- Yes.
- I'm so happy we could see it early.

1125
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:45,280
But on the other hand, it's kind of sad, too. The show is really over.

1126
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:48,610
That's why we are reviewing the old memories.

1127
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:52,570
I'm sure there are many people who feel just like me.
[Viewers who feel sad and bittersweet!]

1128
01:06:52,570 --> 01:06:57,440
- Right.
- But we are allowed a little more time to be with Goblin, right?

1129
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:02,270
Yes, that's right. At the same time tomorrow. For the first time in our nation.
[Feb 4, 6:40 pm]

1130
01:07:02,270 --> 01:07:06,550
I mean, for the first time in this lifetime, we are going to show you more behind-the-scenes.

1131
01:07:06,550 --> 01:07:10,810
We will come back with Special episode 2.

1132
01:07:10,810 --> 01:07:12,610
Please look forward to it.

1133
01:07:12,610 --> 01:07:14,910
Alright. We will see you tomorrow then.

1134
01:07:14,910 --> 01:07:17,920
Bye~!!

1135
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:22,010
Pray with all your heart. We will show you the behind-the-scenes that were never aired.

1136
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:26,920
♬ You're so beautiful. You're beautiful. I said you're beautiful ♬

1137
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:29,110
I can do it! Please give me a kiss.

1138
01:07:29,110 --> 01:07:30,880
- Thank you.
- Fighting!

1139
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,650
- What are you doing?
- What, why?

1140
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:35,480
I'm being competitive.

1141
01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:36,410
Did Dong Wook do this?

1142
01:07:36,410 --> 01:07:41,680
Freeze.

1143
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:43,610
Right, right.

1144
01:07:43,610 --> 01:07:44,720
Do I get up and go next to him?

1145
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:49,590
- Cut, okay.
- Didn't the camera just come into the the frame?

1146
01:07:49,590 --> 01:07:51,180
The viewers don't think it's a CG.

1147
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:52,650
Our drama is all about CG, you know.

1148
01:07:52,650 --> 01:07:56,440
Please catch the original airing! You know what I mean?
