You okay?

That could've been bad!

00:03:11.786 --> 00:03:14.586
Just 10cm over

00:03:14.586 --> 00:03:16.866

you're in luck!

Since we're in the boonies,

00:04:30.256 --> 00:04:34.056
it was hard to get the parts.
I barely managed to do it.

00:04:34.056 --> 00:04:37.376
You see?
They're all genuine parts.

00:04:37.376 --> 00:04:40.216
I fixed it real good
with genuine parts.

00:04:40.416 --> 00:04:41.976
so about 10 years?

00:04:41.976 --> 00:04:45.096
Nah, you're good
for 20 years or more.

00:04:45.096 --> 00:04:47.056
Sir, this is quite pricey.

00:04:47.416 --> 00:04:50.096
Don't know about that,
you should ask her.

00:04:50.176 --> 00:04:54.256

I was driving through there.

go bury it properly!

Let's take it apart.

00:05:51.856 --> 00:05:55.296
Let go, I'm taking them back.

00:05:55.296 --> 00:05:57.216

00:05:57.816 --> 00:05:58.656
Here, take it.

00:05:58.656 --> 00:06:01.496
It's so well built
it won't come off.

00:06:01.496 --> 00:06:03.336
Good bye, take care.

00:06:03.376 --> 00:06:04.576

It should be illegal for someone
preggers to talk like that.

I'm so sick of it,
she's practically a vegetarian.

He's getting remarried, huh?

00:07:12.496 --> 00:07:14.136
He's too old for that.

00:07:14.136 --> 00:07:15.816
Did you catch a cold?

00:07:15.816 --> 00:07:18.736
Don't even mention it.

00:07:18.896 --> 00:07:21.296

She's got to take care of
her young mother-in-law.

00:07:25.696 --> 00:07:27.016
I wouldn't do it.

00:07:27.016 --> 00:07:28.776

00:07:37.896 --> 00:07:39.296
When you were a virgin.

into a horndog when drunk.

- Get away!
- Idiot!

Here I go!

00:08:58.736 --> 00:09:00.736
I lost again!

at this rate.

00:09:11.536 --> 00:09:12.616
You got a wig?

00:09:12.616 --> 00:09:14.736
I'm a groom after all.

00:09:17.136 --> 00:09:19.376

00:09:20.136 --> 00:09:21.456

00:09:34.896 --> 00:09:38.136

00:09:40.656 --> 00:09:42.456

00:09:45.256 --> 00:09:46.616
What's with him?

00:09:48.776 --> 00:09:50.376
Get the hell away!

00:09:51.096 --> 00:09:55.096
You bastard!
Wait till I get my hands on you!

00:10:03.416 --> 00:10:06.216
I've had it...

00:10:07.736 --> 00:10:09.936
What a shitty day.

00:10:26.416 --> 00:10:27.776

00:10:29.216 --> 00:10:30.776

00:10:39.536 --> 00:10:41.056
Come out!

00:10:43.176 --> 00:10:44.736
Right this second!

00:10:49.536 --> 00:10:52.856

00:10:55.496 --> 00:10:57.176

00:10:59.096 --> 00:11:02.096

00:11:08.696 --> 00:11:10.696
You disrespectful brat! Take this!

00:11:11.976 --> 00:11:14.056
What was that?

00:11:19.416 --> 00:11:21.616
Get that scum! Get him!

00:11:21.776 --> 00:11:23.696
What happened?

00:11:25.976 --> 00:11:27.176

Hey Girl!

00:12:57.796 --> 00:12:59.876
It's your bro...

00:13:16.396 --> 00:13:17.756
Oh, hi Min-gul!

00:13:17.756 --> 00:13:18.636
What's with him?

00:13:18.636 --> 00:13:20.396
I don't know, just run!

00:13:24.236 --> 00:13:28.796
Min-gul!

00:13:51.756 --> 00:13:52.836
What in the world...

00:13:52.836 --> 00:13:55.356
I can't look...

00:13:56.236 --> 00:13:58.836
What happened? Is he dead?

00:13:59.876 --> 00:14:00.836
He's moving.

00:14:00.836 --> 00:14:02.076
What?

00:14:03.316 --> 00:14:04.996
He's not dead.

00:14:05.676 --> 00:14:06.996
You there!

00:14:07.796 --> 00:14:09.516
Are you okay?

00:14:10.356 --> 00:14:11.716
You okay?

00:14:12.356 --> 00:14:16.156
I didn't mean
to hit you back there!

00:14:16.396 --> 00:14:18.796
Say something, buddy.

00:14:18.796 --> 00:14:20.436
You're the one who hit him.

00:14:20.436 --> 00:14:22.596
- He's fine.
- When did you arrive?

00:14:22.676 --> 00:14:23.956
Just now.

00:14:24.076 --> 00:14:25.276
My brakes are busted!

00:14:25.276 --> 00:14:26.956
My truck's brakes!

00:14:26.996 --> 00:14:29.076
I always meant to fix them...

00:14:31.556 --> 00:14:32.916
Where is he going?

00:14:33.196 --> 00:14:34.756
Where are you going?

00:14:36.816 --> 00:14:38.696
He must've hit his head.

00:14:40.816 --> 00:14:42.736
Made in USA.

00:14:42.776 --> 00:14:44.256
It's American-made, your favorite.

00:14:44.256 --> 00:14:46.576
That's not important right now.

00:14:47.296 --> 00:14:50.616
What if that guy comes back
pretending to be injured?

00:14:50.616 --> 00:14:53.096
How would he know where
to find you?

00:14:53.296 --> 00:14:56.416
How many tow truck drivers
are there in this town?

00:14:56.936 --> 00:14:57.776
It's just me.

00:14:57.776 --> 00:14:58.976
Like he had a chance to look,

00:14:58.976 --> 00:15:00.696
you took him out in a flash.

00:15:00.696 --> 00:15:03.416
I didn't take out anything,
don't say that.

00:15:03.416 --> 00:15:05.496
Don't go around saying that.

00:15:07.136 --> 00:15:08.416
You prick...

00:15:09.256 --> 00:15:11.456
I was kidding!

00:15:11.976 --> 00:15:13.736
It was self-defense anyway.

00:15:13.736 --> 00:15:17.656
That pervert was going
to rape Hye-gul.

00:15:19.816 --> 00:15:20.936
What?

00:15:21.136 --> 00:15:22.256
Rape?

00:15:22.336 --> 00:15:23.576
Who?

00:15:25.016 --> 00:15:27.216
Are you okay?

00:15:27.826 --> 00:15:30.666
Some hobo was chasing me,

00:15:30.666 --> 00:15:32.346
but Jun-gul blew him away.

00:15:32.346 --> 00:15:34.266
I didn't blow anyone away!

00:15:34.266 --> 00:15:36.266
It's not like he was a bomb!

00:15:37.106 --> 00:15:40.426
It was nothing at all,
not a damn thing.

00:15:40.546 --> 00:15:43.266
Don't get stressed over it.

00:15:45.666 --> 00:15:46.866
What's that?

00:15:51.786 --> 00:15:54.426
Father, are you okay?

00:15:54.426 --> 00:15:56.066
Move!

00:15:59.786 --> 00:16:02.186
Did he get into a fight
while playing cards again?

00:16:02.186 --> 00:16:03.386
He got bit by a dog.

00:16:03.386 --> 00:16:05.706
It wasn't a damn dog!

00:16:06.386 --> 00:16:08.346
Just wait till I catch that prick.

00:16:08.346 --> 00:16:12.146
I'll bite him back,
I swear to god!

00:16:12.746 --> 00:16:15.546
I gave him a shot,
so he'll be fine.

00:16:16.026 --> 00:16:17.826
If he gets a fever,
give me a call.

00:16:17.826 --> 00:16:19.786
- Thanks.
- Take care.

00:16:19.786 --> 00:16:23.586
How dare he bite me,
I'm Park Man-duk!

00:16:23.586 --> 00:16:25.546
What's happening?

00:16:29.506 --> 00:16:32.506
Nothing's changed.

00:16:44.826 --> 00:16:49.026
Hey!
Someone take care of that mutt!

00:16:58.706 --> 00:17:01.746
So nice, that's where I should be.

00:17:02.786 --> 00:17:05.626
You always begged me
to go to Hawaii,

00:17:06.106 --> 00:17:07.945
what was the rush?

00:17:08.018 --> 00:17:10.058
Wait a bit, it's almost ready.

00:17:12.946 --> 00:17:16.306
Summer's over,
but why's it so hot?

00:17:26.646 --> 00:17:29.406
Why am I sweating so much?

00:17:40.906 --> 00:17:42.786
How can they fire me with a text?

00:17:42.806 --> 00:17:45.146
(You are dismissed
effective immediately)

00:17:45.193 --> 00:17:47.033
Lame ducks.

00:18:24.506 --> 00:18:25.906
Who's there?

00:18:28.705 --> 00:18:30.385
Who the hell are you?

00:18:34.166 --> 00:18:35.446
Hye-gul,

00:18:35.539 --> 00:18:37.099
what are you doing in the dark?

00:18:37.152 --> 00:18:38.472
There...

00:18:49.586 --> 00:18:51.266
You punk!

00:18:51.626 --> 00:18:53.586
There you are!

00:18:59.866 --> 00:19:03.266
Min-gul! Wake up!

00:19:06.866 --> 00:19:08.146
Nam-ju!

00:19:10.146 --> 00:19:13.506
You stupid punk! Take this!

00:19:18.726 --> 00:19:19.926
Father!

00:19:24.606 --> 00:19:26.126
Out of the way!

00:19:37.466 --> 00:19:39.186
Can't I just sleep?

00:19:39.186 --> 00:19:41.946
What's all the commotion?
Can't you see it's late?

00:19:42.266 --> 00:19:43.866
What are you all looking at?

00:19:44.196 --> 00:19:45.236
Father...

00:19:49.156 --> 00:19:51.036
Who... killed him?

00:19:51.156 --> 00:19:52.636
- Jun-gul?
- No, no...

00:19:52.836 --> 00:19:54.036
Father?

00:19:54.556 --> 00:19:56.036
Jun-gul kicked him!

00:19:56.796 --> 00:19:58.196
Why did you fly kick him?

00:19:58.196 --> 00:20:01.356
No, I, uh, I didn't mean to...

00:20:01.356 --> 00:20:03.796
Why is bad things keep happening?

00:20:10.996 --> 00:20:13.196
He's moving! He's alive!

00:20:25.356 --> 00:20:27.236
It's him from before, right?

00:20:27.236 --> 00:20:28.956
Yeah, it's him!

00:20:28.956 --> 00:20:30.276
What? Who is he?

00:20:30.276 --> 00:20:31.436
I don't know.

00:20:31.436 --> 00:20:33.476
That guy who was blown away
by Jun-gul's truck.

00:20:33.476 --> 00:20:35.316
Is he here for revenge?

00:20:35.316 --> 00:20:36.716
It's him,

00:20:37.316 --> 00:20:38.276
the guy who bit my head.

00:20:38.276 --> 00:20:39.436
I thought a dog bit you.

00:20:39.436 --> 00:20:41.396
I told you it wasn't a dog!

00:20:42.796 --> 00:20:45.556
How did he know where we live?

00:20:45.556 --> 00:20:48.596
That's not important,
do something about him!

00:20:48.596 --> 00:20:49.556
I did everything I can,

00:20:49.556 --> 00:20:50.756
he's immortal!

00:20:50.756 --> 00:20:52.316
Do something.

00:20:52.316 --> 00:20:55.756
Yeah! He's that thing!

00:20:55.756 --> 00:20:56.956
What thing?

00:20:59.926 --> 00:21:01.526
Come on, follow me!

00:21:01.926 --> 00:21:03.446
What is it?

00:21:33.606 --> 00:21:34.806
Come!

00:21:47.366 --> 00:21:48.566
Guys...

00:21:50.366 --> 00:21:52.086
What'll happen to me?

00:21:53.726 --> 00:21:54.966
Father!

00:22:00.406 --> 00:22:02.006
What should we do?

(Zombie virus)

(The Living Dead:
Is The Zombie Virus Real?)

00:22:28.056 --> 00:22:29.936
Incubation period...

00:22:36.216 --> 00:22:37.496
Let's eat.

00:22:38.396 --> 00:22:41.396
The living must go on living.

00:22:51.836 --> 00:22:54.196
Are you a pig?

00:22:55.156 --> 00:22:57.716
Father's on the brink of death.

00:22:57.836 --> 00:22:59.156
You call yourself his daughter?

00:22:59.156 --> 00:23:02.276
How can you eat in this situation?

00:23:04.076 --> 00:23:07.156
Eat mine too, it looks delicious.

00:23:07.156 --> 00:23:08.396
Don't eat it then.

00:23:08.396 --> 00:23:09.676
I won't.

00:23:09.676 --> 00:23:11.556
- Go sleep it off!
- I don't want to.

00:23:11.556 --> 00:23:12.876
So childish.

00:23:12.876 --> 00:23:14.876
Look who's talking.

00:23:15.596 --> 00:23:17.076
Didn't you see?

00:23:17.476 --> 00:23:20.476
Those bitten by a zombie
turn right away.

00:23:20.476 --> 00:23:22.356
Take dad to the hospital.

00:23:22.356 --> 00:23:24.916
He was bitten by a dog.

00:23:26.516 --> 00:23:28.716
Do you even use your brain?

00:23:28.956 --> 00:23:31.156
You ignorant idiots.

00:23:33.716 --> 00:23:36.876
It's called an 'incubation
period.' Do you understand?

00:23:36.889 --> 00:23:40.156
(Zombie Survival Guide)

00:23:40.716 --> 00:23:44.356
'Hardcolo human H349-N virus.'

00:23:45.196 --> 00:23:48.436
In layman's terms,
it's known as 'zombie virus.'

00:23:48.596 --> 00:23:49.436
When this virus enters the body,

00:23:49.436 --> 00:23:50.676
it mutates the DNA.

00:23:50.676 --> 00:23:51.916
Wait a minute.

00:23:51.996 --> 00:23:52.956
I know what that is,

00:23:52.956 --> 00:23:55.796
it's in tuna, it makes you smart.

00:23:56.036 --> 00:23:58.756
That's DHA, this is DNA.

00:23:58.756 --> 00:24:01.236
- Continue.
- It's different?

00:24:02.156 --> 00:24:02.996
Once bitten,

00:24:02.996 --> 00:24:06.436
the virus spreads all over
the body via blood vessels.

00:24:06.716 --> 00:24:09.716
And the body temperature
and blood pressure rises.

00:24:10.076 --> 00:24:12.556
Convulsions are next.

00:24:13.076 --> 00:24:14.556
Imperceptible at first,

00:24:14.796 --> 00:24:17.796
then they intensify,
and it looks like a seizure.

00:24:20.956 --> 00:24:23.156
Look at this idiot.

00:24:27.036 --> 00:24:30.516
Then very slowly...

00:24:30.916 --> 00:24:34.556
The soul escapes the body.

00:24:34.756 --> 00:24:37.636
Very slowly...

00:24:39.276 --> 00:24:40.756
Alright!

00:24:41.076 --> 00:24:42.756
You almost startled my kid
to death.

00:24:42.756 --> 00:24:44.236
Are you okay?

00:24:44.316 --> 00:24:45.956
Goddamn scum.

00:24:49.276 --> 00:24:51.116
Okay, listen carefully.

00:24:51.116 --> 00:24:53.396
This is very important.

00:24:54.716 --> 00:24:57.796
Re-vi-val.

00:25:04.316 --> 00:25:05.596
It comes back to life.

00:25:07.956 --> 00:25:11.076
In an immortal body,
it's brought back to life.

00:25:22.876 --> 00:25:24.716
Like resurrection?

00:25:24.876 --> 00:25:26.636
Do you go to church nowadays?

00:25:26.636 --> 00:25:28.596
It's very different.

00:25:28.596 --> 00:25:30.716
They lack souls,
only instincts remain.

00:25:30.716 --> 00:25:31.996
Especially their appetite.

00:25:31.996 --> 00:25:34.796
They'll bite anything, viciously.

00:25:37.156 --> 00:25:40.156
Here's a question,
what do they like the best?

00:25:43.556 --> 00:25:45.276
Human brain.

00:25:46.676 --> 00:25:48.596
They'll chomp on anything.

00:25:53.716 --> 00:25:55.436
What the hell?

00:25:55.556 --> 00:25:58.156
So what's the takeaway?

00:26:02.716 --> 00:26:04.276
We have to kill it.

00:26:05.796 --> 00:26:08.276
You unfilial scum!

00:26:19.396 --> 00:26:21.396
We really have to kill it!

00:26:21.396 --> 00:26:24.436
It's not our dad anymore!

00:26:24.596 --> 00:26:27.796
Your petty affection
will get us all killed!

00:26:27.796 --> 00:26:29.556
Shut the hell up!

00:26:29.556 --> 00:26:32.076
Stop saying nonsense
and just go home!

00:26:32.076 --> 00:26:33.356
Look, I researched all night
at the internet café!

00:26:33.356 --> 00:26:34.636
A famous Russian geneticist

00:26:34.636 --> 00:26:36.716
extracted rabies from a dog...

00:26:36.716 --> 00:26:37.796
Get it out of my face!

00:26:37.796 --> 00:26:39.996
Listen to me! We could all die!

00:26:40.436 --> 00:26:42.636

for the sake of the baby...

00:26:58.876 --> 00:27:00.996
How are you feeling?

00:27:18.956 --> 00:27:20.996
Die, you zombie creep!

00:27:21.196 --> 00:27:23.436
Stop right there!

00:27:26.036 --> 00:27:27.756
You piece of shit!

00:27:27.756 --> 00:27:29.436
Piss off!

00:27:29.516 --> 00:27:31.676
I told you, it's not our father!

00:27:31.756 --> 00:27:35.116
Don't ever come back,
you savage bastard!

00:28:18.316 --> 00:28:19.756
What's your name?

00:28:22.356 --> 00:28:23.196
At least have the decency

00:28:23.196 --> 00:28:25.876
to answer me!

00:28:29.076 --> 00:28:30.676
Can't you talk?

00:28:37.816 --> 00:28:40.749

00:29:02.996 --> 00:29:06.396
I'll be back later,
stay right here.

00:29:08.036 --> 00:29:10.676
Got it, Zzongbie?

That's his third cabbage.

00:29:49.276 --> 00:29:50.556
Hye-gul.

00:29:53.036 --> 00:29:55.236
Could you step outside for a bit?

00:30:13.356 --> 00:30:15.796
I don't know what you are,

00:30:16.916 --> 00:30:19.516
but this is the only way
for us to live.

00:30:37.396 --> 00:30:39.436
Go exercise.

00:30:44.036 --> 00:30:44.876
Man-duk!

00:30:44.876 --> 00:30:47.356
Man-duk, please help me!

00:30:47.436 --> 00:30:49.036
My wedding is in two days!

00:30:49.036 --> 00:30:50.476
Congrats!

00:30:50.476 --> 00:30:53.196
Please, what did you eat?

00:30:53.196 --> 00:30:54.476
Ginseng?

00:30:54.476 --> 00:30:55.316
Wild ginseng?

00:30:55.316 --> 00:30:56.596
He pisses like a young man!

00:30:56.596 --> 00:30:58.956
Like hell I had wild ginseng.

00:30:58.956 --> 00:31:01.476
I've always been strong!

00:31:01.476 --> 00:31:04.356
No way, just look at your face!

00:31:04.356 --> 00:31:07.276
You've become so young!

00:31:07.876 --> 00:31:09.156
Let me see.

00:31:18.396 --> 00:31:19.596
But how?

00:31:28.176 --> 00:31:30.416
You cutie pie!

00:31:32.376 --> 00:31:34.496
It was you, right?

00:31:34.696 --> 00:31:36.176
You did this to me?

00:31:36.176 --> 00:31:39.656
What a cutie! It was you!

00:31:40.016 --> 00:31:45.176
My life is finally turning around
before I die!

00:31:45.176 --> 00:31:48.336
I'm so happy! This is incredible!

00:31:48.336 --> 00:31:49.816
Look at him.

00:31:50.136 --> 00:31:52.496
The virus is spreading
all over its brain.

00:31:53.096 --> 00:31:55.216
It must be eliminated
before it's too late.

00:31:57.616 --> 00:32:00.136
I'll eliminate you! Come here!

00:32:00.136 --> 00:32:02.056
- Come here, buddy!
- It's not our dad!

00:32:03.866 --> 00:32:04.906
Man-duk!

00:32:05.626 --> 00:32:06.586
Are you in there?

00:32:06.586 --> 00:32:07.826
That idiot...

00:32:07.826 --> 00:32:09.706
Where did he go?

00:32:09.706 --> 00:32:10.986
Wait a minute...

00:32:18.226 --> 00:32:19.186
Is he inside?

00:32:19.186 --> 00:32:22.546
Hey, Wig,
what are you doing over there?

00:32:23.106 --> 00:32:24.386
Go away.

00:32:24.626 --> 00:32:26.226
Something's here, right?

00:32:26.586 --> 00:32:28.666
Man-duk!

00:32:29.186 --> 00:32:31.586
We don't have long to live anyway.

00:32:31.666 --> 00:32:37.466
Let me be a good husband
to a young bride before I die.

00:32:39.426 --> 00:32:41.626
How much? This much?

00:32:41.626 --> 00:32:42.826
$10?

00:32:42.946 --> 00:32:46.666
Come on,
I come from an orchard family.

00:32:46.746 --> 00:32:48.706
Then $100? That's it?

00:32:48.906 --> 00:32:52.226
How much is a plane ticket
to Hawaii?

00:33:02.836 --> 00:33:07.356
I'm taking pity on you,
so come quietly.

00:33:07.356 --> 00:33:10.556
- Okay, okay.
- Don't tell the others, alright?

00:33:10.556 --> 00:33:14.276
Did something really happen
yesterday?

00:33:14.796 --> 00:33:18.756
Now that I look at it,
your bite mark is gone.

00:33:21.736 --> 00:33:25.296
'I love you,' I love you.

00:33:25.456 --> 00:33:28.216
'I'm sorry,' I'm sorry.

00:33:28.296 --> 00:33:31.776
'I'm hungry,' I'm hungry.

00:33:31.856 --> 00:33:35.776
'How much, how much, how much'...

00:33:36.376 --> 00:33:37.376
How much?

00:33:37.376 --> 00:33:38.336
Huh?

00:33:38.336 --> 00:33:39.696
Man-duk.

00:33:42.496 --> 00:33:45.096
Don't we deserve to be young too?

00:33:45.096 --> 00:33:46.096
That's right.

00:33:46.096 --> 00:33:48.416
We're not going to lie down
and just die.

00:33:48.536 --> 00:33:49.816
Let's do it together.

00:33:51.096 --> 00:33:53.096
That mouth of yours.

00:33:55.776 --> 00:33:58.176
So you hid it in here?

00:33:58.176 --> 00:33:59.136
Shut it,

00:33:59.136 --> 00:34:01.376
just know that
it's your lucky day!

00:34:01.856 --> 00:34:04.456
Eh? Where did he go?

00:34:06.976 --> 00:34:09.576
Yo, Kim! Have you been well?

00:34:10.056 --> 00:34:12.736
Didn't you say
your team was researching Viagra?

00:34:13.296 --> 00:34:14.576
What happened to it?

00:34:16.016 --> 00:34:19.256
That's right, rascal,
you're so damn lucky!

00:34:19.736 --> 00:34:22.256
I'm heading up
with an amazing specimen.

00:34:22.736 --> 00:34:25.216
Yeah, I'll call you
when I get there.

00:34:37.176 --> 00:34:38.136
You were speeding,

00:34:38.136 --> 00:34:40.296
may I see your license?

00:34:40.376 --> 00:34:43.536
What the hell for?

00:34:43.696 --> 00:34:45.576
Jun-gul, you got a call?

00:34:45.576 --> 00:34:46.576
Eh?

00:34:46.576 --> 00:34:48.936
You're doing great work
around the clock.

00:34:48.936 --> 00:34:51.536
Look who it is, it's Min-gul!

00:34:51.536 --> 00:34:52.976
Have you been well?

00:34:52.976 --> 00:34:54.736
Yes, of course.

00:34:55.016 --> 00:34:58.856
Where's your brother?
Are you helping out?

00:34:58.896 --> 00:35:00.336
Come on now.

00:35:00.336 --> 00:35:03.176
It's a nice day,
I'm out on a drive.

00:35:04.656 --> 00:35:05.936
With this truck?

00:35:06.176 --> 00:35:08.336
What's wrong with this?

00:35:08.336 --> 00:35:10.736
Indeed, it's got four wheels.

00:35:11.456 --> 00:35:12.456
When did you come home?

00:35:12.456 --> 00:35:14.616
A couple of days ago.

00:35:14.856 --> 00:35:18.056
Why didn't you come
say hello first?

00:35:18.086 --> 00:35:20.966
Are you ignoring your old friends?

00:35:20.966 --> 00:35:23.326
Like hell! Me?

00:35:23.326 --> 00:35:25.366
Why would I ignore you?

00:35:25.366 --> 00:35:27.966
You're still an bastard.

00:35:27.966 --> 00:35:30.646
The day one changes
is the day one dies.

00:35:31.126 --> 00:35:32.486
All right, have a good drive.

00:35:32.486 --> 00:35:33.726
See you.

00:35:33.726 --> 00:35:37.046
Officer Choi, what are you doing?
Let's go, I'm hungry.

00:35:37.046 --> 00:35:38.286
Okay.

00:35:45.686 --> 00:35:47.566
What was that?

00:35:53.806 --> 00:35:55.006
Stop!

00:36:03.166 --> 00:36:04.766
Officer Park! Look!

00:36:04.766 --> 00:36:06.926
- What's this?
- Dammit!

00:36:08.926 --> 00:36:11.606
- Stop right there!
- Officer Choi! Hey!

00:36:14.806 --> 00:36:18.046
I was a human rights movement
leader in college.

00:36:18.046 --> 00:36:19.806
This is uncalled
for in a democratic nation!

00:36:19.806 --> 00:36:21.126
Uncuff me!

00:36:21.126 --> 00:36:24.446
You got no right to bark,
uncross your feet!

00:36:25.326 --> 00:36:26.326
Beating him up wasn't enough,

00:36:26.326 --> 00:36:28.566
were you going to bury him?

00:36:28.606 --> 00:36:30.366
Bury him? Jesus!

00:36:30.366 --> 00:36:33.366
I'll tell you everything,
all right?

00:36:33.366 --> 00:36:36.606
Uncuff me, it hurts like hell.

00:36:36.726 --> 00:36:38.406
He's right, chief.

00:36:38.686 --> 00:36:41.206
Min-gul is not the type.

00:36:41.566 --> 00:36:44.666
Buddy! Tell chief the truth right
this second!

00:36:44.666 --> 00:36:46.066
Bullshit, look at his face,

00:36:46.066 --> 00:36:47.546
is that a face of a man?

00:36:47.546 --> 00:36:50.586
His face was always like that!

00:36:50.586 --> 00:36:52.026
Shut the hell up!

00:36:52.026 --> 00:36:55.066
Choi, why haven't you removed
the tape?

00:36:55.066 --> 00:36:56.946
Don't remove the tape, just don't!

00:36:56.946 --> 00:36:59.106
If you do, we're all dead!

00:37:00.186 --> 00:37:01.546
Holy shit!

00:37:01.866 --> 00:37:03.266
It's all gone?

00:37:06.506 --> 00:37:09.306
- You bastard!
- No, I didn't do this!

00:37:09.306 --> 00:37:11.626
I really didn't, say something!

00:37:11.626 --> 00:37:13.866
Tell them I didn't do this!

00:37:16.986 --> 00:37:19.546
He's acting, give him an Oscar.

00:37:19.546 --> 00:37:21.866
I've had it with you!

00:37:22.346 --> 00:37:23.546
You beat him so much

00:37:23.546 --> 00:37:26.506
that he's drooling all over.

00:37:27.346 --> 00:37:29.386
Choi, lock this bastard up.

00:37:29.386 --> 00:37:32.346
Chief, please!
I'll tell you everything.

00:37:32.426 --> 00:37:34.866
The cat's out of the bag,
I'll tell you everything...

00:37:35.506 --> 00:37:36.786
Come close.

00:37:36.786 --> 00:37:38.146
Closer.

00:37:39.866 --> 00:37:42.946
He's... not a human.

00:37:43.066 --> 00:37:46.226
He's not, he's a corpse.

00:37:46.346 --> 00:37:49.146
Ever heard of the walking dead?
It's a zombie.

00:37:51.146 --> 00:37:52.426
- Lock the door.
- Yes, sir!

00:37:52.426 --> 00:37:54.226
I'm going to kill him today.

00:37:55.226 --> 00:37:56.226
You're so dead!

00:37:56.226 --> 00:37:59.226
Chief! Don't get all worked up!

00:38:00.106 --> 00:38:01.546
Who was it?

00:38:02.706 --> 00:38:04.906
Who kidnapped my baby?

00:38:07.866 --> 00:38:09.026
- Father?
- Hello, sir.

00:38:09.026 --> 00:38:10.546
- Park!
- Zzongbie!

00:38:10.546 --> 00:38:15.026
Yeah, Jongbie,
he's my youngest son!

00:38:15.186 --> 00:38:16.466
- Pardon?
- What?

00:38:16.466 --> 00:38:17.426
Eh?

00:38:17.426 --> 00:38:18.986
Your son is right here.

00:38:19.106 --> 00:38:20.186
Chief Oh.

00:38:20.186 --> 00:38:23.786
Don't get involved
in our family affairs.

00:38:24.706 --> 00:38:27.626
Go! Take him outside!

00:38:27.626 --> 00:38:28.586
Let's go Zzongbie.

00:38:28.586 --> 00:38:29.866
What the hell's going on here?

00:38:29.866 --> 00:38:32.266
Hye-gul, I did it all for you...

00:38:35.146 --> 00:38:36.146
Hey, come back!

00:38:36.146 --> 00:38:37.146
One moment!

00:38:37.146 --> 00:38:39.306
- Take care.
- What about Min-gul?

00:38:39.306 --> 00:38:40.266
Leave him?

00:38:40.266 --> 00:38:42.386
Father, take me with you.

00:38:43.546 --> 00:38:46.066
What are you doing?
Move out of the way!

00:38:46.146 --> 00:38:47.346
Just go!

00:38:49.186 --> 00:38:51.146
I have a brother
I never knew I had.

00:38:51.146 --> 00:38:52.586
Uncuff me.

00:38:52.586 --> 00:38:53.986
Father!

00:39:02.626 --> 00:39:05.706
So you mean, your bite mark...

00:39:05.706 --> 00:39:09.466
Anyway, I'm flying out to Hawaii,

00:39:09.546 --> 00:39:11.306
so the rest is up to you.

00:39:11.306 --> 00:39:12.706
Stop saying that,

00:39:12.706 --> 00:39:15.906
we'll get you a ticket soon!

00:39:17.706 --> 00:39:19.066
Okay!

00:39:19.106 --> 00:39:22.026
When he flies out,
I'm taking that boy!

00:39:22.066 --> 00:39:22.906
Right?

00:39:22.906 --> 00:39:26.826
Why are you taking him?

00:39:27.746 --> 00:39:28.946
What?

00:39:29.586 --> 00:39:32.786
What's wrong? Are you sick of it?

00:39:38.186 --> 00:39:40.226
If anyone even comes
close to the farm,

00:39:40.226 --> 00:39:41.426
I'll kill you.

00:39:42.786 --> 00:39:43.626
Got it?

00:39:43.626 --> 00:39:45.506
You're going to profit off
of him by yourself?

00:39:45.506 --> 00:39:47.986
I heard you chatting
with Mr. Lee behind the farm!

00:39:47.986 --> 00:39:51.506
Good, I knew we were alike.

00:39:51.866 --> 00:39:53.226
He's mine!

00:39:53.226 --> 00:39:54.226
So long as he lives here,

00:39:54.226 --> 00:39:55.186
he's mine!

00:39:55.186 --> 00:39:56.746
Finders, keepers!

00:39:56.746 --> 00:39:57.706
I'm the finder too,

00:39:57.706 --> 00:39:59.426
you see my head?

00:39:59.426 --> 00:40:00.826
Once he enters this house,

00:40:00.826 --> 00:40:03.666
he's a shared asset!

00:40:05.066 --> 00:40:06.946
Where are your teeth?

00:40:08.106 --> 00:40:09.146
Who did this?

00:40:09.146 --> 00:40:10.226
If you're going to cause trouble,

00:40:10.226 --> 00:40:11.906
pack up and head home!

00:40:11.986 --> 00:40:14.266
Why are you all on my ass?

00:40:14.266 --> 00:40:15.226
Father and Nam-ju messed
with him too,

00:40:15.226 --> 00:40:17.186
so why me?

00:40:17.186 --> 00:40:18.706
You bastard!

00:40:21.826 --> 00:40:22.946
Are you okay?

00:40:22.946 --> 00:40:25.066
I didn't mean to hit you...

00:40:25.066 --> 00:40:27.146
Forget it, don't touch me!

00:40:27.146 --> 00:40:28.746
You idiot!

00:40:28.746 --> 00:40:29.906
You think I'm doing this

00:40:29.906 --> 00:40:32.266
because of Hawaii?

00:40:33.866 --> 00:40:36.666
You may be guilty
of being born as my sons,

00:40:38.186 --> 00:40:40.146
but why does your wife
deserve this?

00:40:41.506 --> 00:40:43.026
Jun-gul, you idiot.

00:40:43.146 --> 00:40:45.386
Will you raise your child

00:40:45.546 --> 00:40:48.106
in this dusty shithole?

00:40:48.146 --> 00:40:49.466
Will you?

00:40:50.426 --> 00:40:54.586
Let's bring back this gas station!

00:40:56.666 --> 00:40:58.706
I won't live very long.

00:40:59.426 --> 00:41:00.546
What's mine is also yours.

00:41:00.546 --> 00:41:03.146
Who was it?
Who pulled out his teeth?

00:41:06.826 --> 00:41:09.026
Oh my, oh my!

00:41:10.346 --> 00:41:11.626
Who was it?

00:41:12.346 --> 00:41:13.666
Who did this?

00:41:14.506 --> 00:41:16.106
It wasn't me.

00:41:19.746 --> 00:41:23.386
It's all over...

00:41:24.946 --> 00:41:28.266
This isn't all bad, I'll take him.

00:41:29.186 --> 00:41:30.386
Father.

00:41:30.546 --> 00:41:33.726
Why don't you go to Hawaii
and get some rest?

00:41:33.726 --> 00:41:36.766
I'll buy you a new house too.

00:41:46.606 --> 00:41:47.926
Move!

00:41:48.566 --> 00:41:49.606
Father!

00:41:52.126 --> 00:41:55.206
Snail!

00:42:04.126 --> 00:42:06.686
This is a bit unnerving...

00:42:08.006 --> 00:42:08.926
You go first.

00:42:08.926 --> 00:42:10.686
- Me?
- Yeah.

00:42:10.686 --> 00:42:12.046
You should go first.

00:42:12.046 --> 00:42:13.886
I said you go first!

00:42:13.886 --> 00:42:15.326
Come on!

00:42:15.326 --> 00:42:18.406
Not going to do it?
The sun will rise at this rate!

00:42:18.566 --> 00:42:20.046
Just do it.

00:42:20.406 --> 00:42:22.846
Out of the way, you pricks!

00:42:23.646 --> 00:42:25.526
I'll go first!

00:42:41.366 --> 00:42:42.446
Is it working?

00:42:42.446 --> 00:42:44.126
Just wait a bit.

00:42:52.886 --> 00:42:55.366
Buddy, what's wrong?

00:42:55.966 --> 00:42:59.206
It's meat, your favorite.

00:42:59.366 --> 00:43:02.726
This isn't some child's play,
what's the point?

00:43:09.526 --> 00:43:10.646
Eat up.

00:43:16.006 --> 00:43:18.606
You're going to kill me! Stop it!

00:43:29.646 --> 00:43:30.966
He's laughing!

00:43:33.966 --> 00:43:35.806
- You're leaving?
- Bye!

00:44:39.726 --> 00:44:42.086
One! Two! Three!

00:44:46.086 --> 00:44:47.446
Allow me!

00:44:47.806 --> 00:44:49.246
Put it down.

00:44:58.446 --> 00:45:00.566
Isn't that Mr. Snail?

00:45:03.406 --> 00:45:05.486
Is it Jackpot? Is he coming?

00:45:05.546 --> 00:45:07.106
What is it?

00:45:07.506 --> 00:45:08.946
What's going on?

00:45:12.146 --> 00:45:14.466
It's all gone.

00:45:20.119 --> 00:45:23.246
(I'm leaving)

00:45:49.666 --> 00:45:51.226
Let's go quietly.

00:46:08.066 --> 00:46:10.666
Hey Girl!
I'll make a ton of money!

00:46:11.026 --> 00:46:12.066
Hey!

00:46:12.146 --> 00:46:13.666
Where are you going?

00:46:18.146 --> 00:46:20.506
I'm going to eradicate...

00:46:23.946 --> 00:46:26.946
the seeds of the Park family.

00:46:27.506 --> 00:46:31.066
- You ignorant housewife!
- Get back here!

00:46:31.066 --> 00:46:32.986
- You got it all wrong!
- Stop right there!

00:46:32.986 --> 00:46:35.066
What a messed up family.

00:46:35.066 --> 00:46:37.466
I just wanted to check!

00:46:37.546 --> 00:46:38.786
What happened?

00:46:38.786 --> 00:46:40.946
Are you deaf?

00:46:41.106 --> 00:46:42.306
Look!

00:46:48.746 --> 00:46:51.826
Father, did you give him money?

00:46:51.986 --> 00:46:54.866
You moron, nothing's free!

00:46:54.866 --> 00:46:57.066
Goddammit!

00:47:00.636 --> 00:47:01.836
Let's go!

00:47:03.636 --> 00:47:05.996
Come on!

00:47:22.756 --> 00:47:25.316
Zzongbie, be careful, you'll trip!

00:48:04.166 --> 00:48:06.366
You like it that much?

00:48:12.166 --> 00:48:15.566
Say it after me, Hye-gul.

00:48:19.816 --> 00:48:21.506
Not like that.

00:48:21.506 --> 00:48:23.266
Hye-gul!

00:48:27.266 --> 00:48:29.386
Are you really a zombie?

00:48:36.556 --> 00:48:38.916
No more cabbage
until you say it right.

00:48:54.726 --> 00:49:00.046
Feels like I'm born again

00:49:00.446 --> 00:49:06.566
Everything about me has changed

00:49:07.206 --> 00:49:09.606
After meeting you

00:49:09.606 --> 00:49:13.766
I've become a new person

00:49:13.766 --> 00:49:20.046
My mother is surprised the most

00:49:24.726 --> 00:49:30.046
As soon as I wake up
in the morning

00:49:30.486 --> 00:49:36.486
I play the song you recommended

00:49:37.126 --> 00:49:43.646
For some reason, I really like it

00:49:43.646 --> 00:49:50.006
even though
I can't remember the title...

00:49:51.646 --> 00:49:53.846
Goddamn idiot! How dare you!

00:49:55.766 --> 00:49:57.966
Who were you going to bite, huh?

00:49:58.926 --> 00:50:01.846
Are you okay? Did he bite you?

00:50:01.966 --> 00:50:04.046
Let me see you.

00:50:04.486 --> 00:50:05.886
Your face is red!

00:50:05.886 --> 00:50:08.926
Stop it! It's just hot!

00:50:09.846 --> 00:50:12.926
You bastard!

00:50:12.926 --> 00:50:16.246
Go away, piss off, scum!

00:50:16.766 --> 00:50:19.606
This is all your fault.

00:50:19.846 --> 00:50:23.406
None of this would've happened
if you didn't show up.

00:50:23.806 --> 00:50:25.246
My father wouldn't have left...

00:50:25.566 --> 00:50:26.686
Jun-gul.

00:50:26.766 --> 00:50:28.766
The source of all our trouble...

00:50:28.766 --> 00:50:31.456
Not that, the men!

00:50:31.456 --> 00:50:32.936
What?

00:50:34.496 --> 00:50:36.496
Where's that mob going?

00:50:36.496 --> 00:50:40.136
Please!
Calm down and listen to me!

00:50:40.256 --> 00:50:42.096
My poor sister-in-law...

00:50:42.736 --> 00:50:45.296
You lived
with a nasty father-in-law,

00:50:45.416 --> 00:50:47.296
and an incompetent husband,

00:50:47.296 --> 00:50:49.576
a life full of hardships, no?

00:50:50.016 --> 00:50:51.496
And Hye-gul,

00:50:52.096 --> 00:50:54.536
she never got to see her mom,

00:50:54.536 --> 00:50:56.736
do you know what my wish is?

00:50:57.816 --> 00:51:02.056
For our family to live proudly!

00:51:02.456 --> 00:51:05.376
I heard that story yesterday too.

00:51:05.376 --> 00:51:07.536
What do you want me to do?

00:51:13.216 --> 00:51:14.576
What is it?

00:51:17.376 --> 00:51:18.456
Who's that?

00:51:18.456 --> 00:51:20.096
Isn't that Jun-gul?

00:51:24.496 --> 00:51:25.976
What's he saying?

00:51:27.776 --> 00:51:32.512
(W-E A-R-E S-C-R-E-W-E-D!)

00:51:34.336 --> 00:51:36.212
(W-H-A-T?)

00:51:50.902 --> 00:51:54.589
(R-U-N!)

00:51:56.576 --> 00:51:58.656
We're so screwed!

00:52:02.656 --> 00:52:04.736
Shut the windows
and draw the curtains!

00:52:14.056 --> 00:52:15.376
Jun-gul!

00:52:15.536 --> 00:52:19.096
Are you inside? Come on out.

00:52:19.416 --> 00:52:23.456
This is because we scammed
the villagers with father...

00:52:23.586 --> 00:52:24.626
I knew this'd happen!

00:52:24.626 --> 00:52:25.786
I told you I'd take him!

00:52:25.786 --> 00:52:26.826
Shut the hell up!

00:52:26.826 --> 00:52:29.046
They can hear us,
you stupid moron!

00:52:29.046 --> 00:52:31.046
Hey, Park Jun-gul!

00:52:31.046 --> 00:52:33.026
If you're inside,
come outside for a bit!

00:52:33.026 --> 00:52:35.746
The elders told us everything!

00:52:36.626 --> 00:52:39.106
Come on out!

00:52:39.106 --> 00:52:40.826
Who brought that scumbag?

00:52:40.866 --> 00:52:42.786
Come forward and redeem yourself!

00:52:42.786 --> 00:52:44.746
We saw you run inside!

00:52:44.746 --> 00:52:47.426
Boys! Come on out!

00:52:47.866 --> 00:52:50.826
I brought so many customers!

00:52:53.026 --> 00:52:57.746
Jun-gul, I want to have a kid too!

00:52:58.066 --> 00:52:59.106
Move aside!

00:53:00.066 --> 00:53:02.746
I'll pay double, do me first!

00:53:15.786 --> 00:53:18.226
Line up!

00:53:30.426 --> 00:53:35.586
Feels like I'm born again

00:53:36.146 --> 00:53:42.266
Everything about me has changed

00:53:42.906 --> 00:53:45.426
After meeting you

00:53:45.426 --> 00:53:49.506
I've become a new person...

00:53:53.106 --> 00:53:55.426
Line up!

00:54:06.226 --> 00:54:09.086
There's no refund,
if you lose your ticket!

00:54:09.086 --> 00:54:12.926
Show me your ticket,
one at a time please.

00:54:13.006 --> 00:54:14.126
I'll give you another.

00:54:14.126 --> 00:54:17.206
Not here, line up over there!

00:54:17.206 --> 00:54:19.686
Go over there!

00:54:37.246 --> 00:54:38.446
Nice, eh?

00:54:52.006 --> 00:54:53.206
Hey, Hye-gul.

00:55:02.086 --> 00:55:03.766
Am I straight?

00:55:03.766 --> 00:55:05.926
Alright, come on!

00:55:05.966 --> 00:55:08.046
Come on! Come on!

00:55:08.326 --> 00:55:12.166
(Zzongbie)

00:55:18.526 --> 00:55:20.726
It was my idea.

00:55:24.486 --> 00:55:26.166
It's your home.

00:55:37.916 --> 00:55:39.876
Zzongbie, look over here.

00:55:40.516 --> 00:55:46.076
I don't even look at

00:55:46.356 --> 00:55:52.796
pretty girls in the subway anymore

00:55:52.996 --> 00:55:59.676
In a few stops, you'll be there

00:55:59.676 --> 00:56:05.716
My reflection in the window
smiles back at me...

00:56:10.556 --> 00:56:13.076
Your boyfriend is a hottie.

00:56:13.636 --> 00:56:16.796
No! He's not my boyfriend.

00:56:17.396 --> 00:56:20.236
Why is his face so pale?

00:56:21.516 --> 00:56:23.556
Stay still.

00:56:42.236 --> 00:56:43.876
Hey, look over there.

00:56:44.916 --> 00:56:46.116
What is it?

00:56:46.956 --> 00:56:48.276
Is he a celebrity?

00:56:48.276 --> 00:56:50.196
- He's hot.
- Is he new?

00:56:50.196 --> 00:56:51.436
- I know, right?
- You know him?

00:56:51.436 --> 00:56:53.516
- Nope.
- I've never seen him before.

00:56:53.516 --> 00:56:55.716
Who's the chicken head
in front of him?

00:56:55.756 --> 00:56:57.036
What the hell?

00:57:02.196 --> 00:57:03.236
What's she doing?

00:57:03.236 --> 00:57:04.476
Eat up.

00:57:10.996 --> 00:57:12.436
Let's get a move on!

00:57:12.436 --> 00:57:16.196
Give that a rest,
you'll lose the kid!

00:57:20.796 --> 00:57:22.796
Buddy! Do the other side too!

00:57:24.876 --> 00:57:27.556
He's been cleaning
that spot for an hour.

(Poongsan Gas Station)

00:57:47.516 --> 00:57:49.116
Are you crying?

00:57:50.076 --> 00:57:52.276
I'm not crying...

00:57:52.596 --> 00:57:55.356
I got something in my eye.

00:57:55.476 --> 00:57:56.736
Your eyes are red...

00:57:56.736 --> 00:58:00.496
To commemorate our reopening
after the 10-year break,

00:58:00.936 --> 00:58:03.096
let's all take a photo.

00:58:03.496 --> 00:58:05.816
All right, smile, everyone.

00:58:07.296 --> 00:58:08.776
Get over here!

00:58:10.416 --> 00:58:12.456
One, two, three!

00:58:17.936 --> 00:58:20.856
My god, this is delicious!

00:58:20.896 --> 00:58:24.256
I wish everyday was like today!

00:58:24.256 --> 00:58:25.896
That's my only wish!

00:58:25.896 --> 00:58:27.616
By the way, why is he here?

00:58:28.456 --> 00:58:31.136
We decided to eat together
from today.

00:58:31.216 --> 00:58:33.936
Like a family,
we got to eat together.

00:58:34.176 --> 00:58:36.176
Of course, that's what
being a family is like.

00:58:36.176 --> 00:58:39.456
Eat together, shit together
and sleep together.

00:58:39.576 --> 00:58:41.096
Like hell.

00:58:41.576 --> 00:58:44.776
When I first saw him,

00:58:45.136 --> 00:58:48.496
I got this feeling, eh?
Think about it.

00:58:48.656 --> 00:58:50.536
Of all the houses in this village,

00:58:50.536 --> 00:58:52.856
he came to ours.

00:58:52.856 --> 00:58:56.616
Is that a coincidence?
No, it's fate.

00:58:56.616 --> 00:58:59.336
Complete fate.

00:59:00.376 --> 00:59:01.976
Have a drink.

00:59:02.136 --> 00:59:05.176
You must've been feeling rough,

00:59:05.576 --> 00:59:06.696
take a drink like a man

00:59:06.696 --> 00:59:09.136
and wash all that away.

00:59:09.656 --> 00:59:12.296
And call me 'brother.'

00:59:12.296 --> 00:59:13.776
Jesus.

00:59:13.776 --> 00:59:15.456
He's just a kid!

00:59:16.216 --> 00:59:18.976
- He is?
- Just look at him.

00:59:19.336 --> 00:59:21.536
Zzongbie, try this.

00:59:30.856 --> 00:59:32.336
Hey Girl!

00:59:32.336 --> 00:59:34.576
Why is your face turning red?

00:59:34.816 --> 00:59:36.736
- No way.
- It's so red!

00:59:36.749 --> 00:59:39.709
I'm sitting in front of the fire!

00:59:40.936 --> 00:59:43.136
What has that got to do
with anything?

00:59:43.166 --> 00:59:45.086
I'm in front of the fire,
it's really hot!

00:59:45.086 --> 00:59:46.486
That makes your face red?

00:59:46.486 --> 00:59:48.326
- Will it go blue, then?
- What?

00:59:49.646 --> 00:59:51.046
She's so red!

00:59:51.046 --> 00:59:53.606
It's really hot
in front of the fire!

00:59:53.606 --> 00:59:56.006
But why is your face red?

01:00:05.886 --> 01:00:07.046
Do I look like someone

01:00:07.046 --> 01:00:08.286
who'll rot in the boonies?

01:00:08.286 --> 01:00:10.526
Just get my money ready.

01:00:11.046 --> 01:00:14.006
Let me ask you something,
for that examination,

01:00:14.246 --> 01:00:16.446
it's just a simple checkup, right?

01:00:16.566 --> 01:00:18.446
No need for autopsy or anything.

01:00:18.806 --> 01:00:20.486
What?

01:00:20.566 --> 01:00:22.606
I'm certain it's not human.

01:00:24.446 --> 01:00:26.086
I wasn't fired!

01:00:26.086 --> 01:00:27.846
A man must dream big!

01:00:27.846 --> 01:00:30.126
Drive a Mercedes,
fly out to Saipan.

01:00:37.046 --> 01:00:38.656
He's still at it?

01:00:38.656 --> 01:00:42.016
Let him be, he's CSI now.

01:00:42.216 --> 01:00:44.496
TV ruins kids nowadays.

01:00:44.496 --> 01:00:47.536
So very hygienic,
brush over there.

01:00:47.536 --> 01:00:48.656
Sorry, sir.

01:00:48.656 --> 01:00:50.856
Chief! Take a look at this!

01:00:51.936 --> 01:00:53.536
The Parks were acting weird,

01:00:53.616 --> 01:00:56.736
so I took
Park Jongbie's fingerprints.

01:00:57.296 --> 01:00:58.656
Take a look!

01:00:58.656 --> 01:01:00.936
Korean adult male.
Not in the database.

01:01:00.936 --> 01:01:04.096
Or he was never registered
in the first place.

01:01:05.496 --> 01:01:07.016
Should I report it to the HQ?

01:01:08.456 --> 01:01:10.096
Do your damn job.

01:01:10.616 --> 01:01:11.816
Sir?

01:01:11.936 --> 01:01:13.096
Buddy,

01:01:13.096 --> 01:01:15.256
I don't know
how things are done in Seoul,

01:01:15.256 --> 01:01:18.016
but this happens
from time to time here.

01:01:18.286 --> 01:01:20.406
When a baby is born weird,

01:01:20.406 --> 01:01:22.686
he's not registered,

01:01:22.686 --> 01:01:25.086
and when he's got a debt,

01:01:25.086 --> 01:01:28.286
he gets his own death certificate.

01:01:28.286 --> 01:01:32.406
He did feel a bit weird, eh?

01:01:32.406 --> 01:01:34.526
More than just a bit.

01:01:39.126 --> 01:01:41.006
Bride and groom, enter!

01:01:53.206 --> 01:01:54.926
- Jun-gul, hey!
- Good to see you.

01:01:54.926 --> 01:01:56.406
Hello there.

01:01:57.006 --> 01:01:59.366
The entire village is so upbeat
thanks to you.

01:01:59.366 --> 01:02:01.806
- Take a look!
- We didn't do much.

01:02:02.126 --> 01:02:03.206
Oh yeah, take this.

01:02:03.206 --> 01:02:06.006
We're reopening, help us out.

01:02:06.006 --> 01:02:07.446
What's this?

01:02:07.846 --> 01:02:11.566
Then you're not doing this
anymore?

01:02:11.566 --> 01:02:12.486
Cows need grass,

01:02:12.486 --> 01:02:14.886
this is our business.

01:02:15.126 --> 01:02:16.406
Take care.

01:02:17.726 --> 01:02:20.006
Why is it so damn hot in here?

01:02:20.006 --> 01:02:21.446
Is the AC on?

01:02:23.086 --> 01:02:24.486
The summer's long over...

01:02:24.486 --> 01:02:25.806
Let me get some air too!

01:02:25.806 --> 01:02:27.646
It's so hot!

01:02:30.286 --> 01:02:33.126
(Su-geun)

01:02:38.926 --> 01:02:40.686
Isn't my mom pretty?

01:02:44.486 --> 01:02:47.446
Do you know
what the villagers call me?

01:02:50.286 --> 01:02:51.686
Mommy killer'.

01:02:53.286 --> 01:02:55.566
She died while giving birth to me.

01:02:56.806 --> 01:02:59.006
But I think I am, too.

01:03:00.246 --> 01:03:02.726
That's why
I'm sorry to my brothers,

01:03:04.566 --> 01:03:06.766
and even more to dad.

01:03:10.006 --> 01:03:11.646
If I didn't exist...

01:03:34.986 --> 01:03:36.126
(Zzongbie)

01:03:36.145 --> 01:03:37.526
Hey buddy!

01:03:39.166 --> 01:03:42.006
Take a trip to Seoul with me.

01:03:42.326 --> 01:03:43.606
Zzongbie?

01:03:45.726 --> 01:03:47.046
Where did he go?

01:03:47.486 --> 01:03:50.286
Run away if you see any people.

01:03:50.966 --> 01:03:54.006
Stay away from everyone,
you hear me?

01:03:56.126 --> 01:03:58.326
Don't make that weird sound too!

01:03:59.526 --> 01:04:02.046
Keep your mouth shut
and you'll be fine.

01:04:02.286 --> 01:04:03.806
Don't you forget it!

01:04:04.606 --> 01:04:07.806
Even if someone attacks you,
don't try to fight.

01:04:07.806 --> 01:04:10.286
Don't start a fight
or get beaten up either!

01:04:11.606 --> 01:04:12.686
Got it?

01:04:15.286 --> 01:04:18.406
See this? Use it like this.

01:04:30.486 --> 01:04:32.006
Bye, Zzongbie.

01:04:38.206 --> 01:04:39.406
Go!

01:04:44.766 --> 01:04:46.206
Don't follow me!

01:04:49.366 --> 01:04:51.366
Stop following me!

01:05:06.026 --> 01:05:07.306
Zzongbie!

01:05:09.746 --> 01:05:11.066
Zzongbie!

01:05:11.586 --> 01:05:13.306
Where are you?

01:05:14.146 --> 01:05:15.426
Zzongbie!

01:05:16.306 --> 01:05:17.666
Zzongbie!

01:05:36.546 --> 01:05:38.746
Meet good people,

01:05:41.146 --> 01:05:43.066
not people like us.

01:05:56.186 --> 01:05:58.826
To Seoul, two tickets
for the next bus.

01:06:05.626 --> 01:06:07.266
Don't run, boys!

01:06:11.186 --> 01:06:12.386
Zzongbie.

01:06:13.186 --> 01:06:17.026
I'll go buy us some drinks,
so stay right here.

01:06:17.506 --> 01:06:20.746
There are really bad men around.

01:06:21.866 --> 01:06:23.266
I'll be right back!

01:06:33.956 --> 01:06:35.596
Check out please!

01:06:41.516 --> 01:06:42.996
I'll just leave it here!

01:06:50.796 --> 01:06:52.916
You may kiss the bride.

01:07:20.436 --> 01:07:22.436
This is Poongsan Police.

01:07:23.996 --> 01:07:26.636
Where? Bus terminal?

01:07:27.956 --> 01:07:29.716
A fight broke out?

01:07:34.156 --> 01:07:35.996
What in the world...

01:07:47.316 --> 01:07:50.396
You rascal,
I knew this'd happen...

01:08:02.436 --> 01:08:04.476
Get back! Go away!

01:08:04.476 --> 01:08:06.876
I'm not delicious! Go away!

01:08:12.156 --> 01:08:14.636
Out of the way! Don't touch me!

01:09:10.076 --> 01:09:11.436
I'm going to go!

01:09:11.436 --> 01:09:13.556
Don't come back
if you're not going to buy...

01:09:18.876 --> 01:09:21.676
You shouldn't be eating
black bean noodles!

01:09:21.676 --> 01:09:24.996
You've got to eat healthy,
you understand?

01:09:26.036 --> 01:09:27.636
Welcome!

01:09:41.196 --> 01:09:43.796
Zzongbie, why are you back...

01:09:49.476 --> 01:09:50.756
Sir?

01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:02.196
- Hye-gul!
- Hye-gul!

01:10:02.196 --> 01:10:04.836
We brought a load of food
just for you!

01:10:04.836 --> 01:10:07.396
Jun-gul! Help!

01:10:07.796 --> 01:10:09.996
So much delicious food,
what's wrong?

01:10:11.956 --> 01:10:13.956
Hye-gul, what's wrong?

01:10:16.356 --> 01:10:17.796
Isn't that Choon-sam?

01:10:19.716 --> 01:10:23.276
Are you drunk in broad daylight?

01:10:23.836 --> 01:10:25.636
Did you get into
a drunken fight again?

01:10:25.636 --> 01:10:27.876
That's good,
have another drink with me.

01:10:27.876 --> 01:10:30.396
Don't go, he's weird!

01:10:30.476 --> 01:10:31.516
How come?

01:10:36.636 --> 01:10:38.116
What was that for?

01:10:39.756 --> 01:10:42.276
He was running at me.

01:10:42.276 --> 01:10:45.116
What?
Do you enjoy hitting people now?

01:10:45.116 --> 01:10:46.836
It was reflex!

01:10:46.836 --> 01:10:47.676
Are you okay?

01:10:47.676 --> 01:10:49.996
Don't move! Put your hands up!

01:10:50.556 --> 01:10:51.806
You are all under arrest
for assault

01:10:51.806 --> 01:10:54.326
and attempted murder!

01:10:54.326 --> 01:10:56.526
Drop everything
and put your hands up!

01:10:56.526 --> 01:10:59.126
Officer Choi, I think
there's some misunderstanding...

01:10:59.126 --> 01:11:00.646
Shut your mouth!

01:11:00.646 --> 01:11:02.072
How many have you killed

01:11:02.072 --> 01:11:05.232
in this remote garage?

01:11:05.486 --> 01:11:06.606
What are you talking about?

01:11:06.606 --> 01:11:07.926
Shut up!

01:11:08.166 --> 01:11:09.246
Where's Mr. Park Jongbie?

01:11:09.246 --> 01:11:11.966
Zzong... Where is he?
Is he inside?

01:11:13.126 --> 01:11:16.366
Have you killed him
like the others?

01:11:16.566 --> 01:11:17.646
Officer Choi,

01:11:18.086 --> 01:11:20.886
you're talking out of your ass!

01:11:20.886 --> 01:11:22.046
Shut up!

01:11:25.726 --> 01:11:27.726
- Are you okay, sir?
- You okay?

01:11:27.726 --> 01:11:29.166
Are you all right?

01:11:30.686 --> 01:11:31.766
- Come over here!
- Your nose...

01:11:31.766 --> 01:11:33.206
You're in danger, come over here!

01:11:33.206 --> 01:11:35.846
His nose is messed up...

01:11:36.406 --> 01:11:37.446
Why is his nose so messed up?

01:11:37.446 --> 01:11:38.966
Stay behind me!

01:11:39.486 --> 01:11:41.726
They're heinous criminals!

01:11:42.126 --> 01:11:43.206
I'll arrest them

01:11:43.206 --> 01:11:45.166
and take you to the ER.

01:11:49.486 --> 01:11:50.686
Pardon?

01:12:03.196 --> 01:12:05.076
- Honey!
- Choon-sam, what are you...

01:12:05.076 --> 01:12:06.636
Jun-gul, get back!

01:12:06.636 --> 01:12:08.436
Why did you bite him for?

01:12:13.476 --> 01:12:16.476
What... what are they doing?

01:12:22.996 --> 01:12:23.836
Why are you ganging up on us?

01:12:23.836 --> 01:12:25.196
Don't come near us!

01:12:25.196 --> 01:12:29.036
Stay back! I'll shoot!

01:12:33.676 --> 01:12:35.996
Shut it! Shut it!

01:12:39.356 --> 01:12:40.476
Hurry up!

01:12:40.476 --> 01:12:42.076
Move! Move!

01:12:47.636 --> 01:12:51.436
That window! Barricade it now!

01:12:55.676 --> 01:12:58.036
Is that you, Sung-sik?

01:12:58.196 --> 01:13:00.396
What happened to you, bud?

01:13:00.676 --> 01:13:03.796
It's me, Jun-gul,
your 6th grade partner!

01:13:03.796 --> 01:13:07.556
There's no damn time
for a school reunion!

01:13:07.556 --> 01:13:09.196
Just kill him!

01:13:09.516 --> 01:13:11.236
You don't remember?

01:13:12.276 --> 01:13:13.316
You remember?

01:13:14.956 --> 01:13:19.076
Let go of me!
I'm your friend Jun-gul!

01:13:23.076 --> 01:13:24.516
Shut the window.

01:13:25.716 --> 01:13:27.796
There are more coming!

01:13:28.156 --> 01:13:29.596
Let's go upstairs!

01:13:29.676 --> 01:13:31.716
Hye-gul! Hurry!

01:13:34.236 --> 01:13:36.316
Shut the windows
and draw the curtains!

01:13:41.846 --> 01:13:43.126
Flip it over!

01:13:45.926 --> 01:13:48.286
What in the world is going on?

01:13:48.806 --> 01:13:52.046
Wait, so Min-gul was right
all along?

01:13:52.526 --> 01:13:54.366
Where did he go?

01:13:56.886 --> 01:13:57.926
Ow!

01:13:59.286 --> 01:14:01.566
What is it? Your belly?

01:14:02.206 --> 01:14:03.926
Is he coming?

01:14:04.106 --> 01:14:07.546
It's okay, I was just startled.

01:14:08.666 --> 01:14:09.506
Nam-ju!

01:14:09.506 --> 01:14:11.412
(Zombie Survival Guide)

01:14:15.532 --> 01:14:17.372
This is it!

01:14:25.466 --> 01:14:27.226
Honey, this too!

01:14:34.132 --> 01:14:35.456
Here, use this!

01:14:35.456 --> 01:14:37.496
I need one with the handle.

01:14:40.056 --> 01:14:41.816
Jackpot, wrap it tightly.

01:14:41.816 --> 01:14:43.376
Jackpot's most important.

01:14:50.376 --> 01:14:51.656
I can't breathe.

01:14:51.656 --> 01:14:53.136
Water, I need water.

01:14:54.016 --> 01:14:55.216
So hot...

01:15:22.466 --> 01:15:23.866
- Is this 911?
- Yes.

01:15:23.866 --> 01:15:26.186
A horde of zombies is amassing.

01:15:26.186 --> 01:15:29.426
It may be hard to believe
but there really are zombies.

01:15:30.026 --> 01:15:31.906
Come rescue me right away!

01:15:32.786 --> 01:15:33.626
I'm at...

01:15:33.626 --> 01:15:36.226
Sir, you can be fined
for prank calls.

01:15:36.226 --> 01:15:39.026
What? Hello?

01:15:41.066 --> 01:15:43.266
How could she hang up on me?

01:15:54.346 --> 01:15:55.906
Turn off!

01:16:50.386 --> 01:16:52.026
Move! Move!

01:17:01.706 --> 01:17:03.386
Son of a...

01:17:07.466 --> 01:17:10.026
Back off! I'm a cop!

01:17:17.666 --> 01:17:21.066
Hye-gul, just hold on,
your brother's coming.

01:17:42.406 --> 01:17:44.526
Look at Officer Choi!

01:17:44.806 --> 01:17:47.126
He's walking around
covered in blood!

01:17:47.166 --> 01:17:50.806
As the infection spreads,
the transformation speeds up.

01:17:50.806 --> 01:17:52.846
Who said that?

01:17:57.526 --> 01:18:00.006
Any mention of this on TV?

01:18:00.406 --> 01:18:01.806
Nothing at all.

01:18:01.806 --> 01:18:03.206
Give me that.

01:18:06.646 --> 01:18:08.126
Dammit...

01:18:08.486 --> 01:18:12.246
How can they not know
about this damn mess?

01:18:12.446 --> 01:18:14.926
Maybe because
we're in the boonies.

01:18:17.886 --> 01:18:19.166
Be quiet!

01:18:19.846 --> 01:18:21.646
What's wrong? Is it your belly?

01:18:22.046 --> 01:18:23.246
I'm fine,

01:18:23.766 --> 01:18:26.366
he's not due for a few more days.

01:18:26.886 --> 01:18:28.806
Just breathe, breathe!

01:18:30.046 --> 01:18:32.086
Goddamn it...

01:18:33.246 --> 01:18:35.966
This is all his fault,
he planned this all along...

01:18:36.102 --> 01:18:38.156
Why is this his fault?

01:18:38.156 --> 01:18:39.396
Then whose fault is it?

01:18:39.396 --> 01:18:41.916
This whole thing happened
because he bit everyone!

01:18:41.916 --> 01:18:43.156
It's our fault,

01:18:43.156 --> 01:18:44.656
we told him to bite...

01:18:44.656 --> 01:18:46.136
How is this our fault?

01:18:46.176 --> 01:18:48.776
Think about it,
who was bitten first?

01:18:49.016 --> 01:18:50.502
He bit our dad!

01:18:50.502 --> 01:18:53.262
Am I right or not?

01:19:11.336 --> 01:19:12.576
Honey!

01:19:18.136 --> 01:19:21.016
They came up! What do we do?

01:19:21.776 --> 01:19:24.136
Window! Hye-gul! To the window!

01:19:25.856 --> 01:19:28.496
What are you doing? Get over here!

01:19:29.616 --> 01:19:32.976
You go first and help Nam-ju out!

01:19:33.616 --> 01:19:35.496
Be careful, you hear?

01:19:39.336 --> 01:19:40.656
Where did she go?

01:19:42.976 --> 01:19:44.456
Honey!

01:20:08.276 --> 01:20:09.756
Honey, hurry!

01:20:12.436 --> 01:20:14.316
Let go of me, you lowlife!

01:20:20.556 --> 01:20:21.876
Nam-ju, be careful!

01:20:22.676 --> 01:20:23.956
Let's move!

01:20:31.676 --> 01:20:34.516
Get to the vent! Be careful!

01:20:45.156 --> 01:20:46.636
Nam-ju!

01:20:46.756 --> 01:20:48.076
Here, take the cash box!

01:20:49.356 --> 01:20:51.396
- Careful, careful.
- Hurry!

01:21:01.036 --> 01:21:02.236
Jun-gul!

01:21:03.436 --> 01:21:04.676
Min-gul?

01:21:05.116 --> 01:21:07.876
Min-gul, buddy! Over here!

01:21:12.396 --> 01:21:14.116
We're here!

01:21:22.796 --> 01:21:25.276
What is he going over there for?

01:21:34.716 --> 01:21:35.996
You bastard!

01:21:39.436 --> 01:21:41.276
You're all dead.

01:21:50.516 --> 01:21:53.236
Take this, you stupid zombies!

01:21:54.876 --> 01:21:56.676
I'm Park Min-gul of Poongsan,
shitheads!

01:21:56.676 --> 01:21:59.396
This is a gas station, you moron!

01:21:59.476 --> 01:22:01.316
Die! Die! Die!

01:22:01.766 --> 01:22:03.686
The gas tanks will explode!

01:22:03.686 --> 01:22:05.606
I know, just trust me!

01:22:05.606 --> 01:22:07.006
I love you too!

01:22:07.816 --> 01:22:10.216
You'll hit the gas tanks!

01:22:11.816 --> 01:22:13.536
You stupid idiot!

01:22:13.856 --> 01:22:16.416
Just wait
till I get my hands on you!

01:22:30.056 --> 01:22:31.256
Oh god!

01:24:11.056 --> 01:24:13.043
(Sensitive to light and noise)

01:24:38.526 --> 01:24:41.526
So many more arrived here
after you came along.

01:24:41.526 --> 01:24:42.606
It's my fault again?

01:24:42.606 --> 01:24:44.806
I risked my life to come save you.

01:24:45.166 --> 01:24:46.846
I should've just left on my own.

01:24:46.846 --> 01:24:49.806
He's right, it's your fault.

01:24:50.046 --> 01:24:51.433
(Sensitive to light and noise)

01:24:53.486 --> 01:24:54.446
Not even college graduates...

01:24:54.446 --> 01:24:56.406
...Could remember everything
written in there.

01:24:56.406 --> 01:24:57.606
Honey...

01:24:59.686 --> 01:25:01.646
What's wrong? Are you in pain?

01:25:01.646 --> 01:25:02.966
Nam-ju!

01:25:05.206 --> 01:25:06.486
Water broke...

01:25:09.326 --> 01:25:11.326
Is the baby coming? Right now?

01:25:11.326 --> 01:25:13.606
You should've left
the cash box behind!

01:25:13.606 --> 01:25:14.566
You pushed yourself too hard

01:25:14.566 --> 01:25:16.486
because of that thing!

01:25:16.486 --> 01:25:19.046
This is Jackpot's.

01:25:19.246 --> 01:25:21.086
What do we do?

01:25:21.486 --> 01:25:23.726
Do something, buddy!

01:25:24.646 --> 01:25:26.686
Jesus Christ...

01:25:28.366 --> 01:25:30.806
Breathe, keep breathing.

01:25:37.856 --> 01:25:39.296
These are Zzongbie's clothes.

01:25:39.296 --> 01:25:41.376
They rely on sense of smell,

01:25:41.376 --> 01:25:43.176
so they'll think you're him.

01:25:43.456 --> 01:25:44.896
Be careful out there.

01:25:49.816 --> 01:25:51.816
- You want me to go?
- Who else?

01:25:52.986 --> 01:25:55.786
No, I can't do that.

01:25:55.786 --> 01:25:57.906
You know more about these things.

01:25:57.906 --> 01:25:59.986
You go, I'll keep this place safe.

01:25:59.986 --> 01:26:01.986
You're the head of this family.

01:26:01.986 --> 01:26:05.306
Don't play that card,
I'm sick of that shit.

01:26:05.666 --> 01:26:06.826
She's your wife!

01:26:06.826 --> 01:26:07.866
She's your sister-in-law!

01:26:07.866 --> 01:26:09.586
If she was my wife, I'd do it!

01:26:09.586 --> 01:26:10.826
Stop it!

01:26:13.586 --> 01:26:15.426
How do I put this on?

01:26:45.706 --> 01:26:46.546
I can't do this.

01:26:46.546 --> 01:26:48.626
Let's go back, go back!

01:26:54.026 --> 01:26:55.346
Damn it.

01:28:05.346 --> 01:28:06.186
Let's move!

01:28:06.186 --> 01:28:07.226
Give me the key.

01:28:07.226 --> 01:28:08.346
- Give it.
- It's not here?

01:28:08.346 --> 01:28:10.186
That's why I'm asking you!

01:28:10.186 --> 01:28:11.866
Look around, man!

01:28:11.866 --> 01:28:14.146
It's not here, where could it be?

01:28:14.146 --> 01:28:16.346
- Look for it.
- I searched there.

01:28:21.106 --> 01:28:24.226
- Is it there?
- Where did it go?

01:28:26.346 --> 01:28:28.146
Dude, dude...

01:28:31.626 --> 01:28:34.346
Turn the light off.

01:28:37.626 --> 01:28:40.146
- Why did you turn on the lights?
- I didn't turn it on!

01:28:50.346 --> 01:28:51.266
You said you know what to do!

01:28:51.266 --> 01:28:53.186
I didn't expect this!

01:28:57.866 --> 01:28:59.346
They stopped...

01:28:59.346 --> 01:29:01.826
They stopped, they stopped...

01:29:06.786 --> 01:29:08.866
- That stupid girl!
- What's wrong?

01:29:08.866 --> 01:29:09.906
Look!

01:29:09.906 --> 01:29:14.506
I'm sick of this crap,
so move out of the way!

01:29:16.106 --> 01:29:17.986
I said move!

01:29:26.786 --> 01:29:30.506
Get back! Don't!

01:29:30.986 --> 01:29:33.186
- No!
- Hye-gul, no!

01:29:45.626 --> 01:29:47.066
Zzongbie!

01:30:36.226 --> 01:30:39.986
(Poongsan Gas Station)

01:30:45.226 --> 01:30:46.626
Zzongbie!

01:30:47.406 --> 01:30:48.566
Let's go!

01:30:49.006 --> 01:30:50.126
Hurry!

01:30:53.326 --> 01:30:54.606
What's with them?

01:30:55.006 --> 01:30:56.886
What happened?

01:30:57.886 --> 01:30:59.566
Did they go crazy?

01:31:12.726 --> 01:31:13.846
I got it! I know where it is!

01:31:13.846 --> 01:31:15.166
What? Where's what?

01:31:15.166 --> 01:31:18.406
I left the key in my clothes
after I changed!

01:31:18.766 --> 01:31:19.606
Good for you!

01:31:19.606 --> 01:31:21.526
What the hell do we do?

01:31:25.006 --> 01:31:26.206
Go get it.

01:31:26.806 --> 01:31:29.006
You're too much!

01:31:29.326 --> 01:31:31.446
There's no other way.

01:32:06.526 --> 01:32:08.126
Don't come near me!

01:32:10.906 --> 01:32:13.106
What timing.

01:32:15.826 --> 01:32:17.026
Jackpot!

01:32:19.226 --> 01:32:20.506
Jackpot!

01:32:20.986 --> 01:32:23.186
No! Don't you dare!

01:32:24.186 --> 01:32:26.906
Don't touch my Jackpot! Stay back!

01:32:32.986 --> 01:32:34.346
You scum!

01:32:34.346 --> 01:32:35.346
Dude!

01:32:35.346 --> 01:32:37.306
Hey! Park Jun-gul!

01:32:37.946 --> 01:32:39.586
Get the key!

01:32:42.506 --> 01:32:44.386
Go get the truck key!

01:32:45.426 --> 01:32:46.546
Key!

01:32:48.026 --> 01:32:49.466
Jackpot!

01:32:51.426 --> 01:32:53.106
Stay back!

Choon-sam!

01:33:04.506 --> 01:33:05.586
Are you okay?

01:33:09.506 --> 01:33:10.866
Holy hell...

01:33:26.426 --> 01:33:27.626
Key...

01:33:30.306 --> 01:33:32.906
Key... My Jackpot...

01:33:39.906 --> 01:33:41.266
Why are there so many?

01:33:43.386 --> 01:33:44.586
I'll protect you,

01:33:44.586 --> 01:33:46.586
I dare you to come inside.

01:33:57.746 --> 01:33:58.826
Like hell!

01:33:59.986 --> 01:34:01.026
Go away!

01:34:15.756 --> 01:34:17.036
Nam-ju, you okay?

01:34:19.876 --> 01:34:21.276
I'm invincible.

01:34:22.076 --> 01:34:23.116
And you?

01:34:23.316 --> 01:34:24.676
I'm invincible too.

01:34:38.416 --> 01:34:41.576
Not a single step
towards this trailer.

01:34:44.416 --> 01:34:46.536

Min-gul, here's the key!

01:35:48.136 --> 01:35:50.216
Dude! Throw it!

01:35:53.416 --> 01:35:54.536
Nice!

01:36:04.296 --> 01:36:10.016
Take good care of
Jackpot and my wife!

01:36:14.856 --> 01:36:20.416
I wish I could see my son
just once...

01:36:26.776 --> 01:36:28.496
Min-gul, go...

01:36:42.776 --> 01:36:47.016
I've had it with you!
Enough's enough!

01:36:47.056 --> 01:36:49.016
Just stop it!

01:37:11.656 --> 01:37:13.296
Hye-gul, get in!

01:37:16.076 --> 01:37:18.396

What was that?

01:41:04.446 --> 01:41:05.526
What the hell happened?

01:41:05.526 --> 01:41:06.846
Did it explode?

01:41:06.846 --> 01:41:08.246
What do we do?

01:41:56.606 --> 01:42:01.099

What the shit?

01:42:47.096 --> 01:42:49.616
What? What's wrong?

01:42:53.696 --> 01:42:55.096
Honey...

01:42:58.426 --> 01:43:00.286
- Don't go!
- Nam-ju, you can't!

01:43:00.286 --> 01:43:02.286
- Stay away from him!
- No!

01:43:02.286 --> 01:43:04.326
Nam-ju! No!

01:43:30.526 --> 01:43:34.086
Aloha!

01:43:37.166 --> 01:43:38.446
Father?

01:43:39.646 --> 01:43:43.926
What's wrong with the fella?

01:43:44.446 --> 01:43:46.726
This is all your fault!

01:43:46.726 --> 01:43:49.286
Do something!
Bring back my brother!

01:43:49.566 --> 01:43:52.046
What did you just say
to your father?

01:43:52.766 --> 01:43:54.086
Wait a minute...

01:43:55.606 --> 01:43:57.966
Weren't you the first one
to get bitten?

01:44:11.326 --> 01:44:16.166
South Korea is now
in a state of emergency.

01:44:16.886 --> 01:44:20.926
We are under attack
by a deadly virus.

01:44:21.526 --> 01:44:22.646
Stay indoors

01:44:22.646 --> 01:44:26.006
and avoid all contact
with the infected.

01:44:26.646 --> 01:44:29.886
If you've recovered
from the virus,

01:44:29.886 --> 01:44:32.366
head to the Disease Control HQ.

01:44:33.206 --> 01:44:35.406
If you are immune...

01:44:36.526 --> 01:44:38.686

01:44:38.846 --> 01:44:42.366
Father,
you really are okay, right?

01:44:44.526 --> 01:44:46.366
What's with you?

01:44:46.406 --> 01:44:48.486
Do you want me to be sick?

01:44:48.486 --> 01:44:50.646
You rude little prick!

01:44:51.766 --> 01:44:54.126
Father! Dad!

01:44:54.406 --> 01:44:57.206
I love you,
I like you more than anyone!

01:44:57.206 --> 01:44:59.566
