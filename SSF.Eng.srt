00:01:12,838 --> 00:01:14,338
<i>The day I was born,</i>

2
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,380
<i>goats wailed like crazy.</i>

3
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,130
<i>And that day,</i>

4
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:31,505
<i>a demon was born with me.</i>

5
00:01:35,922 --> 00:01:38,963
1999, YEONGWOL, GANGWON-DO

6
00:01:39,297 --> 00:01:41,505
<i>After hiding in my mom's womb</i>
<i>for ten months,</i>

7
00:01:41,588 --> 00:01:43,838
<i>it came into the world</i>
<i>ten minutes before I did.</i>

8
00:01:44,755 --> 00:01:46,922
<i>That thing lived</i>
<i>by eating the flesh of my leg.</i>

9
00:01:47,213 --> 00:01:49,005
<i>Yes, the baby is coming out!</i>

10
00:01:49,088 --> 00:01:50,672
<i>Push! You have to push!</i>

11
00:01:51,672 --> 00:01:52,755
Hold her legs down. Push!

12
00:01:52,838 --> 00:01:54,130
-Try to relax.
-Here it comes!

13
00:01:54,213 --> 00:01:56,713
Here. Take a deep breath. One more time.

14
00:02:01,422 --> 00:02:02,963
-This one is okay.
-The clamp.

15
00:02:03,797 --> 00:02:05,130
-It's just her leg.
-The gauze too.

16
00:02:06,547 --> 00:02:08,838
-Pass me a towel.
-Sure.

17
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,172
Hold the baby. And tie this right here.

18
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,505
Pass it over.

19
00:02:14,172 --> 00:02:15,422
That one...

20
00:02:15,838 --> 00:02:17,297
won't make it.

21
00:02:17,755 --> 00:02:19,255
It won't live long.

22
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,255
<i>People said</i>

23
00:02:23,547 --> 00:02:25,963
<i>it should've been killed back then.</i>

24
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,380
<i>My mom died a week after we were born,</i>

25
00:02:33,297 --> 00:02:36,422
<i>and I was told that my dad died</i>
<i>in a car accident a month after that.</i>

26
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,880
<i>That's what my grandpa told me</i>
<i>when I entered middle school.</i>

27
00:02:44,838 --> 00:02:45,922
<i>And...</i>

28
00:02:46,755 --> 00:02:48,297
<i>the doctor was wrong.</i>

29
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,630
2014, YEONGWOL, GANGWON-DO

30
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:52,797
<i>That thing didn't die that quickly.</i>

31
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,422
<i>It's still alive.</i>

32
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,172
Fuck.

33
00:04:31,005 --> 00:04:32,755
<i>That family moved here recently.</i>

34
00:04:33,255 --> 00:04:34,922
<i>I heard they sell dogs.</i>

35
00:04:35,963 --> 00:04:38,338
<i>I rarely see them though.</i>

36
00:04:38,588 --> 00:04:40,463
Anyway, that family is weird.

37
00:04:41,463 --> 00:04:43,172
When did they move here?

38
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,172
About a month ago, I guess?

39
00:04:49,713 --> 00:04:52,047
And when did your cattle start acting up?

40
00:04:52,588 --> 00:04:54,088
About three weeks ago.

41
00:05:09,713 --> 00:05:11,505
We're almost there.
It's that house over there.

42
00:05:11,588 --> 00:05:13,547
God, those goddamn dogs
bark and howl all day long.

43
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,047
It's so bizarre...

44
00:05:33,713 --> 00:05:36,838
It feels colder here.
The sound of the wind...

45
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:38,213
Aren't I right?

46
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:39,630
Gosh.

47
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,963
They obviously don't want to come out.

48
00:05:42,047 --> 00:05:43,380
This is no joke. This energy is...

49
00:05:43,463 --> 00:05:44,547
Look at this.

50
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,963
There's something unusual.

51
00:05:46,047 --> 00:05:47,338
Let go!

52
00:05:47,422 --> 00:05:49,130
People have told me that...

53
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:55,005
-Something's fishy.
-Otherwise...

54
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:57,088
You know? Why aren't they coming out?

55
00:05:57,172 --> 00:05:59,172
Ma'am, let's come back tomorrow.

56
00:06:00,505 --> 00:06:01,755
<i>We are</i>

57
00:06:02,797 --> 00:06:04,630
<i>living with the demon like this.</i>

58
00:06:07,005 --> 00:06:08,130
<i>Oh, dear Lord.</i>

59
00:06:12,422 --> 00:06:13,713
Please...

60
00:06:13,797 --> 00:06:15,838
Please forgive me for my sins.

61
00:06:16,213 --> 00:06:18,547
I beg you with all my heart and soul.

62
00:06:23,922 --> 00:06:26,505
Please forgive me!

63
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:38,880
Come here for a second.

64
00:06:41,755 --> 00:06:42,838
Why?

65
00:06:43,047 --> 00:06:44,380
Come here.

66
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,797
Have you been doing well in school?

67
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,547
Have you made friends?

68
00:07:03,088 --> 00:07:07,880
This time, we'll try to hold out
so that we won't have to move again.

69
00:07:09,422 --> 00:07:12,297
I bet you hate it so much.

70
00:07:13,088 --> 00:07:14,255
What?

71
00:07:14,338 --> 00:07:15,338
Your leg.

72
00:07:17,755 --> 00:07:19,338
And that thing.

73
00:07:19,755 --> 00:07:21,630
-Your twin sister--
-What about it?

74
00:07:27,338 --> 00:07:29,338
I didn't even register her birth.

75
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,505
I didn't teach her to talk,
but I should've at least--

76
00:07:33,588 --> 00:07:34,713
Forget it. I understand.

77
00:07:34,797 --> 00:07:36,463
Geum-hwa, you see...

78
00:07:36,547 --> 00:07:38,588
I had no idea she'd live this long.

79
00:07:40,672 --> 00:07:42,005
She scares me.

80
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:44,547
I'm still terrified.

81
00:07:45,797 --> 00:07:47,630
Every night,

82
00:07:47,713 --> 00:07:49,213
the sound of her crying...

83
00:07:49,297 --> 00:07:52,005
<i>I am so wondrously saved from sin</i>

84
00:07:52,088 --> 00:07:54,797
<i>Jesus so sweetly abides within</i>

85
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,463
<i>There at the cross where he took me in</i>

86
00:07:57,547 --> 00:08:00,172
-<i>Glory to his name</i>
-You hear that, right?

87
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,297
Yes.

88
00:08:01,755 --> 00:08:03,255
Hymn number 250.

89
00:08:03,338 --> 00:08:04,963
-<i>Glory to his name</i>
-"Down at the Cross."

90
00:08:05,047 --> 00:08:06,213
Shit.

91
00:08:06,297 --> 00:08:08,005
<i>Down where for cleansing from sin I cried</i>

92
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,963
Listen carefully.

93
00:08:19,255 --> 00:08:21,588
That can't be a person crying, right?

94
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,463
Here, this way.

95
00:08:53,463 --> 00:08:55,463
It sounds like a kid crying.

96
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,422
The bush clover branch.

97
00:09:03,838 --> 00:09:05,380
All spirits of the earth and sky.

98
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:10,047
Princess.

99
00:09:16,213 --> 00:09:18,088
I came to say hello.

100
00:09:20,922 --> 00:09:22,880
Princess?

101
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:03,047
<i>Evil is nothing special.</i>

102
00:10:03,213 --> 00:10:05,588
These charlatans you see here are evil.

103
00:10:06,297 --> 00:10:08,297
These fake prophets that you see here

104
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,713
are also known as cults.
It is reported that the total number

105
00:10:10,797 --> 00:10:12,963
of cult-related incidents
per year reaches 1,200,

106
00:10:13,172 --> 00:10:16,088
and the total number of victims
exceeds 50,000.

107
00:10:16,672 --> 00:10:20,297
In this country, where freedom of religion
is rather overly protected,

108
00:10:20,547 --> 00:10:22,755
our research institute
is the only organization

109
00:10:23,005 --> 00:10:25,380
at the vanguard of this spiritual war.

110
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,088
Please show us your support.

111
00:10:28,922 --> 00:10:30,005
Support this good cause.

112
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,172
-Okay.
-Okay.

113
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,088
I'd like to thank Pastor Kim Tae-sik

114
00:10:33,172 --> 00:10:35,463
from Seoul Theological University
for inviting me today.

115
00:10:36,047 --> 00:10:37,880
And lastly, the most important thing.

116
00:10:41,422 --> 00:10:42,463
Faith.

117
00:10:42,547 --> 00:10:43,672
WHERE TO SEND YOUR DONATIONS

118
00:10:43,755 --> 00:10:48,380
Our research institute is in dire need
of your faith and support.

119
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:53,255
Try to imagine how Jesus must've felt
while climbing Golgotha

120
00:10:54,422 --> 00:10:55,547
all alone.

121
00:10:56,755 --> 00:10:59,297
Please support us. Please pray for us.

122
00:11:01,088 --> 00:11:03,005
We'll be the salt and light of the world.

123
00:11:03,088 --> 00:11:04,963
Park Ung-jae is a crook!

124
00:11:05,047 --> 00:11:06,963
-He's a crook!
-He's a crook!

125
00:11:07,047 --> 00:11:08,505
Resign as pastor!

126
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,255
-Resign!
-Resign!

127
00:11:10,338 --> 00:11:12,338
Stop your witch hunt!

128
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,005
-Stop it now!
-Stop it now!

129
00:11:14,088 --> 00:11:15,297
Park Ung-jae must be ousted!

130
00:11:17,838 --> 00:11:19,838
Shut down his research institute!

131
00:11:19,922 --> 00:11:21,713
-Shut it down!
-Shut it down!

132
00:11:21,797 --> 00:11:23,547
Stop the human rights violation!

133
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,838
-Stop it!
-Stop it!

134
00:11:25,338 --> 00:11:28,255
-<i>Brethren, let's raise our hands</i>

<i>-Make a vow to the Lord</i>

136
00:11:30,213 --> 00:11:32,380
Over there! It's Park Ung-jae!

137
00:11:32,463 --> 00:11:33,380
-Where?
-Where is he?

138
00:11:33,463 --> 00:11:34,672
-There!
-Get him!

139
00:11:38,588 --> 00:11:39,422
-Get lost!
-Get lost!

140
00:11:40,922 --> 00:11:43,505
-Get lost!
-Get lost!

141
00:11:44,088 --> 00:11:46,380
Jeez, eggs aren't cheap.
What's wrong with those women?

142
00:11:46,463 --> 00:11:48,380
Why throw food at someone?

143
00:11:48,838 --> 00:11:51,380
-I told you to be careful.
-Gosh!

144
00:11:51,463 --> 00:11:53,922
You shouldn't have messed
with Agape Convent.

145
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:55,463
Jeez, my trench coat...

146
00:11:55,547 --> 00:11:59,338
Pastor, you're becoming
more popular by the day.

147
00:11:59,422 --> 00:12:02,088
That's right. Thank goodness
my dear fans are all ladies this time.

148
00:12:02,172 --> 00:12:04,005
-He bought a new coat again.
-Gosh.

Our heating bill was 500,000 won,
but I can't keep the windows closed.

156
00:12:41,088 --> 00:12:43,547
Who doesn't have
an air purifier these days?

157
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,922
-I've been saying...
-Deaconess Sim,

158
00:12:45,005 --> 00:12:47,338
has the Methodist church paid us?

159
00:12:47,422 --> 00:12:50,213
You'll have to finish the article quickly
for us to get paid.

160
00:12:50,713 --> 00:12:53,672
He never finishes what he starts.
He's all talk.

161
00:12:53,755 --> 00:12:58,297
-Deaconess Sim, I feel suffocated.
-What pastor chain-smokes all day long?

162
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,505
-I can't breathe.
-He's such a slacker.

00:13:00,588 --> 00:13:03,338
-All he does is buy designer clothes.
-I'm off to Gangwon-do.

164
00:13:04,338 --> 00:13:06,380
Are you going there because of Deer Hill?

165
00:13:06,463 --> 00:13:08,755
Of course.
Do you think I'm going on a vacation?

166
00:13:08,838 --> 00:13:10,422
-He's spreading himself too thin.
-Jeez.

167
00:13:10,505 --> 00:13:13,213
Finish the article
on the Moses Adventists first--

168
00:13:13,297 --> 00:13:14,755
Gosh, Deaconess Sim.

169
00:13:14,838 --> 00:13:16,588
Step by step, okay?

170
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:19,588
Even if we expose them now,
the Church can't even sue them.

171
00:13:19,672 --> 00:13:20,838
Then what about Agape Convent?

172
00:13:20,922 --> 00:13:25,172
I've already uploaded that one.
Send it to <i>Catholic Digest</i> tomorrow.

173
00:13:25,922 --> 00:13:27,005
The title should be...

174
00:13:28,838 --> 00:13:30,422
"Mysterious nuns

175
00:13:31,713 --> 00:13:33,338
who can even cure cancer."

176
00:13:35,588 --> 00:13:38,047
End it with a question mark
instead of an exclamation mark.

177
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,672
Jeez, how cheesy.

178
00:13:39,755 --> 00:13:41,922
Come on. It needs the commercial appeal.

179
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,963
Just hurry back and finish
the article and the overdue columns...

180
00:13:45,047 --> 00:13:46,047
Deaconess Sim.

181
00:13:47,297 --> 00:13:49,422
You see, with Buddhist organizations,

182
00:13:49,505 --> 00:13:51,130
the amount of money
jumps to another level.

183
00:13:51,713 --> 00:13:54,380
Let's go on a vacation
to Phuket this winter.

184
00:13:54,463 --> 00:13:55,630
Sounds good? Separately.

185
00:13:55,713 --> 00:13:56,838
Also,

186
00:13:57,713 --> 00:13:58,880
you wanted an air purifier.

187
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,005
-Amen.
-An air purifier!

188
00:14:01,088 --> 00:14:02,588
-Amen.
-We'll buy an air purifier!

189
00:14:02,672 --> 00:14:03,797
Amen!

190
00:14:24,338 --> 00:14:26,213
<i>All right. Attention, everyone.</i>

191
00:14:27,088 --> 00:14:28,963
What flower is this?

192
00:14:29,047 --> 00:14:30,672
-Lotus flower.
-Lotus flower.

193
00:14:31,463 --> 00:14:32,463
Correct.

194
00:14:32,755 --> 00:14:34,922
It's a sacred flower.

195
00:14:35,547 --> 00:14:37,713
Even though it grows
in muddy, murky water,

196
00:14:37,797 --> 00:14:41,297
this beautiful flower always rises out
of the dirty water, completely unstained.

197
00:14:42,005 --> 00:14:43,505
Everyone.

198
00:14:44,963 --> 00:14:47,130
This world is one big muddy mess,

199
00:14:47,713 --> 00:14:51,422
and it's becoming
even more dangerous and cruel.

200
00:14:52,088 --> 00:14:55,880
However, our prayers and sincerity
will change the world.

201
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,130
All right.

202
00:14:58,213 --> 00:15:02,338
Then we'll pray
for the typhoon victims in Jinju

203
00:15:02,422 --> 00:15:04,005
before we wrap up.

204
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,213
-The General protects us.
-The General protects us.

205
00:15:08,547 --> 00:15:09,797
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

206
00:15:10,672 --> 00:15:12,547
All right, thanks. See you tomorrow.

207
00:15:28,463 --> 00:15:30,838
You should eat proper meals. Jeez.

208
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,755
Can you up the expense budget, then?

209
00:15:32,838 --> 00:15:35,338
Spend it first and submit all the receipts
to Deaconess Sim.

210
00:15:35,422 --> 00:15:36,922
You always say that.

211
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:41,338
By the way,
how come there's nothing catchy?

212
00:15:41,422 --> 00:15:43,755
-Is what you sent me really everything?
-Yes, that's it.

213
00:15:44,088 --> 00:15:46,505
What does your gut tell you?

214
00:15:46,588 --> 00:15:48,588
Come on. It's not like you're an amateur.

215
00:15:48,672 --> 00:15:49,922
-Amen.
-Anything?

216
00:15:50,422 --> 00:15:51,547
One odd thing is...

217
00:15:53,005 --> 00:15:54,463
that there's nothing odd.

218
00:15:57,005 --> 00:15:59,797
What about its doctrine?
Does it stem from Donghak?

219
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,797
No.

220
00:16:01,838 --> 00:16:02,922
Dangun?

221
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,088
-Guan Yu?
-No, not at all.

222
00:16:06,463 --> 00:16:08,172
It's actually more classic
than I expected.

223
00:16:08,505 --> 00:16:11,963
It's strongly influenced by Buddhism
and Esoteric Buddhism, but it's pure.

224
00:16:12,047 --> 00:16:13,672
They don't even collect offerings.

225
00:16:13,755 --> 00:16:16,797
They actually give alms to believers
who are struggling financially.

226
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,713
They give alms?

227
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:24,255
You fool, then it's a full network.
It's a pyramid scheme.

228
00:16:24,338 --> 00:16:25,505
No, it's not.

229
00:16:25,588 --> 00:16:27,422
Well, a new cult.
Adultery and money laundering.

230
00:16:27,505 --> 00:16:28,963
So, it's a network. What else?

231
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,672
If I were to tell you something
that's off...

232
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:35,505
Pastor, don't Buddhists
worship Buddha or bodhisattvas?

233
00:16:35,755 --> 00:16:36,838
Yes, that's right.

234
00:16:37,088 --> 00:16:40,505
But these people
worship someone they call "General."

235
00:16:40,838 --> 00:16:41,922
At both chapters.

236
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:46,338
That's not what I'm after.

237
00:16:47,088 --> 00:16:51,130
I need something scandalous.
Something shocking and obscene.

238
00:16:54,297 --> 00:16:57,588
I'll come up with a scenario to present
to the monks at the headquarters.

239
00:16:57,755 --> 00:17:00,755
Mr. Go, let's dig a little deeper.

240
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,338
Bring me something juicy.

241
00:17:06,213 --> 00:17:07,588
Bring it over here.

242
00:17:11,088 --> 00:17:12,422
Did you call forensics?

243
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:15,838
You cannot be here.
Please stand outside the police line.

244
00:17:16,422 --> 00:17:17,588
-You made it, sir.
-Yes.

245
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:21,005
Why didn't you answer my calls?

246
00:17:21,088 --> 00:17:23,463
Hey, what's all this fuss about
at this early hour?

247
00:17:23,547 --> 00:17:24,463
Hey!

248
00:17:24,922 --> 00:17:26,297
I told you guys not to touch it.

249
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:28,838
We have to preserve the scene.

250
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,922
Get out! Captain Hwang is here.

251
00:17:31,005 --> 00:17:32,338
-Damn it.
-Hello, Captain Hwang.

252
00:17:32,963 --> 00:17:35,297
Call Forensics and find out
where they are now.

253
00:17:35,713 --> 00:17:37,838
-Yes, sir.
-A truck crashed into this--

254
00:17:37,922 --> 00:17:39,088
What is this?

255
00:17:39,797 --> 00:17:42,297
It didn't rot at all.
It's completely dried up.

256
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:46,463
This construction job must've been done
pretty recently.

257
00:17:46,547 --> 00:17:48,338
Yes, this won't be a hard case.

258
00:17:48,422 --> 00:17:50,213
I've already contacted
construction companies.

259
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,047
-It's pretty small.
-Pardon me?

260
00:17:54,505 --> 00:17:56,213
The height. It's short.

261
00:17:56,922 --> 00:17:59,172
The victim was
a middle schooler at the most.

262
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,463
While investigating
the Moses Adventists' Gangwon HQ,

263
00:18:05,547 --> 00:18:09,172
I coincidentally discovered
this new religion influenced by Buddhism.

264
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,505
They have two chapters,
in Taebaek and Jeongseon.

265
00:18:11,588 --> 00:18:14,088
At the moment, the total number
of believers is just under 50.

266
00:18:14,172 --> 00:18:16,088
Most of them are teachers, nurses,

267
00:18:16,172 --> 00:18:18,338
-or civil servants--
-Mr. Park.

268
00:18:19,713 --> 00:18:23,005
I bet there are
about 3,000 propagation centers like that.

269
00:18:23,088 --> 00:18:25,880
-I don't see anything problematic with--
-Venerable sir, just a moment.

270
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:29,963
Do you know what alarms me the most?

271
00:18:30,047 --> 00:18:32,505
This organization, Deer Hill,

272
00:18:33,672 --> 00:18:37,255
doesn't make any profit off its believers.

273
00:18:37,338 --> 00:18:38,838
Why does that alarm you?

274
00:18:39,922 --> 00:18:42,213
I'm sure you know the Japanese cult
Aum Shinrikyo.

275
00:18:42,297 --> 00:18:44,338
The culprit of the subway gas attack.

276
00:18:44,422 --> 00:18:46,422
Do you know what they started out as?

277
00:18:47,047 --> 00:18:48,630
A yoga organization.

278
00:18:49,172 --> 00:18:52,213
They sponsored various organizations.

279
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:56,922
Then later on, the leader, Shoko Asahara,
started talking Buddhist doctrines,

280
00:18:57,005 --> 00:18:59,505
saying "I'm Buddha. I'm God."

281
00:18:59,588 --> 00:19:00,797
Then what happened?

282
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:02,922
Isn't it so predictable?

283
00:19:04,005 --> 00:19:05,380
Doomsday.

284
00:19:06,255 --> 00:19:10,505
"Doomsday is near. We shall let
everything go and go to heaven."

285
00:19:13,005 --> 00:19:15,338
That incident killed so many people.

286
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,547
When that happens, it'll be too late.

287
00:19:18,713 --> 00:19:20,755
Control them
by finding their unlawful deeds

288
00:19:20,838 --> 00:19:22,172
and contradicting doctrines,

289
00:19:22,255 --> 00:19:24,088
or people will criticize you
for letting them

290
00:19:24,172 --> 00:19:26,880
dishonor your association
as well as the Buddha--

291
00:19:30,547 --> 00:19:33,672
Pastor Park Ung-jae,
thank you for letting us know.

292
00:19:34,505 --> 00:19:37,005
I think it's a bit of a stretch
to call it a new religion.

293
00:19:37,213 --> 00:19:41,130
It looks like a small organization founded
for socializing or welfare purposes.

294
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,213
You probably don't know this,

295
00:19:43,297 --> 00:19:44,963
but seeking harmonious coexistence
is key--

296
00:19:45,047 --> 00:19:46,380
Venerable sir.

297
00:19:46,588 --> 00:19:49,588
I've been doing this
for over a decade now.

298
00:19:49,672 --> 00:19:52,880
Nowadays, Protestant and Catholic churches
are very concerned

299
00:19:52,963 --> 00:19:54,505
-with purifying--
-Listen.

300
00:19:55,463 --> 00:19:58,505
Such notion of Christian dichotomy
won't help you find the Noble Truths.

301
00:19:58,588 --> 00:19:59,588
Sir.

302
00:20:00,463 --> 00:20:03,380
A propagation center in Chungju
was recently on <i>In Depth 60 Minutes</i>

303
00:20:03,463 --> 00:20:05,922
for selling Buddha statues
and memorial tablets, you know.

304
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:08,963
It wouldn't be a bad idea
to clamp down on them in advance.

305
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:17,297
Why does that octopus head
hate me so much?

306
00:20:17,588 --> 00:20:20,005
Ung-jae,
you totally sounded like a salesman.

307
00:20:20,088 --> 00:20:23,713
Come on. A salesman? Seriously?

308
00:20:23,797 --> 00:20:25,547
That octopus head controls our money.

309
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,838
Try to get on his good side.

310
00:20:26,922 --> 00:20:28,963
It's for a good cause,
so let's take the easy route.

311
00:20:29,047 --> 00:20:30,172
What the hell is this?

312
00:20:30,255 --> 00:20:32,338
Give me information
on that organization, Deer Hill.

313
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,505
What for?

314
00:20:34,588 --> 00:20:36,547
I'll give you an idea.

315
00:20:37,088 --> 00:20:40,255
-What are the three elements of religion?
-Leader, believers, and scriptures.

316
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,922
If it's a newly-risen religion,
they must have their own scriptures.

317
00:20:48,005 --> 00:20:50,755
If they use their own interpretations
or go by a disapproved version--

318
00:20:50,838 --> 00:20:55,088
Only then will your association
have grounds to impose sanctions on them.

319
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:56,297
Bingo.

00:20:58,088 --> 00:20:59,380
Homage to Avalokiteśvara.

321
00:21:07,463 --> 00:21:10,255
-Good work today.
-Thank you.

322
00:21:14,338 --> 00:21:16,547
<i>A body was found</i>

323

324
00:21:18,963 --> 00:21:21,338
<i>and the police are currently</i>
<i>investigating the case.</i>

325
00:21:21,422 --> 00:21:23,547
<i>The body that was found</i>

326
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:26,172
<i>a student of Donggang Girls' Middle School</i>
<i>with the surname, Park.</i>

327
00:21:26,255 --> 00:21:29,755
<i>The police have requested an autopsy</i>

330
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:56,005
Cheol-jin, why are you so late?

331
00:21:56,838 --> 00:21:58,380
You should eat something too.

332
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,797
Come have a seat.

333
00:22:02,463 --> 00:22:04,797
You should've told me
that your friend was coming over.

334
00:22:05,922 --> 00:22:07,880
We don't have many side dishes.

335
00:22:15,505 --> 00:22:18,880
<i>Gwangmok, I knew you'd visit me.</i>

336
00:22:20,463 --> 00:22:22,380
I'm happy I got to see you.

337
00:22:23,213 --> 00:22:24,255
It's been so long.

338
00:22:29,297 --> 00:22:30,880
I'm a failure.

339
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:35,963
I failed to protect Father.
I'm hiding like this because I'm a coward.

340
00:22:36,047 --> 00:22:37,505
No, that's not true. I just think

341
00:22:38,088 --> 00:22:40,047
that your mother's warm home-cooked meal

342
00:22:41,963 --> 00:22:44,047
might have made you weak-willed.

343
00:22:50,088 --> 00:22:51,463
I was afraid.

344
00:22:52,422 --> 00:22:53,672
Every night, they...

345
00:22:54,338 --> 00:22:56,297
The dead kids come at me.

346
00:22:57,172 --> 00:22:59,172
Gwangmok, it's strange. Something...

347
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:01,713
Something's gone wrong.

348
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:02,797
Jiguk.

349
00:23:04,922 --> 00:23:07,255
We're fighting against evil at the moment.

350
00:23:08,172 --> 00:23:09,922
We're carrying out our divine mission.

351
00:23:11,463 --> 00:23:14,422
We mustn't let our fears or regrets
bog us down. You know that.

352
00:23:16,338 --> 00:23:19,672
Jeungjang also reached Nirvana
following Damun, you know?

353
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:21,797
Right.

354
00:23:27,255 --> 00:23:28,547
Go ahead and die.

355
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,755
The world will call you soon.

356
00:23:36,922 --> 00:23:40,463
"You blood-soaked beast, stop crying.

357
00:23:41,213 --> 00:23:43,505
Raise your head and look at the light.

358
00:23:44,963 --> 00:23:46,422
Kneel down."

359

368
00:24:29,047 --> 00:24:30,713
<i>From the corpse from the underpass.</i>

369
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:34,380
<i>I found quite a bit of it</i>
<i>in her mouth and esophagus.</i>

370
00:24:34,838 --> 00:24:38,463
Well, it is edible.
It's nothing too strange, right?

371
00:24:38,547 --> 00:24:39,713
<i>Right, but...</i>

372
00:24:40,297 --> 00:24:43,880
I also found some odd-looking talisman
with the beans.

373
00:24:45,547 --> 00:24:47,130
And I think there was

374
00:24:47,213 --> 00:24:49,422
a similar case from a while ago.

375
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:55,672
We're deers

376
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,797
with pure hearts.

377
00:24:59,422 --> 00:25:00,630
Also,

378
00:25:01,297 --> 00:25:05,255
evil that threatens good
certainly exists in this world.

379
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:09,338
Disciple Seo Ji-yeong lost her mother

380
00:25:09,838 --> 00:25:12,088
in a car accident recently.

381
00:25:13,463 --> 00:25:14,797
In addition,

382
00:25:15,922 --> 00:25:20,297
Disciple Kim Ji-hyeon's husband
was in a big accident.

383
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:24,338
If...

384
00:25:25,297 --> 00:25:27,505
the DUI driver

385
00:25:27,588 --> 00:25:29,672
and the lazy site manager...

386
00:25:30,297 --> 00:25:31,963
Had they never been born,

387
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,755
such tragic accidents
wouldn't have happened.

388
00:25:36,047 --> 00:25:39,963
The light and darkness of this world
are connected.

389
00:25:40,463 --> 00:25:42,713
Because darkness exists,

390
00:25:42,797 --> 00:25:46,922
<i>those who protect the light</i>
<i>can shine even more brightly.</i>

391
00:25:47,338 --> 00:25:49,422
<i>Deer Hill's scriptures</i>

392
00:25:49,505 --> 00:25:51,422

00:25:51,505 --> 00:25:54,297
<i>-in detail.</i>
-Yes, scriptures.

394
00:25:55,297 --> 00:25:56,755
<i>As you all know,</i>

395
00:25:56,838 --> 00:25:59,463
-our scriptures are holy books.
-Gosh, my stomach...

396
00:25:59,547 --> 00:26:01,838
There are only four copies.

397
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,672
"Chae, hidden in
the dazzling river, listen.

398
00:26:09,005 --> 00:26:11,338
You are a beast.

399
00:26:11,422 --> 00:26:13,463
You are a bloodstained beast.

400
00:26:14,422 --> 00:26:18,088
The world will only see your darkness,
so do not be sad..."

401
00:26:18,672 --> 00:26:21,922
Let's see. Scriptures.

402
00:26:23,505 --> 00:26:25,922
<i>At the end of the scripture,</i>

403
00:26:26,005 --> 00:26:28,672
<i>there is a prophecy</i>
<i>that 81 evil enemies with impure energy</i>

404
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:31,297
<i>will be born on this land.</i>

405
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,172
I see, "81 evil enemies."

406
00:26:34,255 --> 00:26:36,338
-Goodness.
-<i>In our scriptures, they're described...</i>

407
00:26:36,422 --> 00:26:37,838
-Now, we know the genre.
-<i>...as snakes.</i>

408
00:26:37,922 --> 00:26:39,880
<i>They're born evil.</i>

409
00:26:40,922 --> 00:26:43,672
<i>The beings that threaten</i>
<i>the good energy in the world...</i>

410
00:26:46,588 --> 00:26:49,338
You should be on standby here.
You two, follow me.

411
00:26:49,422 --> 00:26:51,172
Check everyone who comes out.

412
00:26:51,255 --> 00:26:52,380
Hey, let's go.

413
00:26:59,838 --> 00:27:02,630
Hello, I'm Detective Jo Myeong-hwan
from Yeongwol Police Station.

414
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:05,880
Is there a man named Kim Cheol-jin here?

415
00:27:05,963 --> 00:27:07,255
What is this about?

416
00:27:07,338 --> 00:27:09,672
We're looking for the suspect
of a murder case of a student.

417
00:27:10,172 --> 00:27:11,880
His name is Kim Cheol-jin.

418
00:27:12,463 --> 00:27:14,630
This is his address in the system
at the moment, but...

419
00:27:14,713 --> 00:27:17,088
-What's going on?
-You came to the wrong place.

420
00:27:17,588 --> 00:27:19,380
This is just a Buddhist sanctuary.

421
00:27:19,463 --> 00:27:21,213
It does look like that, but...

422
00:27:22,338 --> 00:27:24,130
ID everyone who's here now

423
00:27:24,213 --> 00:27:25,672
-and take a look inside.
-Yes, sir.

424
00:27:25,755 --> 00:27:28,755
-Excuse us. Please cooperate.
-Actually, just check their IDs.

425
00:27:29,588 --> 00:27:31,172
It looks like a fake address.

426
00:27:31,297 --> 00:27:33,380
You idiot, isn't it obvious?

427
00:27:33,463 --> 00:27:34,755
I figured that out right away.

428
00:27:35,922 --> 00:27:37,130
Damn it.

429
00:27:37,338 --> 00:27:38,505
Shit.

430
00:27:39,047 --> 00:27:40,047
Hey, what's up?

431
00:27:40,463 --> 00:27:41,797
Yes, we're wrapping up here.

432
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,713
God damn it.

433
00:27:49,588 --> 00:27:50,880
Good day, sir.

434
00:27:55,422 --> 00:27:56,505
Do I know you?

435
00:27:57,255 --> 00:27:59,463
Oh, I'm investigating
this propagation center.

436
00:27:59,547 --> 00:28:00,922
I'm Park Ung-jae.

437
00:28:03,172 --> 00:28:05,713
Oh, I've seen you on TV.

438
00:28:06,755 --> 00:28:08,422
You're better-looking in person.

439
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,797
By the way, what brings you here?

440
00:28:11,088 --> 00:28:12,630
-Oh, it's...
-Captain.

441
00:28:12,713 --> 00:28:16,047
We got the address
of Kim Cheol-jin's mother.

442
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,047
-You're sure this time, right?
-Yes.

443
00:28:19,172 --> 00:28:20,172
Let's go!

444
00:28:21,213 --> 00:28:22,672
Have a nice day.

445
00:28:29,297 --> 00:28:30,797
Kim Cheol-jin?

446
00:28:42,713 --> 00:28:43,838
<i>Go ahead and die.</i>

447
00:28:44,838 --> 00:28:46,463
<i>And as for your karma,</i>

448
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,838
<i>I shall take it away.</i>

449
00:29:54,463 --> 00:29:56,172
GEUMGANG UNIVERSITY

450
00:29:56,255 --> 00:29:58,088
<i>About that organization, Deer Hill...</i>

451
00:29:58,172 --> 00:30:00,505
<i>The ones in Taebaek and Jeongseon</i>
<i>aren't their only chapters.</i>

452
00:30:00,588 --> 00:30:02,547
-There's another one?
-Jecheon.

453
00:30:03,547 --> 00:30:05,922
-That deer logo.
<i>-</i>Oh, you're right.

454
00:30:06,005 --> 00:30:08,463
And this is in Danyang.
You see the same logo.

455
00:30:09,213 --> 00:30:11,380
How did you find out
that they have other chapters?

456
00:30:11,463 --> 00:30:12,588
Because...

457
00:30:12,963 --> 00:30:14,713
there should be two more.

458
00:30:16,422 --> 00:30:18,672
Now, let's take a look at what you had.

459
00:30:18,755 --> 00:30:20,755
This portrait of the General in Taebaek.

460
00:30:21,297 --> 00:30:23,380
Also, this altar portrait in Jeongseon.

461
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:24,880
What about them?

462
00:30:24,963 --> 00:30:26,130
They are...

463
00:30:28,338 --> 00:30:29,297
not generals.

464
00:30:31,213 --> 00:30:34,963
They're the Four Great Heavenly Kings,
who symbolize the cardinal directions.

465
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,963
-The Four Heavenly Kings.
-Correct.

466
00:30:38,713 --> 00:30:41,963
In Esoteric Buddhism,
they're called <i>Shitennō.</i>

467
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:45,088
The four guardians
that protect the Buddha.

468
00:30:45,463 --> 00:30:47,297
They're portraits of the two of them.

469
00:31:08,922 --> 00:31:12,255
<i>First, let's look at the painting</i>
<i>at the Deer Hill chapter in Taebaek.</i>

470
00:31:13,047 --> 00:31:15,380
<i>Below him, there are two servants.</i>

471
00:31:15,922 --> 00:31:18,505
<i>On the right, you see Gandharva,</i>
<i>albeit small.</i>

472
00:31:18,963 --> 00:31:21,505
<i>And on the left,</i>
<i>you see Pishacha under him.</i>

473
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:25,380
<i>This blue-faced god holding the pipa.</i>

474
00:31:26,255 --> 00:31:28,963
<i>It's King Jiguk,</i>
<i>the guardian of the eastern direction.</i>

475
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:31,922
And the one in Jeongseon is King Damun.

476
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,797
A Yaksha and a Rakshasa are his followers.

477
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,088
He holds a small pagoda in his left hand
and a spear in his right hand.

478
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:40,505
He is the guardian
of the northern direction.

479
00:31:41,005 --> 00:31:44,547
All right, this map will shed light
on their secret.

480
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,547
King Jiguk in Taebaek, which is east.

481
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,588
King Damun in Jeongseon, which is north.

482
00:31:48,672 --> 00:31:53,047
From there, we can map out
the four cardinal points.

483
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:54,672
That gives us two more locations.

484
00:31:54,755 --> 00:31:57,130
-Jecheon, which is west.
-King Gwangmok.

485
00:31:57,213 --> 00:31:59,422
-Danyang, which is south.
-King Jeungjang.

486
00:31:59,505 --> 00:32:02,672
Look at you. My alumnus, Lee Jeong-beom,
from Whimoon High School.

487
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:05,047
All the temple food
sure has sharpened your insight.

488
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:07,380
I eat at the cafeteria these days.

489
00:32:07,838 --> 00:32:09,880
-Ung-jae, by the way...
-Good. This is great.

490
00:32:09,963 --> 00:32:11,963
A new religious group
that worships such deities.

491
00:32:12,713 --> 00:32:14,213
Have you seen it before?

492
00:32:14,297 --> 00:32:16,880
No, I've never seen
anything like this before.

493
00:32:25,172 --> 00:32:26,838
<i>The Four Heavenly Kings</i>

494
00:32:27,422 --> 00:32:30,213
<i>were originally evil spirits in India.</i>

495
00:32:30,797 --> 00:32:33,338
<i>However, they meet the Buddha</i>
<i>and become devoted to his teachings.</i>

496
00:32:33,713 --> 00:32:37,505
<i>Hence, they become gods that protect</i>
<i>the world from evil, malicious spirits.</i>

497
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:40,963
Evil gods that fight evil spirits...

498
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,838
Shit, jeez.

499
00:32:43,922 --> 00:32:46,630
Scriptures, where are you?

500
00:33:02,838 --> 00:33:03,922
Yo-sep!

501
00:33:14,422 --> 00:33:15,505
Pastor, go on in.

502
00:33:15,922 --> 00:33:17,547
You should go in.

503
00:33:20,422 --> 00:33:23,088
-Jeez, go on in.
-Shit.

504
00:33:30,588 --> 00:33:32,130
Someone must live in this room.

505
00:33:32,213 --> 00:33:33,547
Kim Cheol-jin.

506
00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:36,005
Pastor!

507
00:33:38,172 --> 00:33:40,797
Scriptures about King Jiguk...

508
00:34:43,005 --> 00:34:45,213
<i>The suspect is here. He's going up.</i>

509
00:34:45,922 --> 00:34:47,380
Wait for your cue.

510
00:35:20,172 --> 00:35:24,047
<i>Mom, listen carefully</i>
<i>to what I'm about to say.</i>

511
00:35:25,088 --> 00:35:28,588
<i>Regardless of what people say,</i>
<i>what you see isn't everything.</i>

512
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,505
<i>Your son</i>

513
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:32,422
<i>fought against evil</i>

514
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,838
<i>for this world.</i>

515
00:35:35,713 --> 00:35:37,880
<i>I'm sure God will appreciate</i>
<i>all the hard work I've done.</i>

516
00:35:39,672 --> 00:35:42,672
<i>I was blessed as your son.</i>

517
00:35:44,422 --> 00:35:47,088
<i>Mom, when we meet again in heaven,</i>

518
00:35:48,297 --> 00:35:49,588
-<i>I will...</i>
-He's on the rooftop!

519
00:35:49,672 --> 00:35:50,963
-Fuck!
-Quickly!

520
00:35:52,047 --> 00:35:53,338
-He's on the rooftop!
-Hey, go!

521
00:35:54,672 --> 00:35:56,172
<i>I will give you a big hug.</i>

522
00:35:59,713 --> 00:36:01,005
Hey, hurry!

523
00:36:01,713 --> 00:36:03,838
Under the merciful smile of the Buddha...

524
00:36:03,922 --> 00:36:04,922
Found him!

525
00:36:05,005 --> 00:36:07,797
The beast finally wins the war
against the snakes.

526
00:36:08,797 --> 00:36:11,922
The skies will never forget
your hard work.

527
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:14,463
-Hey, Kim Cheol-jin!
-Behold.

528
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:17,172
-You bastard!
-Now, with the wings that he has earned,

529
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:20,588
-the beast will be
-The beast will be

530
00:36:21,172 --> 00:36:22,505
-born again.
-born again.

531
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,672
-Hey, don't!
-Get down! Damn it!

532
00:36:25,672 --> 00:36:27,255
-No!
-Kim Cheol-jin!

533
00:36:34,547 --> 00:36:35,672
The suspect jumped.

534
00:37:01,588 --> 00:37:05,380
SEOUL NAMDAEMUN POLICE STATION

535
00:37:09,172 --> 00:37:13,922
MURDER SUSPECT HANGS HIMSELF
AND JUMPS TO DEATH

536
00:37:14,463 --> 00:37:16,672
Hey, here's information on Kim Cheol-jin.

537
00:37:16,922 --> 00:37:19,130
Thanks, sister.

538
00:37:19,213 --> 00:37:22,130
Whatever, you smooth talker.
Don't ask me for such favors from now on.

539
00:37:22,213 --> 00:37:23,255
You think I'm a pushover?

540
00:37:23,338 --> 00:37:26,130
Come on. I helped you
with the Sion Group case a while back.

541
00:37:26,213 --> 00:37:27,255
Have you forgotten?

542
00:37:27,338 --> 00:37:29,547
I help you too.
We have to help each other out.

543
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:32,088
Hey, it's the holiday season.
Christmas is coming up.

544
00:37:32,172 --> 00:37:33,797
Do you know how sensitive everyone is now?

545
00:37:36,088 --> 00:37:37,213
Hello?

546
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:38,672
Yes.

547
00:37:39,088 --> 00:37:40,380
I'm outside.

548
00:37:40,463 --> 00:37:42,380
I'll be back very soon, okay?

549
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,255
Yangju Juvenile Detention Center?

550
00:37:45,505 --> 00:37:48,297
Kim Cheol-jin committed a murder
when he was a minor.

551
00:37:51,047 --> 00:37:55,505
GANGWON PROVINCIAL OFFICE OF EDUCATION

552
00:37:55,588 --> 00:37:57,630
-Hello.
-Hello.

553
00:38:12,422 --> 00:38:14,380
Jiguk had asked me to get this.

554
00:38:14,713 --> 00:38:17,797
I looked into it, and it seems like
the family has moved around quite a bit.

555
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:21,047
The records from this school
are probably the most recent records.

556
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:22,672
Thank you, Bodhisattva.

557
00:38:23,672 --> 00:38:24,838
Gwangmok.

558
00:38:26,297 --> 00:38:28,797
I'm honored to finally meet you in person.

HAVE YOU BEEN TO SEOUL?

569
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:20,588
YES, EVERLAND

570
00:40:20,672 --> 00:40:21,838
YOU MORON, THAT'S NOT SEOUL

571
00:40:21,922 --> 00:40:23,755
I'M ACTUALLY A MORON

00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,213
SEND ME A PHOTO

573
00:40:45,463 --> 00:40:46,672
Why did you lock your door?

574
00:40:48,463 --> 00:40:49,588
Because I'm scared.

575
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:52,297
Did you feed her?

576
00:40:54,172 --> 00:40:55,338
Did you give her food?

577
00:40:55,588 --> 00:40:57,297
-No.
-Take some food to her now.

578
00:42:27,172 --> 00:42:30,338
<i>The King Jiguk scripture</i>
<i>you brought from Taebaek</i>

579
00:42:31,088 --> 00:42:32,838
is basically early Buddhist literature

580
00:42:32,922 --> 00:42:36,047
mixed with <i>The Samdhinirmocana Sutra</i>
and <i>The Diamond Sutra.</i>

581
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:37,463
But the important thing is,

582
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,963
there's a sutra I've never seen before.

583
00:42:40,463 --> 00:42:42,463
It's the part at the very end.

584
00:42:42,547 --> 00:42:44,880
It's called <i>Hangmagyeong.</i>

585
00:42:45,588 --> 00:42:47,338
<i>-"Hangma."</i>
-That's right.

586
00:42:47,422 --> 00:42:50,463
As you can guess, it's about gods
fighting against evil enemies.

587
00:42:50,547 --> 00:42:52,255
It's like <i>The Book of Revelation.</i>

588
00:42:52,338 --> 00:42:53,380
Listen to this.

589
00:42:53,713 --> 00:42:56,922
Other parts of the scripture
are written in an overly practical manner,

590
00:42:57,047 --> 00:43:00,297
but <i>Hangmagyeong</i> is very symbolic.

591
00:43:02,005 --> 00:43:04,005
Like the <i>Revelation to John</i>
from the Bible.

592
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,922
-What could it be?
-Have you heard of <i>"hangma"</i> before?

593
00:43:08,047 --> 00:43:09,005
No, never.

594
00:43:09,088 --> 00:43:10,922
Shouldn't you know about it
after all this time?

595
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,047
You should call it a day.

596
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:16,630
Are you wearing makeup?

597
00:43:23,588 --> 00:43:24,630
Deaconess Sim, he is...

598
00:43:25,213 --> 00:43:27,047
He's a monk.

599
00:43:27,547 --> 00:43:29,463
No, they're perfect for each other.

600
00:43:32,922 --> 00:43:36,713
"The sad beasts lying face down
will be born again with wings

601
00:43:36,797 --> 00:43:40,172
and trample all over the snakes
on the fundament.

602
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:47,088
Beasts, who protect the light.
Stars, who will trample over the snakes.

603
00:43:47,172 --> 00:43:50,088
<i>Wipe your tears.</i>
<i>Do not hide your trembling body.</i>

604
00:43:50,172 --> 00:43:53,047
<i>Catch the snake</i>
<i>nestling in the girl's body.</i>

605
00:43:53,463 --> 00:43:58,172
<i>Those snakes will have beautiful eyes</i>
<i>and sweet tongues.</i>

606
00:43:58,505 --> 00:44:02,213
<i>Brave beasts, do not look at their eyes.</i>

607
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,755
<i>Do not listen to their words.</i>

608
00:44:05,172 --> 00:44:09,672
<i>Only the snakes' blood will purify you."</i>

609
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:35,547
<i>Mister.</i>

610
00:44:40,588 --> 00:44:42,630
<i>Mister.</i>

611
00:45:26,422 --> 00:45:27,505
<i>Na-han.</i>

612
00:45:28,838 --> 00:45:31,797
Na-han, you need to wake up.

613
00:45:37,172 --> 00:45:39,547
<i>"Under the merciful smile of the Buddha,</i>

614
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:43,005
<i>four beasts will win the war</i>
<i>against the snakes</i>

615
00:45:43,088 --> 00:45:44,630
<i>and shall be born again.</i>

616
00:45:45,213 --> 00:45:49,463
<i>The Buddha's bright light</i>
<i>will protect you."</i>

617
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,880
So we were right.

618
00:45:52,297 --> 00:45:53,880
They do worship the Four Heavenly Kings.

619
00:45:53,963 --> 00:45:54,963
That's right.

620
00:45:55,047 --> 00:45:57,005
Have a look at this.

621
00:45:57,547 --> 00:45:59,172
It was originally a beast.

622
00:45:59,338 --> 00:46:01,672
But it meets the Buddha
and starts following his teachings.

623
00:46:01,755 --> 00:46:03,755
-And here--
-Then it becomes a god that fights evil,

624
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:06,755
ascends to heaven
and eventually becomes the Buddha.

625
00:46:08,797 --> 00:46:10,172
These folks...

626
00:46:12,047 --> 00:46:14,005
They're after ghosts.

627
00:46:16,005 --> 00:46:18,838
Haean, can you find out
who wrote this scripture?

628
00:46:18,922 --> 00:46:20,963
There's a Buddhist name
written on the last page.

629
00:46:21,047 --> 00:46:22,380
Kim Pungsa.

630
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:24,297
Kim Pungsa?

631
00:46:25,713 --> 00:46:27,213
Kim Pungsa...

632
00:46:27,838 --> 00:46:29,755
Ask Dr. Goo.

633
00:46:29,838 --> 00:46:31,963
Dr. Goo? Who's Dr. Goo?

634
00:46:32,547 --> 00:46:33,588
Google.

635
00:46:40,505 --> 00:46:43,213
Deaconess Sim, are you trying to charm us
with your sense of humor?

636
00:46:44,588 --> 00:46:45,547
My goodness.

637
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:48,213
I should give you a raise! My gosh.

638
00:46:54,672 --> 00:46:56,380
Buddhism, religion.

639
00:46:56,463 --> 00:46:59,130
Nice, look at that.
This is so much better.

640
00:46:59,297 --> 00:47:01,713
"Tibetan Buddhist Master, Nechung Tenpa,

641
00:47:01,797 --> 00:47:04,130
wishes to meet the founder of Dongbanggyo,
Kim Je-seok."

642
00:47:04,547 --> 00:47:06,005
"Dongbanggyo"?

643
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:09,505
It's that man, Kim Je-seok.

644
00:47:09,588 --> 00:47:11,797
Yes, he was very famous
in the Buddhist community.

645
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,672
He still has many followers.

646
00:47:13,755 --> 00:47:17,588
The founder of Dongbanggyo, Kim Je-seok,
wrote this scripture?

647
00:47:17,672 --> 00:47:21,338
I know someone
who's an expert on Dongbanggyo.

648
00:47:22,338 --> 00:47:23,172
Who?

649
00:47:24,255 --> 00:47:25,172
The octopus.

650
00:47:28,588 --> 00:47:30,963
<i>Monk Octopus is quite materialistic.</i>

651
00:47:31,213 --> 00:47:34,380
<i>I'll call him and give him a heads-up.</i>
<i>Make sure you buy something good.</i>

652
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,255
God, that octopus...

653
00:47:37,755 --> 00:47:41,630
Why does he live in the mountains,
not in the ocean?

654
00:47:49,922 --> 00:47:51,297
I see cars up here.

655
00:48:07,297 --> 00:48:09,255
Thank you for such a valuable gift.

656
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,213
How thoughtful.

657
00:48:11,838 --> 00:48:15,380
I know that monks like to keep
their material possessions to a minimum.

658
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:17,172
-Just as a sincere gesture...
-Thank you.

659
00:48:18,422 --> 00:48:21,880
A sincere gesture
that's worth 6,000 won, right?

660
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,797
I spoke to Monk Haean briefly
on the phone.

661
00:48:26,547 --> 00:48:29,380
-I see.
-Kim Je-seok of Dongbanggyo...

662
00:48:29,463 --> 00:48:30,672
DONGBANGGYO

663
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,505
The first thing I'd like to say is...

664
00:48:38,713 --> 00:48:40,213
Pungsa Kim Je-seok

665
00:48:41,797 --> 00:48:42,713
is real.

666
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:46,672
What do you mean?

667
00:48:46,755 --> 00:48:47,588
In short,

668
00:48:48,297 --> 00:48:49,797
he's become a god.

669
00:48:50,755 --> 00:48:54,588
Conservative Buddhist organizations
disapproved of him back then,

670
00:48:54,922 --> 00:48:58,588
but Kim Je-seok has attained Buddhahood.

671
00:49:00,172 --> 00:49:02,547
Here's a photo of him.

672
00:49:03,588 --> 00:49:06,380
It was taken around 1940.

673
00:49:06,588 --> 00:49:10,005
Because he was incredibly enlightened,
Esoteric Buddhist monks from Japan

674
00:49:10,088 --> 00:49:13,838
and even the governor-general
called him Master.

675
00:49:13,922 --> 00:49:15,297
So, he was pro-Japanese?

676
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:16,713
I'm not done yet.

677
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,005
Oh, my apologies.

678
00:49:19,088 --> 00:49:22,797
He actually sent money to the Heroic Corps
to help them raise the independence fund.

679
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,380
Even after gaining independence,

680
00:49:24,463 --> 00:49:28,255
he retrieved the assets and treasures
that Japan had stolen from us.

681
00:49:28,338 --> 00:49:29,588
However,

682
00:49:30,047 --> 00:49:33,047
when the political turbulence
began escalating,

683
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:36,588
he started spending everything
for the religious community and welfare.

684
00:49:36,672 --> 00:49:39,588
And naturally,
he was able to expand his influence.

685
00:49:39,672 --> 00:49:41,755
So, that's Dongbanggyo.

686
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:42,838
Bingo.

687
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:47,297
Then in 1985,

688
00:49:47,713 --> 00:49:51,922
Kim Je-seok suddenly disbanded Dongbanggyo
and disappeared.

689
00:49:52,505 --> 00:49:53,880
Why did he do that?

690
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:56,255
I heard he was planning
to write new scriptures.

691
00:50:01,713 --> 00:50:03,880
-Have you met him in person?
-No.

692
00:50:03,963 --> 00:50:07,005
Only few people got to meet him in person.

693
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:10,838
I heard only his closest disciples
were allowed to meet with him.

694
00:50:11,505 --> 00:50:13,088
Would he be alive now?

695
00:50:13,172 --> 00:50:14,463
I'm not sure.

696
00:50:14,547 --> 00:50:17,297
Kim Je-seok is from Yeongwol, Gangwon-do.

697
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:20,380
He was born in 1899, so he should be...

698
00:50:20,463 --> 00:50:22,630
He should be 116 years old.

699
00:50:22,713 --> 00:50:24,422
Then he probably passed away.

700
00:50:25,755 --> 00:50:26,588
Unfortunately.

701
00:50:26,672 --> 00:50:27,922
Pastor, here.

702
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:30,797
Yes, I saw it.

703
00:50:32,255 --> 00:50:34,172
DONGBANGGYO FOUNDER, KIM JE-SEOK,

704
00:50:34,255 --> 00:50:36,588
DONATES TO YANGJU
JUVENILE DETENTION CENTER

705
00:50:41,005 --> 00:50:42,838
<i>Right, sir.</i>

706
00:50:43,338 --> 00:50:46,422
It's getting cold,
and Christmas is just around the corner,

707
00:50:46,505 --> 00:50:49,505
so I suddenly thought of the boys
at the detention center.

708
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:52,463
Okay, I'll see you soon.

709
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:03,547
You don't think he's still alive, right?

710
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:06,922
He should be dead now, if he was fake.

711
00:51:10,047 --> 00:51:12,005
-But you know what, Yo-sep?
-Yes?

712
00:51:12,088 --> 00:51:13,755
Aren't you curious?

713
00:51:14,422 --> 00:51:15,255
About what?

714
00:51:16,422 --> 00:51:18,380
What if, somewhere in the world,

715
00:51:20,213 --> 00:51:21,838
the real one really exists...

716
00:51:21,922 --> 00:51:24,463
Pastor, what are you talking about?
God is alive.

717
00:51:25,672 --> 00:51:27,213
God is alive?

718
00:51:34,672 --> 00:51:35,963
A friend of mine

719
00:51:36,797 --> 00:51:38,505
graduated from the seminary, got married,

720
00:51:38,588 --> 00:51:40,755
and moved to South Africa
for missionary work.

721
00:51:42,213 --> 00:51:43,963
He always prayed diligently.

722
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:47,422
They were a couple with a strong faith.

723
00:51:48,463 --> 00:51:51,422
But a few years later,
he moved back all by himself.

724
00:51:52,047 --> 00:51:53,338
Why?

725
00:51:55,172 --> 00:51:57,255
His entire family, except him,
was shot to death.

726
00:52:00,588 --> 00:52:02,130
Including his two-year-old son

727
00:52:02,672 --> 00:52:04,088
and his newborn...

728
00:52:08,213 --> 00:52:11,005
His newborn daughter as well.
They all died.

729
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:18,255
Do you know what the culprit,
a 13-year-old Muslim boy, said?

730
00:52:23,713 --> 00:52:25,047
He said it was God's will.

731
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:31,505
You see, I still feel so clueless.

732
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:38,713
We're struggling and scuffling
at rock bottom like ants.

733
00:52:39,588 --> 00:52:42,755
Where is our God? And what is he doing?

734
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:48,922
So, I'd like to meet that man at least.

735
00:52:50,297 --> 00:52:51,755
People say that he's become a god.

736
00:52:54,255 --> 00:52:58,797
UPHOLD THE LAW WITH FAITH
AND REFORM WITH FAITH

737
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,422
It's noisy here. Let's go inside.

738
00:53:00,505 --> 00:53:01,463
Sure.

739
00:53:04,672 --> 00:53:07,255
-A religion research institute?
-Yes.

740
00:53:07,838 --> 00:53:10,922
What inspired you to bring gifts
for our boys?

741
00:53:12,213 --> 00:53:14,547
I just wanted to meet the boys

742
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:17,297
and show my gratitude
for all your hard work and service.

743
00:53:17,588 --> 00:53:19,547
That's not the impression I'm getting.

744
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:24,338
-Pastor.
-Yes.

745
00:53:24,422 --> 00:53:26,380
I've been working here for 30 years.

746
00:53:27,005 --> 00:53:29,088
No one donates or helps without an agenda.

747
00:53:29,213 --> 00:53:32,005
Do whatever it is you came here to do
and leave. It's okay.

748
00:53:32,088 --> 00:53:35,755
Gosh, you're very straightforward.

749
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:37,672
Years ago, Dong...

750
00:53:37,755 --> 00:53:39,588
-Dongbanggyo.
-Right, Dongbanggyo.

751
00:53:39,672 --> 00:53:41,672
I heard they donated
to this detention center.

752
00:53:41,755 --> 00:53:44,130
Oh, that was about 20 years ago.

753
00:53:44,213 --> 00:53:48,463
Right, we built this training facility,
Jeseok Hall, with their donation.

754
00:53:48,547 --> 00:53:51,755
I see. Then the name, Jeseok Hall,
must be from

755
00:53:51,838 --> 00:53:53,963
the name of Dongbanggyo's founder,
Pungsa Kim Je-seok.

756
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:55,422
Right, yes.

757
00:53:55,922 --> 00:53:57,047
At one point,

758
00:53:57,713 --> 00:54:02,088
the religious community targeted him,
but he was such a wonderful person.

759
00:54:02,422 --> 00:54:05,797
He thought of our boys as his own sons.

760
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,880
I see. Why do you think he did that?

761
00:54:08,672 --> 00:54:09,547
Pardon me?

762
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:12,338
You said no one donates or helps
without an agenda.

763
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:20,005
Master Kim did everything in his power

764
00:54:20,088 --> 00:54:23,297
to support and care for
these four inmates in this photo.

765
00:54:24,422 --> 00:54:26,297
Four inmates?

766
00:54:27,088 --> 00:54:29,463
Four inmates that killed
their own fathers.

767
00:54:31,005 --> 00:54:32,838
Educating them had its limits.

768
00:54:32,922 --> 00:54:34,838
Hence, through the power of religion...

769
00:54:34,922 --> 00:54:39,047
Master Kim went beyond that.
He even adopted them.

770
00:54:40,713 --> 00:54:42,172
All four of them?

771
00:54:43,505 --> 00:54:45,838
And one of them was Kim Cheol-jin, right?

772
00:54:45,922 --> 00:54:48,838
Yes. What a beautiful story, right?

773
00:54:49,463 --> 00:54:51,838
He wanted to be a father
who they could look up to.

774
00:54:52,088 --> 00:54:53,297
Then,

775
00:54:54,172 --> 00:54:56,380
the rest of them, these three boys.

776
00:54:57,422 --> 00:54:59,130
Could you tell me who they are?

777
00:55:53,172 --> 00:55:55,672
Jeong Na-han, Kim Cheol-jin,
Chae Tae-geun, and Jeon Sang-beom.

778
00:55:55,755 --> 00:55:58,338
All four of them are mentioned
in the scripture.

779
00:55:58,963 --> 00:56:01,380
"Chae, hidden
in the dazzling river, listen.

780
00:56:01,463 --> 00:56:03,463
You are a beast.
You are a bloodstained beast.

781
00:56:03,547 --> 00:56:07,255
The world will only see your darkness,
so do not be sad."

782
00:56:08,005 --> 00:56:09,922
It totally checks out.

783
00:56:10,005 --> 00:56:13,172
"Dazzling river." It's "Gwangju"
based on the Chinese characters.

784
00:56:13,255 --> 00:56:16,130
Chae. This is referring to Chae Tae-geun,
who was born in Gwangju.

785
00:56:16,213 --> 00:56:18,755
And "Jeong" in "the river of stars."

786
00:56:18,838 --> 00:56:21,422
Seongju. The Seongju Jeong clan,
Jeong Na-han.

787
00:56:21,505 --> 00:56:22,838
"Blue river."

788
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:25,713
The Cheongju Kim clan, Kim Cheol-jin.

789
00:56:25,797 --> 00:56:27,880
"The river of thunder." Jinju.

790
00:56:27,963 --> 00:56:29,588
"Jeon, the hidden beast"?

791
00:56:29,672 --> 00:56:31,797
The Jinju Jeon clan, Jeon Sang-beom.

792
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:34,463
This scripture
accurately predicted everything.

793
00:56:34,547 --> 00:56:36,963
The four boys from prison.

794
00:56:37,213 --> 00:56:40,088
And three of them died.

795
00:56:40,172 --> 00:56:41,172
What?

796
00:56:42,172 --> 00:56:44,672
Three of them died? What do you mean?

797
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:47,505
Here, look.

798
00:56:48,338 --> 00:56:51,213
Look at the Heavenly King portraits
in Jeongseon and Danyang.

799
00:56:51,297 --> 00:56:52,963
You see halos above their heads, right?

800
00:56:53,047 --> 00:56:54,297
Halos.

801
00:56:54,713 --> 00:56:58,380
Catholic martyrs are also depicted
with halos above their heads.

802
00:56:58,463 --> 00:56:59,630
I was curious as well.

803
00:56:59,713 --> 00:57:03,713
Why do you think only the ones
in Jeongseon and Danyang have halos?

804
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:06,505
It means they're dead.

805
00:57:07,963 --> 00:57:09,380
They attained Nirvana.

806
00:57:09,922 --> 00:57:12,130
Gracefully, while catching ghosts.

807
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:14,797
Gosh, no way.

808
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:18,547
All right. Now that Kim Cheol-jin
is also dead,

809
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:22,880
King Jiguk in Taebaek
needs a halo above his head as well.

810
00:57:22,963 --> 00:57:24,130
Then that means...

811
00:57:24,755 --> 00:57:26,588
this guy is the only one that's left.

812
00:57:29,672 --> 00:57:31,630
King Gwangmok in Jecheon.

813
00:57:31,713 --> 00:57:35,630
JECHEON, GWANGMOK

814
01:01:19,047 --> 01:01:22,463
SEOUL NAMDAEMUN POLICE STATION

815
01:01:23,213 --> 01:01:25,922
So, three out of the four guys
actually died.

816
01:01:26,547 --> 01:01:28,922
First off, as for Jeon Sang-beom...

817
01:01:29,005 --> 01:01:31,255
He died in the Yeongwol
Maria Postnatal Care Center fire?

818
01:01:31,338 --> 01:01:35,630
Gosh, many mothers and babies
died in this fire.

819
01:01:36,088 --> 01:01:38,213
And it says here
that Chae Tae-geun died in Canada.

820
01:01:38,297 --> 01:01:41,880
He was convicted of robbery and murder.

821
01:01:42,963 --> 01:01:47,380
He killed a Korean-Canadian family
on the spur of the moment

822
01:01:47,547 --> 01:01:49,130
and got caught while on the run.

823
01:01:49,755 --> 01:01:52,380
He hanged himself
at a detention center in Toronto.

824
01:01:53,047 --> 01:01:55,380
Jeez, this invalidates
the correlation I thought they had.

825
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:59,547
How about the last one
who's still alive, Jeong Na-han?

826
01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:00,755
PERSONAL RECORDS
JEONG NA-HAN

827
01:02:00,838 --> 01:02:02,797
Born in 1983. Name, Jeong Na-han.

828
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:04,547
I vaguely remember him.

829
01:02:05,255 --> 01:02:07,547
A middle school boy, who grew up

830
01:02:07,630 --> 01:02:09,713
in a red-light district,
beat his father to death.

831
01:02:10,422 --> 01:02:13,213
His mother must've worked
in the red-light district.

832
01:02:13,297 --> 01:02:16,547
And I bet his father was human trash,
a pimp or something like that.

833
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:17,797
It's obvious, you know.

834
01:02:18,588 --> 01:02:20,630
There were a lot of disagreements
as to how

835
01:02:20,713 --> 01:02:22,713
this middle schooler
should be punished or treated.

836
01:02:22,922 --> 01:02:24,797
I remember there were many controversies.

837
01:02:25,630 --> 01:02:26,880
In a way,

838
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:28,713
I feel bad for him.

839
01:02:29,713 --> 01:02:31,088
He doesn't deserve your pity.

840
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:25,380
<i>My baby, my white ram lamb</i>

841
01:03:26,255 --> 01:03:30,672
<i>Fall asleep in Mama's arms</i>

842
01:03:30,755 --> 01:03:32,297
<i>The cold winter</i>

843
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:36,963
<i>The cold winter storm</i>

844
01:03:37,838 --> 01:03:42,297
<i>-Stay far away from our house</i>
<i>-Stay far away from our house</i>

845

<i>-Dark nights, go away</i>

<i>-Stay far away from our house</i>

<i>Hushaby, my baby</i>

848
01:04:01,088 --> 01:04:06,130
<i>Don't cry, hushaby</i>

849
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:16,130
<i>Stay far away from our house</i>

850
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:50,088
King Gwangmok.

851
01:04:51,588 --> 01:04:53,338
He's better-looking in person.

852
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:27,505
NOKYAWON

853
01:06:05,838 --> 01:06:07,713
Gwangmok is here.

854
01:06:12,713 --> 01:06:13,922
Hello.

855
01:06:25,797 --> 01:06:27,713
They say that deers are immortal.

856
01:06:29,213 --> 01:06:30,797
Why are they so weak though?

857
01:06:33,838 --> 01:06:35,588
Death is not the end, you know.

858
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:39,255
It'll be reincarnated as a human being.

859
01:06:41,297 --> 01:06:42,630
Right.

860
01:06:44,422 --> 01:06:46,172
But why is it that all creatures

861
01:06:47,463 --> 01:06:49,255
have such sad eyes when they die?

862
01:06:50,672 --> 01:06:52,130
<i>I saw it with my own eyes.</i>

863
01:06:53,297 --> 01:06:54,588
<i>It can't be a human being.</i>

864
01:06:55,088 --> 01:06:56,338
Gwangmok.

865
01:06:56,505 --> 01:06:58,505
The beings that we're after
don't look like that.

866
01:06:58,588 --> 01:07:00,505
I know that better than anyone else does.

867
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:03,838
"Those snakes will have beautiful eyes

868
01:07:04,047 --> 01:07:05,922
and sweet tongues.

869
01:07:06,713 --> 01:07:09,380
Catch the snake
nestling in the girl's body."

870
01:07:11,588 --> 01:07:14,505
The Demon also appeared before the Buddha
looking beautiful.

871
01:07:16,463 --> 01:07:18,005
Do not let it fool you.

872
01:07:19,047 --> 01:07:20,713
<i>That girl is the snake.</i>

873
01:07:41,672 --> 01:07:42,880
Master.

874
01:07:43,963 --> 01:07:45,463
Gwangmok is here.

875
01:07:48,505 --> 01:07:51,838
He's deteriorating by the day.
We don't have time.

876
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,088
"Beast, listen.

877
01:07:56,838 --> 01:07:58,630
The day the snake sheds its first blood,

878
01:08:00,463 --> 01:08:01,588
the light will go off,

879
01:08:02,047 --> 01:08:03,505
and darkness will befall this world."

880
01:08:05,838 --> 01:08:07,213
You must hurry.

881
01:08:07,672 --> 01:08:09,380
You're the only one that's left now.

882
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:15,130
Listen, Jeong in the river of stars.

883
01:08:16,088 --> 01:08:17,505
You are Gwangmok.

884
01:08:18,005 --> 01:08:20,005
From now on, your name will be Gwangmok.

885
01:08:20,838 --> 01:08:23,755
"Gwang" means "wide,"
and "mok" means "to see."

886
01:08:23,838 --> 01:08:28,588
You are a brave general
who destroys all evil spirits in the west.

887
01:08:37,755 --> 01:08:40,005
<i>You will become a star.</i>

888
01:08:41,130 --> 01:08:43,213
<i>You will become my star,</i>

889
01:08:44,213 --> 01:08:47,547
<i>a star that illuminates the world.</i>

890
01:08:49,297 --> 01:08:51,297
I will protect you no matter what

891
01:08:53,588 --> 01:08:55,755
so that you can achieve dharma

892
01:08:57,172 --> 01:09:00,422
and enlighten
this dark world of suffering.

893
01:09:20,088 --> 01:09:22,005
He says that he loves you.

894
01:09:25,713 --> 01:09:27,963
I've served him all my life
as his disciple,

895
01:09:28,255 --> 01:09:30,338
but I have yet to hear him say that to me.

896
01:10:14,505 --> 01:10:15,547
Who are you?

897
01:10:16,922 --> 01:10:18,088
What brings you here?

898
01:10:18,172 --> 01:10:20,172
This is a restricted area.

899
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,380
Well, I somehow ended up here.

900
01:10:26,255 --> 01:10:28,213
I'm sorry,
but you must leave the premises.

901
01:10:28,297 --> 01:10:29,922
Okay, I apologize.

902
01:10:35,172 --> 01:10:36,422
Wait.

903
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:41,172
Will you jump over the fence again?

904
01:10:42,922 --> 01:10:45,672
Exit through the gate.
I'll open it for you.

905
01:10:47,547 --> 01:10:48,630
Okay.

906
01:11:09,380 --> 01:11:10,255
What the...

907
01:11:17,297 --> 01:11:18,213
"Lee Geum-hwa"?

908
01:11:55,255 --> 01:11:56,130
What?

909
01:12:17,130 --> 01:12:18,422
Hey, wait!

910
01:12:31,672 --> 01:12:32,963
Darn it.

911
01:12:57,422 --> 01:13:00,880
PESTICIDE
MEZORAN

912
01:13:01,505 --> 01:13:03,797
<i>Please hear me out.</i>

913
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:04,922
Captain Hwang.

914
01:13:05,297 --> 01:13:06,880
This is huge.

915
01:13:07,172 --> 01:13:08,255
I'm sure there's something.

916
01:13:08,338 --> 01:13:10,047
You keep spewing utter nonsense.

917
01:13:10,130 --> 01:13:11,755
The Kim Cheol-jin case too.

918
01:13:11,838 --> 01:13:13,630
There's a reason behind all of this.

919
01:13:13,713 --> 01:13:15,380
So what's the reason, then?

920
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:19,422
Kim Cheol-jin was a murderer
and an ex-convict,

921
01:13:19,505 --> 01:13:21,380
and the other people are just...

922
01:13:22,338 --> 01:13:24,922
They're just normal people.
Stop making such a fuss.

923
01:13:25,422 --> 01:13:26,297
Gosh!

924
01:13:26,838 --> 01:13:28,922
What normal person

925
01:13:29,130 --> 01:13:30,880
has an elephant at home?

926
01:13:31,963 --> 01:13:36,047
And what normal person drives
into your car just because you tailed him?

927
01:13:38,797 --> 01:13:41,505
This isn't our jurisdiction.
Contact Wonju Police Station.

928
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:43,297
Well...

929
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:46,463
Shouldn't we at least find out
the reason? No?

930
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:47,713
Wait, Captain Hwang!

931
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:29,880
"The beast will trample over the snakes

932
01:14:29,963 --> 01:14:31,880
on the fundament of the light
and win the war.

933
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:36,297
The number of the 81 snakes that will harm
the inextinguishable light is as follows."

934
01:14:36,547 --> 01:14:39,297
The number of the snakes and the light.

935
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:42,755
Pastor, this "light" that keeps coming up
in this scripture...

936
01:14:42,838 --> 01:14:45,088
In Buddhism, light symbolizes Maitreya.

937
01:14:45,172 --> 01:14:46,797
Lord Maitreya, the future Buddha.

938
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:49,505
Like the Messiah in Christianity.

939
01:14:49,588 --> 01:14:52,380
The Four Heavenly Kings
protect the Maitreya

940
01:14:52,922 --> 01:14:54,047
from the snakes.

941
01:14:55,672 --> 01:14:58,797
Then the snakes are probably like
Satan in the Bible.

942
01:15:01,297 --> 01:15:04,255
Ung-jae, there is no concept of
absolute evil in Buddhism.

943
01:15:04,338 --> 01:15:05,880
No, that's not true.

944
01:15:06,172 --> 01:15:08,213
There was Mara Papiya,
who seduced the Buddha.

945
01:15:08,297 --> 01:15:10,255
Also, Asura and Mara
in other scriptures...

946
01:15:10,338 --> 01:15:12,713
-They're all evil--
<i>-No, you got it all wrong.</i>

947
01:15:12,797 --> 01:15:15,047
They're all biases
based on Christian beliefs.

948
01:15:15,130 --> 01:15:17,922
From Mara Papiya to Asura,
if you trace their etymological roots,

949
01:15:18,005 --> 01:15:20,713
you'll learn they're just expressions
of human desires and obsession.

<i>You can call that "evil" if you wish.</i>

951
01:15:22,838 --> 01:15:24,130
Whatever, smarty-pants.

952
01:15:24,213 --> 01:15:26,422
Ung-jae, I'll call you back later.

953
01:15:26,505 --> 01:15:28,588
It's so hectic here now
because of our Christmas event.

954
01:15:28,672 --> 01:15:31,630
Why is Christmas such a big deal to you,
Buddhist monks?

955
01:15:31,713 --> 01:15:35,005
We host one of our biggest annual events
on Christmas.

956
01:15:35,213 --> 01:15:38,172
Every Christmas,
the Tibetan Buddhist master,

957
01:15:38,255 --> 01:15:41,255
Nechung Tenpa, visits Korea
as our representative.

958
01:15:41,338 --> 01:15:43,838
A Tibetan Buddhist master? Why?

959
01:15:43,922 --> 01:15:45,588
To pay his respects.

960
01:15:45,672 --> 01:15:48,797
He congratulates the cardinal
at Myeongdong Cathedral.

961
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:52,005
<i>Before that, he always visits our HQ</i>

962
01:15:52,088 --> 01:15:54,463
<i>and holds a service. The thing is...</i>

963
01:15:54,547 --> 01:15:56,672
<i>Ung-jae, he's here.</i>

964
01:15:56,755 --> 01:15:58,755
<i>All right, I'll call you later.</i>

965
01:16:04,630 --> 01:16:06,838
A Tibetan Buddhist master...

966
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:32,880
This is what came up in our search.
Dr. Goo, remember?

967
01:16:32,963 --> 01:16:35,755
"Year 1985,
the greatest Buddhist prophet."

968
01:16:35,838 --> 01:16:38,547
<i>Then in 1985,</i>

969
01:16:38,630 --> 01:16:42,838
Kim Je-seok suddenly disbanded Dongbanggyo
and disappeared.

970
01:16:45,338 --> 01:16:47,047
That's it.

971
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:52,297
He must've started writing the scriptures
after meeting Nechung Tenpa.

972
01:16:58,547 --> 01:17:03,213
Seven, one, seven, four, five, three.

973
01:17:03,297 --> 01:17:06,338
-Two, eight, one, seven...
-Hey, baldy. Pick up already.

974
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:22,922
What he learned from practicing asceticism

975
01:17:23,005 --> 01:17:24,797
is that pain changes as well.

976
01:17:30,505 --> 01:17:32,672
<i>That can exist for there is this.</i>

977
01:17:35,380 --> 01:17:38,255
<i>That can be born for this was born.</i>

978
01:17:43,047 --> 01:17:45,672
<i>That will be destroyed</i>
<i>for this is destroyed.</i>

979
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:06,672
We're off to Seoul now.

980
01:18:27,047 --> 01:18:29,172
Kim Je-seok?

981
01:19:02,172 --> 01:19:03,422
Maitreya.

982
01:20:47,047 --> 01:20:48,547
Thank you. Thank you very much.

983
01:20:48,630 --> 01:20:49,672
It's going to be okay.

984
01:22:28,213 --> 01:22:30,505

Everyone seems so excited about Christmas.

Yo-sep!

995
01:23:44,713 --> 01:23:46,963
Is Christmas a joyous day?

996
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:15,172
<i>It's a happy day, of course.</i>
<i>It's the day when Jesus was born.</i>

997
01:24:15,422 --> 01:24:18,255
<i>I've always thought about this</i>
<i>on every Christmas.</i>

998
01:24:18,755 --> 01:24:21,547
It's actually a very sad day.

999
01:24:22,422 --> 01:24:23,713
What do you mean?

1000
01:24:23,797 --> 01:24:27,797
So many babies in Bethlehem
lost their lives for Jesus to be born

1001
01:24:28,547 --> 01:24:32,255
because Herod heard from the Magi
that the king of the Jews had been born.

1002
01:24:32,422 --> 01:24:35,338
"When Herod realized
that he had been outwitted by the Magi,

1003
01:24:35,422 --> 01:24:37,922
he was furious, and he gave orders
to kill all the boys

1004
01:24:38,005 --> 01:24:40,922
in Bethlehem and its vicinity
who were two years old and under..."

1005
01:24:41,047 --> 01:24:42,463
<i>The Gospel of Matthew,</i> 2:16.

1006
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:04,963
Mister.

1007
01:25:06,130 --> 01:25:07,297
The thing is...

1008
01:25:07,380 --> 01:25:11,130
"Those snakes will have beautiful eyes
and sweet tongues."

1009
01:25:11,213 --> 01:25:14,505
-I don't care about dying,
-"Do not listen to their words."

1010
01:25:15,047 --> 01:25:17,047
but can I at least know the reason?

1011
01:25:17,797 --> 01:25:19,630
Why do I have to die?

1012
01:25:22,213 --> 01:25:24,755
Jecheon in the west, Taebaek in the east,
Jeongseon in the north,

1013
01:25:24,838 --> 01:25:26,380
and Danyang in the south.

1014
01:25:26,588 --> 01:25:28,338
There was a center point.

1015
01:25:28,922 --> 01:25:30,172
Kim Je-seok's hometown.

1016
01:25:31,672 --> 01:25:32,547
Yeongwol.

1017
01:25:32,630 --> 01:25:36,505
In the same spot, the snake that will harm
the light is born 100 years later.

1018
01:25:36,588 --> 01:25:39,297
Kim Je-seok was born in Yeongwol
in 1899, right?

1019
01:25:39,380 --> 01:25:40,797
And 100 years after that...

1020
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:41,963
Year 1999.

1021
01:25:45,755 --> 01:25:49,213
He believed that something born
in Yeongwol would end up harming him.

1022
01:25:50,338 --> 01:25:51,547
And...

1023
01:25:52,547 --> 01:25:54,838
"The day the snake sheds its first blood.

1024
01:25:55,588 --> 01:25:57,130
The snake nestling in the girl's body."

There really is a demon

She's my twin sister.

She was born with me,

1054
01:27:43,047 --> 01:27:46,130
so she's evil too, right?

1055
01:27:47,588 --> 01:27:49,338
Kill her as well.

1056
01:27:50,630 --> 01:27:52,130
So she can be born again.

1057

resident registration numbers.

1070
01:28:44,213 --> 01:28:46,380
I thought they looked like
resident registration numbers,

1071
01:28:46,463 --> 01:28:48,422
but I wondered why
there were only ten digits.

1072
01:28:49,213 --> 01:28:51,838
The birth year and the seventh digit,
which indicates the sex.

1073
01:28:51,922 --> 01:28:53,713
Those are set, so get rid of them and...

1074
01:28:53,922 --> 01:28:55,005
Ten.

1075
01:28:58,047 --> 01:29:00,505
That's why the scriptures
were completed in 2000.

There are 81 in total.

1079
01:29:10,422 --> 01:29:12,005
Hence, the "81 evil enemies."

1080
01:29:12,088 --> 01:29:14,547
There are three all girls' middle schools.

1081
01:29:15,463 --> 01:29:18,380
If I add up all girls in ninth grade...

1082

01:30:51,338 --> 01:30:53,297
Awake to help us

1106
01:30:54,547 --> 01:30:56,588
and behold.

1107
01:30:58,088 --> 01:31:00,755
<i>Do not hide your face from us.</i>

1108
01:31:00,838 --> 01:31:03,838
<i>Do not turn your servants away in anger.</i>

1109
01:31:04,922 --> 01:31:07,547
<i>You have been our helper.</i>

1110
01:31:08,713 --> 01:31:10,672
<i>God, our savior.</i>

1111
01:31:12,422 --> 01:31:14,380
<i>Do not reject us</i>

1112
01:31:16,047 --> 01:31:17,505
<i>or forsake us.</i>

1113
01:32:13,505 --> 01:32:15,130
Son, what took you so long?

1114
01:32:16,380 --> 01:32:17,963
It took way too long.

1115
01:32:20,713 --> 01:32:22,047
Who are you?

1116
01:32:23,588 --> 01:32:25,380
I am the wailing one.

1117
01:32:27,463 --> 01:32:29,422
I have been waiting for you.

1118
01:32:31,172 --> 01:32:32,380
Hurry.

1119
01:32:34,255 --> 01:32:36,088
Too much blood has been shed.

1120
01:32:53,922 --> 01:32:55,130
Do you see it?

1121
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,547
Can't you feel it?

1122
01:32:59,963 --> 01:33:01,630
I am your sustenance.

1123
01:33:03,922 --> 01:33:05,422
Open your heart.

1124
01:33:07,505 --> 01:33:09,088
I shall choose you.

1125
01:33:40,255 --> 01:33:45,338
<i>Hushaby, my baby</i>

1126

1132
01:34:22,922 --> 01:34:28,005
<i>Fall asleep in Mama's arms</i>

1133
01:34:29,005 --> 01:34:31,380
Stop!

1134
01:34:44,005 --> 01:34:45,963
Who the hell are you?

1135
01:34:47,672 --> 01:34:50,047
I am the one who cries with you

1136
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:53,672
when you shed blood.

1137
01:34:56,255 --> 01:34:58,130
What do you want from me?

1138
01:35:25,922 --> 01:35:27,088
Pastor.

1139
01:35:27,672 --> 01:35:28,922
In total,

1140
01:35:29,838 --> 01:35:31,713
how many girls
do you think they've killed?

1141
01:35:38,380 --> 01:35:39,422
Look up.

1142
01:35:39,797 --> 01:35:41,213
It's Jeong Na-han.

1143
01:36:02,005 --> 01:36:03,630
What did you do to Lee Geum-hwa?

1144
01:36:03,713 --> 01:36:05,672
Answer me, Jeong Na-han!

1145
01:36:08,255 --> 01:36:10,463
Kim Je-seok fooled all of you.

1146
01:36:10,547 --> 01:36:12,838
Do you even realize what you're doing?

1147
01:36:12,922 --> 01:36:16,297
How many innocent kids have you killed?

1148
01:36:34,005 --> 01:36:35,755
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

1149
01:36:36,797 --> 01:36:39,755
Check the mark on the man
whom you call Father.

1150
01:36:46,255 --> 01:36:48,755
He is the snake.

1151
01:36:50,963 --> 01:36:53,713
Kill him.

1152
01:37:06,713 --> 01:37:08,047
No.

1153
01:37:11,172 --> 01:37:12,755
Father is the light.

1154
01:37:16,797 --> 01:37:18,672
Father is the light.

1155
01:37:27,505 --> 01:37:28,588
Father.

1156
01:37:29,713 --> 01:37:31,922
Say something, Father.

1157
01:37:34,255 --> 01:37:35,172
Please?

1158
01:37:38,630 --> 01:37:40,005
Can you hear me?

1159
01:37:43,713 --> 01:37:47,380
Say something like you used to. Please!

1160
01:37:57,047 --> 01:37:58,380
I'm sorry, Father.

1161
01:38:07,130 --> 01:38:08,463
What brings you here at this hour?

1162
01:38:11,463 --> 01:38:12,672
You might make him sicker.

1163
01:38:15,047 --> 01:38:16,505
At that girl's house,

1164
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:20,338
there was her twin sister
whose birth was never registered.

1165
01:38:21,213 --> 01:38:23,713
It seemed as if
she had been waiting for me.

1166
01:38:27,755 --> 01:38:28,755
So?

1167
01:38:29,172 --> 01:38:30,588
Did you just leave?

1168
01:38:35,130 --> 01:38:36,547
She told me to go have a look.

1169
01:38:38,255 --> 01:38:39,963
She said I should check the mark.

1170
01:38:40,922 --> 01:38:42,088
What mark?

1171
01:38:48,713 --> 01:38:50,172
Six fingers.

1172
01:38:59,255 --> 01:39:00,422
Gwangmok.

1173
01:39:00,963 --> 01:39:02,380
That's what the snake's tongue does.

1174
01:39:02,463 --> 01:39:03,838
The tongue has fooled you.

1175
01:39:06,005 --> 01:39:08,797
Come with me.
There's something I'd like to show you.

1176
01:39:16,172 --> 01:39:20,422
I heard monks used to give elephants
to kings as gifts in ancient India.

1177
01:39:27,005 --> 01:39:29,047
Look at that elephant's eyes.

1178
01:39:30,338 --> 01:39:31,505
What do you feel?

1179
01:39:34,297 --> 01:39:35,588
They just...

1180
01:39:38,797 --> 01:39:40,088
look cold.

1181
01:39:46,713 --> 01:39:48,922
Fearing elephants' eyes is a sign

1182
01:39:49,922 --> 01:39:51,463
that you have an evil heart.

1183
01:39:51,922 --> 01:39:54,505
Monks in India gifted the kings
with these creatures

1184
01:39:55,130 --> 01:39:57,505
so that the kings could look
into their eyes every day.

1185
01:39:59,422 --> 01:40:01,713
The whole thing, including shipping,
cost us 90 million won.

1186
01:40:23,922 --> 01:40:26,505
Take your time
and wait for your salvation.

1187
01:40:28,422 --> 01:40:29,547
Why...

1188
01:40:30,755 --> 01:40:33,088
Why aren't you afraid of elephants?

1189
01:41:01,755 --> 01:41:02,963
Kim Je-seok.

1190
01:41:05,922 --> 01:41:08,213
Are you really the man who became a god?

1191
01:41:12,005 --> 01:41:13,922
I heard you're real.

1192
01:41:15,297 --> 01:41:16,963
I heard you're a god.

1193
01:41:20,088 --> 01:41:22,088
Then you shouldn't be bedridden like this.

1194
01:42:13,172 --> 01:42:14,838
Finally, we found it.

1195
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:17,172
Don't go.

1196
01:42:18,838 --> 01:42:20,213
It's dangerous.

1197
01:42:28,213 --> 01:42:29,630
My dear Myeong-hui.

1198
01:42:30,630 --> 01:42:32,088
You've aged a lot.

1199
01:42:44,963 --> 01:42:48,172
STUDENT RECORDS

1200

1204
01:43:32,463 --> 01:43:33,755
I should just enlist in the army.

1205
01:43:36,380 --> 01:43:37,505
Yo-sep!

1206
01:43:46,838 --> 01:43:48,880
What pains you the most now

1207
01:43:49,838 --> 01:43:52,213
is the fact that the man
whom you guys used to call Father

1208
01:43:52,963 --> 01:43:55,172
was nothing but a lifeless meat.

1209
01:43:55,255 --> 01:43:57,297
They were just

1210
01:43:58,630 --> 01:44:00,838
innocent kids born with pitiful fates.

1211
01:44:01,880 --> 01:44:03,672
There were no "snakes" to begin with.

1212
01:44:05,255 --> 01:44:06,422
<i>You're wrong.</i>

1213
01:44:07,922 --> 01:44:09,797
<i>I met one.</i>

1214
01:44:11,880 --> 01:44:14,505
It told me to kill him.

1215
01:45:27,172 --> 01:45:29,172
Oh, boy. I'm so sorry.

1216
01:45:29,463 --> 01:45:31,630
Jeez, what the heck.
I can't believe this happened.

1217
01:45:31,713 --> 01:45:34,380
Gosh, the road is so slippery.

1218
01:45:34,963 --> 01:45:37,213
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

1219
01:45:37,713 --> 01:45:38,838
God.

1220
01:45:41,505 --> 01:45:42,922
I'm sorry.

1221
01:45:44,713 --> 01:45:45,797
We meet again.

1222
01:45:46,213 --> 01:45:47,797
Who are you, really?

1223
01:45:49,422 --> 01:45:50,505
I'm...

1224
01:45:51,255 --> 01:45:53,338
Pastor Park, the crook buster.

FAR EASTERN RELIGION RESEARCH INSTITUTE
PARK UNG-JAE

1226
01:45:59,588 --> 01:46:00,838
But I guess

1227
01:46:01,755 --> 01:46:03,505
I got the wrong person today.

1228
01:46:06,463 --> 01:46:08,963
No worries. You can just go.

1229
01:46:11,005 --> 01:46:13,463
You can't leave like this.
Call your insurance company.

1230
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:14,922
Hey!

1231
01:46:16,755 --> 01:46:19,130
Hey, Pungsa Kim Je-seok!

1232
01:46:26,338 --> 01:46:29,422
<i>Only few people got to meet him in person.</i>

1233
01:46:29,838 --> 01:46:33,630
<i>I heard only his closest disciples</i>
<i>were allowed to meet with him.</i>

1234
01:46:42,172 --> 01:46:43,963
Jeez, it was true.

1235
01:46:45,713 --> 01:46:47,380
<i>The inextinguishable...</i>

1236
01:46:47,463 --> 01:46:50,130
Master...

1237
01:46:50,213 --> 01:46:53,088
Light that doesn't age.

1238
01:46:54,213 --> 01:46:57,422
Please kill me.

1239
01:47:06,130 --> 01:47:07,880
Thanks for all your hard work.

1240
01:47:13,213 --> 01:47:14,922
Really, thanks for everything.

1241
01:47:45,130 --> 01:47:47,088
The dragon turned into a snake.

1242
01:47:57,880 --> 01:47:59,172
I'm getting a whiff of blood.

1243
01:48:05,005 --> 01:48:06,297
Who are you?

1244
01:48:08,422 --> 01:48:10,880
Answer me. Who are you?

1245
01:48:10,963 --> 01:48:13,505
Do not talk or move.

1246
01:48:15,338 --> 01:48:18,797
Your intestines and lungs
are almost done for.

1247
01:48:23,755 --> 01:48:25,880
The man you boys called Father
all your lives

1248
01:48:27,922 --> 01:48:30,422
was also my disciple
who devoted his entire life to me.

1249
01:48:31,005 --> 01:48:32,172
You deceived me.

1250
01:48:32,505 --> 01:48:33,797
I am...

1251
01:48:35,380 --> 01:48:36,797
the light.

1252
01:48:38,338 --> 01:48:40,880
You are the stars that protect me.

1253
01:48:41,922 --> 01:48:43,255
Do not be sad

1254
01:48:43,588 --> 01:48:45,338
about what you boys did.

1255
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:47,463
To soldiers, killing is a patriotic act.

1256
01:48:47,547 --> 01:48:49,838
-Shut your mouth!
-Shush.

1257
01:48:57,922 --> 01:49:01,755
Time makes humans
rush through their lives and die.

1258
01:49:05,130 --> 01:49:06,463
However,

1259
01:49:07,713 --> 01:49:09,380
I won the race against time.

1260
01:49:10,255 --> 01:49:11,547
I am...

1261
01:49:13,172 --> 01:49:15,255
-the inextinguishable light.
-Shut the hell up.

1262
01:49:15,338 --> 01:49:16,547
There are

1263
01:49:17,172 --> 01:49:19,505
many things that I must do
for this world from now on.

1264
01:49:19,588 --> 01:49:20,922
I must live.

1265
01:49:22,922 --> 01:49:24,547
I am giving you a chance.

1266
01:49:25,130 --> 01:49:26,130
Beast.

1267
01:49:26,713 --> 01:49:28,255
Serve me.

1268
01:49:37,422 --> 01:49:40,797
No, you are just a predator
who is desperate to live.

1269
01:49:47,213 --> 01:49:48,505
You shouldn't have done that.

1270
01:49:48,588 --> 01:49:51,797
-Those kids did nothing wrong.
-You don't understand.

1271
01:49:52,255 --> 01:49:54,213
Those girls cry every night.

1272
01:49:54,963 --> 01:49:57,672
Have you even heard their cries?

1273
01:49:57,755 --> 01:49:59,255
You can't understand.

1274
01:50:05,463 --> 01:50:07,922
Slitting your throat a hundred times
won't be enough.

1275
01:50:11,672 --> 01:50:13,005
<i>The sad eyes</i>

1276
01:50:13,797 --> 01:50:15,588
will twist the snake's neck.

1277
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:24,172
Slitting your throat a hundred times
won't be enough!

1278
01:50:30,755 --> 01:50:32,797
Everything will be turned upside down.

1279
01:50:35,255 --> 01:50:37,088
The earth will become the sky,

1280
01:50:39,922 --> 01:50:42,380
<i>and the sky will become the earth.</i>

1281
01:51:17,047 --> 01:51:18,380
The wise one.

1282
01:51:19,255 --> 01:51:21,047
Grab the snake's foot.

1283
01:51:27,338 --> 01:51:28,797
I cannot

1284
01:51:30,255 --> 01:51:32,463
die by your hand here.

1285
01:52:35,755 --> 01:52:37,880
The snake will burn up in flames.

1286
01:52:56,047 --> 01:52:57,505
-And finally,
-<i>And finally,</i>

1287
01:52:59,463 --> 01:53:02,338
-dharma will be achieved.
-<i>dharma will be achieved.</i>

1288
01:54:43,880 --> 01:54:44,838
Yes, it's...

1289
01:54:44,922 --> 01:54:46,713
That's right. Right after the tunnel.

1290
01:54:48,755 --> 01:54:49,672
Yes.

1291
01:54:51,422 --> 01:54:52,588
Oh, I see.

1292
01:54:53,338 --> 01:54:56,005
A car flipped over and caught on fire.

1293
01:54:57,505 --> 01:54:58,963
Yes.

1294
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:13,047
Yes, okay. Please hurry.

1295
01:55:13,463 --> 01:55:14,463
Yes.

1296
01:55:15,130 --> 01:55:16,630
Okay, got it.

1297
01:55:22,755 --> 01:55:24,172
I...

1298
01:56:50,838 --> 01:56:52,338
Forensics should...

1299
01:56:56,172 --> 01:56:57,255
Okay, got it.

1300
01:56:59,213 --> 01:57:02,255
We heard from Lee Geum-hwa. She's fine.

1301
01:57:05,213 --> 01:57:07,213
-Okay.
-But apparently,

1302
01:57:07,297 --> 01:57:09,755
she had a twin sister
whose birth was never registered.

1303
01:57:10,422 --> 01:57:11,630
That girl died.

1304
01:57:11,713 --> 01:57:12,963
Gosh.

1305
01:57:35,005 --> 01:57:36,088
Pastor.

1306
01:57:38,297 --> 01:57:39,338
Yes?

1307
01:57:39,880 --> 01:57:42,672
What did he say in his final moments?

1308
01:57:45,838 --> 01:57:46,838
Who?

1309
01:57:48,255 --> 01:57:49,422
Jeong Na-han.

1310
01:57:50,672 --> 01:57:52,380
It looked like he was saying something.

1311
01:57:55,922 --> 01:57:57,088
Well...

1312
01:58:01,380 --> 01:58:02,880
He said he was cold.

1313
01:58:14,463 --> 01:58:16,338
<i>Where are you?</i>

1314
01:58:17,297 --> 01:58:19,213
<i>Have you forgotten about us?</i>

1315
01:58:20,130 --> 01:58:24,880
<i>Why do you keep shedding tears</i>
<i>with your face covered?</i>

1316
01:58:25,380 --> 01:58:26,672
<i>Wake up.</i>

1317
01:58:27,463 --> 01:58:30,422
<i>Listen to our cries and sighs.</i>

1318
01:58:30,797 --> 01:58:32,172
<i>Get up.</i>

1319
01:58:32,588 --> 01:58:36,672
<i>Save us from evil with your mercy</i>

1320
01:58:36,755 --> 01:58:39,297
<i>and listen to our prayers.</i>

1321
02:02:53,505 --> 02:02:56,505
