Hey, Jeon Tae-ryong!

17
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:20,097
These chips are crushed to bits!

18
00:02:20,184 --> 00:02:22,391
Nobody wants broken chips.

19
00:02:22,478 --> 00:02:24,894
Your brother didn't teach you better?

20
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,179
Sorry.

21

the US CV with a mock torpedo?

24

Captain seems pissed off about it.

25
00:02:34,677 --> 00:02:37,579
Because it was Commander Kang,

26
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:38,970
not him that hit the target.

27
00:02:39,057 --> 00:02:42,662
Kang looks like an idler,

28
00:02:42,749 --> 00:02:44,844
but he must get his job done.

29
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,806

30
00:02:48,893 --> 00:02:53,012
So not just a pretty face...

31
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:54,402
He studied abroad, right?

32
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:56,383
I bet he's never used
public transportation.

33
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,164
To be honest...

34
00:02:59,251 --> 00:03:02,466
I feel like he's younger
than me sometimes.

35
00:03:02,552 --> 00:03:06,070
He reminds me of my dog

36
00:03:06,157 --> 00:03:07,471
with his big, bright eyes.

37
00:03:07,557 --> 00:03:11,009
Her name is Poppy. I miss her.

Hey.

39
00:03:12,076 --> 00:03:15,569

talking behind my back.

For victory!

41
00:03:18,506 --> 00:03:24,675
At ease. But this dream felt so real...

42
00:03:24,762 --> 00:03:29,993
as if it really happened.

43
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,836
Is your Poppy that good-looking?

44
00:03:31,922 --> 00:03:34,129
Sorry? No, sir.

45
00:03:34,216 --> 00:03:37,709
No, sir?

46
00:03:37,796 --> 00:03:39,742
And do I look younger than you?

47
00:03:40,264 --> 00:03:41,585
My apologies.

48

53
00:04:03,445 --> 00:04:05,585

83

- Did I?
- Yes.

85
00:05:49,873 --> 00:05:54,338

86
00:05:54,426 --> 00:05:57,171
You be the commander if you want.

87

The crew in the stern were killed

Wake up. It's me.

171
00:13:19,662 --> 00:13:22,008
Sir...

172
00:13:22,096 --> 00:13:26,023
Good to see you, man. For victory...

173
00:13:26,892 --> 00:13:28,352
Hot!

174
00:13:29,256 --> 00:13:31,446
You don't go home these days?

175
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,199
No, I like the fish.

176
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:39,839
They're my babies.

177
00:13:39,926 --> 00:13:41,612
Besides, I get visitors all the time.

178
00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:44,462
For a drink,

179
00:13:44,548 --> 00:13:48,007
for a pity party,

180
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:51,117
and some just stay for good.

181
00:13:51,674 --> 00:13:53,325
Who's staying for good?

182
00:13:53,411 --> 00:13:56,539
Tae-ryong. Our good-looking boy.

183
00:13:58,312 --> 00:14:01,145
He ended up staying for good,

184
00:14:01,232 --> 00:14:03,421
that poor boy.

185
00:14:12,701 --> 00:14:13,953
Thank you.

186
00:14:16,942 --> 00:14:19,688
Our cook made the best ramen.

187
00:14:27,508 --> 00:14:30,080
There's something you don't know.

188
00:14:31,331 --> 00:14:32,687
What is it?

189
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,499
Damn it...

190
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:44,105
I'm not supposed to tell anyone.

191
00:14:44,191 --> 00:14:46,242
What is it?

192
00:14:46,798 --> 00:14:51,091
Sir.

193
00:14:51,177 --> 00:14:54,810
Tae-ryong keeps saying weird stuff

194
00:14:54,897 --> 00:14:57,174
about people he pledges to kill.

195
00:14:57,261 --> 00:15:01,588
I told him he should never do that.

196
00:15:01,674 --> 00:15:03,395
But he just laughs it off

197
00:15:03,481 --> 00:15:05,446
and won't let me in his room.

198
00:15:05,532 --> 00:15:08,278
He just won't listen.

199
00:15:10,433 --> 00:15:12,815
Officer Roh.

200
00:15:12,901 --> 00:15:13,944
Look at me straight.

201
00:15:14,778 --> 00:15:16,168
Sir.

202
00:15:19,331 --> 00:15:21,660
PO Jeon Tae-ryong is dead.

203
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,856
No, sir.

204
00:15:26,942 --> 00:15:28,472
Tae-ryong is gone.

205
00:15:29,445 --> 00:15:33,581
No. He's not dead.

206
00:15:35,493 --> 00:15:37,527
I saw him yesterday.

207
00:15:37,613 --> 00:15:39,108
Come to your senses.

208
00:15:48,145 --> 00:15:49,170
Yes.

209
00:15:49,256 --> 00:15:52,072
<i>Sir, there was an explosion

Hold tight!

308
00:23:10,983 --> 00:23:12,423

310

- Call history, too.
- Yes, sir.

Why don't you go home first?

316
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:38,250
I'll text Dad.

317

I'll get some hot dogs.

Whose house was it?

335
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:36,503
<i>A navy officer's.</i>

336
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,650
Which one?

337
00:24:37,737 --> 00:24:39,214
<i>Like you would know?</i>

338
00:24:39,301 --> 00:24:41,473
- I might.
<i>- Go home now.</i>

339
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:43,178
- No.
<i>- I'm being nice to you.</i>

340
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,741
<i>Do you want me to stop?</i>

341
00:24:44,827 --> 00:24:46,201
I definitely don't want that.

342
00:24:46,287 --> 00:24:48,372
<i>- I won't say it again.</i>
- It's a goal!

343
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:54,055
It's cracked.

344
00:24:54,142 --> 00:24:55,880
Hey, excuse me.

345
00:25:22,886 --> 00:25:25,302
<i>You know the game
is broadcast live, right?</i>

346
00:25:25,389 --> 00:25:27,700
<i>If you call for an
evacuation, it'll go off.</i>

347
00:25:27,787 --> 00:25:29,369
I'm at S11. It's not here.

348
00:25:29,455 --> 00:25:32,566
<i>It's not your usual bomb.</i>

349
00:25:32,652 --> 00:25:34,755
<i>It's triggered by noise.</i>

350
00:25:34,842 --> 00:25:36,614
<i>You see the skybox?</i>

351
00:25:37,276 --> 00:25:39,951
<i>If the noise hits 100 decibels,
the time will drop by half.</i>

352
00:25:41,202 --> 00:25:43,480
<i>It'll be fun...</i>

353
00:25:43,566 --> 00:25:45,044
<i>if they score a goal.</i>

354
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:47,007
Officer, you just bumped...

355
00:25:50,101 --> 00:25:52,916
- Where's the bomb?
- Bomb?

356
00:25:53,715 --> 00:25:56,583
<i>You can't stop it</i>

357
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,234
<i>because you can't move it.</i>

358
00:26:00,632 --> 00:26:02,369
What's Kang Do-young
from Halla doing here?

359
00:26:08,661 --> 00:26:10,312
You're Commander Kang, right?

360
00:26:10,398 --> 00:26:12,501
I heard you say "bomb."

361
00:26:12,588 --> 00:26:15,403
I brought my kid here.

362
00:26:16,029 --> 00:26:17,333
There's a bomb in this stadium.

363
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,905
What? Shouldn't you evacuate people?

364
00:26:19,991 --> 00:26:21,260
It'd blow before we could.

365
00:26:21,347 --> 00:26:23,068
Loud noises trigger it.

366
00:26:23,155 --> 00:26:24,066
This is a soccer stadium.

367
00:26:24,153 --> 00:26:25,900
How could there not be loud noise?

368
00:26:27,777 --> 00:26:29,654
Stop the game.

369
00:26:30,037 --> 00:26:31,288
What, me?

370
00:26:32,574 --> 00:26:33,738
How?

371
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:35,945
<i>Ha Jae-wook.</i>

372
00:26:42,132 --> 00:26:44,478
<i>A penalty kick is given to Busan.</i>

373
00:26:44,565 --> 00:26:47,468
<i>He didn't even touch the ball,</i>

374
00:26:47,554 --> 00:26:50,839
<i>but it didn't stop him from
tackling from behind.</i>

375
00:26:50,925 --> 00:26:53,149
<i>What a smashing move!</i>

376
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:59,475
- Are you on your way home?
- No, we're still here.

377
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:01,891
Put Dad on the phone.

378
00:27:01,978 --> 00:27:04,637
<i>He's gone to get some hot dogs.</i>

379
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:06,097
He's driving me nuts.

380
00:27:06,183 --> 00:27:09,905
<i>It's a penalty kick for Busan.</i>

381
00:27:09,991 --> 00:27:11,218
<i>What's happening?</i>

382
00:27:11,305 --> 00:27:13,744
<i>It's a field invasion.</i>

383
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,377
<i>Oh, no.</i>

384
00:27:15,463 --> 00:27:16,732
What a psycho.

385
00:27:16,819 --> 00:27:18,470
- I know!
- What an attention seeker.

386
00:27:18,557 --> 00:27:20,939
He even kicks the ball.

387
00:27:21,025 --> 00:27:23,997
I feel sorry for his wife.

388
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:26,004
He kind of looks like your dad.

389
00:27:26,091 --> 00:27:27,005
<i>He's covered his face,</i>

390
00:27:27,092 --> 00:27:28,671
<i>but he's making me blush somehow.</i>

391
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:30,983
That's appalling.

392
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,575
<i>Please, not during an
international match!</i>

393
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:33,652
They'd better drag him out quickly.

394
00:27:33,676 --> 00:27:37,396
Look at him...

395
00:27:38,021 --> 00:27:40,124
It's Dad.

396
00:27:40,211 --> 00:27:43,044
<i>There should be a law to
punish people like him.</i>

397
00:27:43,131 --> 00:27:45,146
Isn't that your husband?

398
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,473
No, it's not.

399
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,237
- It was him.
- I said no!

400
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:40,740
You have no evidence.

401
00:28:40,827 --> 00:28:42,409
What the...

402
00:28:42,495 --> 00:28:45,485
Kang Do-young... Hey!

403
00:28:47,709 --> 00:28:48,630
Goodness.

404
00:28:48,717 --> 00:28:50,646
What is he doing?

405
00:28:50,733 --> 00:28:52,384
Minister, there's a bomb here.

406
00:28:52,471 --> 00:28:54,574
Commander Kang.

407
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,764
What are you doing?

408
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:59,943
What do you mean, a bomb?

409
00:29:02,064 --> 00:29:03,645
What's going on?

410
00:29:03,732 --> 00:29:05,018
I'm sorry, sir.

411
00:29:05,678 --> 00:29:07,903
What's wrong with you?

412
00:29:10,544 --> 00:29:14,211
It's nothing. Let's keep
watching the game.

413
00:29:14,298 --> 00:29:16,870
Kang, do you know something?

414
00:29:24,308 --> 00:29:25,681
It must be a bomb.

415
00:29:25,768 --> 00:29:26,810
Let's get out.

416
00:29:33,971 --> 00:29:36,820
I can't see my son.

417
00:29:41,895 --> 00:29:44,276
Min! Let go of me!

418
00:29:44,362 --> 00:29:45,892
- Please find my boy.
- Mom!

419
00:30:09,944 --> 00:30:12,724
Byung-gu! Stay there, Son.

420
00:30:40,704 --> 00:30:44,596
Min-ho! You okay, baby?

421
00:31:06,528 --> 00:31:07,528
You okay?

422
00:31:09,621 --> 00:31:10,803
You're bleeding.

423
00:31:13,341 --> 00:31:17,494
<i>Did you have to go so
far to save the minister?</i>

424
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,849
What do you want?

425
00:31:18,936 --> 00:31:20,449
<i>Torpedo no. 3 will be launched.</i>

426
00:31:20,535 --> 00:31:22,707
<i>Cheonsa Apartments playground.</i>

427
00:31:22,794 --> 00:31:26,062
<i>By the way, CPO Jang
was dispatched there.</i>

428
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:31,258
<i>Looks like she'll defuse it herself.</i>

429
00:31:31,344 --> 00:31:32,839
<i>It won't be easy.</i>

430
00:31:34,925 --> 00:31:37,305
<i>I'll launch torpedo
no. 4 in a public pool.</i>

431
00:31:37,392 --> 00:31:40,555
<i>It's packed with kids today.</i>

432
00:31:42,918 --> 00:31:44,552
<i>Again, excessive noise will set it off.</i>

433
00:31:45,978 --> 00:31:47,576
<i>Where will you go?</i>

434
00:31:48,236 --> 00:31:49,796
<i>If you don't choose,
I'll detonate both.</i>

435
00:31:53,172 --> 00:31:55,605
<i>Don't hang up on me.</i>

436
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,681
<i>What's your choice?</i>

437
00:31:58,767 --> 00:32:01,270
<i>The pool or the playground?</i>

438
00:32:04,885 --> 00:32:06,849
I'll go to the pool.

439
00:32:06,936 --> 00:32:12,028
<i>But then your wife could die.</i>

440
00:32:12,114 --> 00:32:14,787
Listen. If anything happens to her,

441
00:32:14,873 --> 00:32:16,407
you're dead.

442
00:32:16,494 --> 00:32:17,886
<i>You'd better hurry,</i>

443
00:32:17,972 --> 00:32:20,317
<i>or the pool's going to go.</i>

444
00:32:22,785 --> 00:32:26,782
What's going on? Can I ask you?

445
00:32:28,137 --> 00:32:30,779
A rubber duck... A water park?

446
00:32:31,787 --> 00:32:33,142
But I can't swim.

447
00:32:34,915 --> 00:32:37,487
How come they haven't been evacuated?

448
00:32:38,147 --> 00:32:39,469
Just honk.

449
00:32:54,761 --> 00:32:57,125
Is that the site?

450
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:01,226
A bomb in a playground?

451
00:33:01,851 --> 00:33:02,906
Shall I bring in the robot?

452
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,737
There's no time for
that. I'll go right in.

453
00:33:23,054 --> 00:33:24,409
Your hand is bleeding.

454
00:33:29,379 --> 00:33:32,751
- What's your name?
- Oh Byung-gu.

455
00:33:33,515 --> 00:33:35,444
Thanks, Byung-gu.

456
00:33:35,531 --> 00:33:38,260
Mom gave it to me to wipe my nose.

457
00:33:38,346 --> 00:33:40,640
But I never used it.

458
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:45,645
Thanks, man. You're
brave like your dad.

459
00:33:47,662 --> 00:33:49,816
He got it after me, not his mom.

460
00:33:57,706 --> 00:33:59,188
You can get home on your own, right?

461
00:33:59,274 --> 00:34:00,356
Dad, you're on YouTube.

462
00:34:00,442 --> 00:34:01,530
That's not me, Son.

463
00:34:09,976 --> 00:34:11,626
What are you doing?

464
00:34:11,713 --> 00:34:13,295
Let me borrow your car for the day.

465
00:34:13,381 --> 00:34:16,840
What are you talking about?

466
00:34:16,926 --> 00:34:18,508
I haven't even paid it off yet.

467
00:34:18,595 --> 00:34:19,482
I'll compensate you.

468
00:34:19,569 --> 00:34:21,271
That's not the point...

469
00:34:24,225 --> 00:34:25,494
I can't be responsible for you.

470
00:34:25,581 --> 00:34:27,180
Just make sure my car's all right.

471
00:34:32,776 --> 00:34:35,887
He's riding with me right now.

472
00:34:35,974 --> 00:34:37,972
<i>Why the hell did you show your belly?</i>

473
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:39,258
I'm not crazy.

474
00:34:39,345 --> 00:34:41,448
I did it for a good reason.

475
00:34:41,534 --> 00:34:42,727
<i>You're after a scoop, aren't you?</i>

476
00:34:42,751 --> 00:34:44,299
Could you call my wife, please?

477
00:34:44,385 --> 00:34:45,385
<i>- Tell me!</i>
- Sure.

478
00:34:45,462 --> 00:34:47,157
I've got to go.

479
00:34:47,243 --> 00:34:48,121
- I have to call the wife.
<i>- What wife?</i>

480
00:34:48,208 --> 00:34:50,485
- Not you. Another wife.
<i>- Are you crazy?</i>

481
00:34:50,572 --> 00:34:52,459
I mean, it's an emergency, and...

482
00:34:52,545 --> 00:34:54,499
Never mind.

483
00:34:55,194 --> 00:34:56,324
Call her for me.

484
00:34:56,411 --> 00:34:58,322
My phone's being monitored.

485
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:01,310
He's got a spy app on your phone,

486
00:35:01,378 --> 00:35:03,118
so he's no amateur.

487
00:35:07,185 --> 00:35:09,532
<i>You'll be connected to voicemail...</i>

488
00:35:09,618 --> 00:35:14,119
Why don't you tell me? I'm a...

489
00:35:14,207 --> 00:35:16,344
I've got to know so I can help.

490
00:35:16,431 --> 00:35:17,368
A bomb blew up in front of me.

491
00:35:17,455 --> 00:35:18,899
I can't just lend you my car.

492
00:35:25,085 --> 00:35:26,684
Why don't you get off?

493
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,595
What if I say no?

494
00:35:30,681 --> 00:35:34,626
Commander.

495
00:35:34,713 --> 00:35:35,713
Were you this peremptory

496
00:35:35,746 --> 00:35:36,938
on the submarine, too?

497
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:41,977
Yes, I was.

498
00:35:45,696 --> 00:35:48,321
Do you know how embarrassing
it was in the stadium?

499
00:35:48,408 --> 00:35:50,191
That moment will be permanently

500
00:35:50,277 --> 00:35:51,622
memorialized on YouTube.

501
00:35:51,709 --> 00:35:52,709
Making a fool of myself

502
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,941
in front of my son.

503
00:35:55,462 --> 00:35:56,627
Hold tight.

504
00:35:56,714 --> 00:35:58,313
Hold tight to what?

505
00:36:00,572 --> 00:36:03,074
What the hell?

506
00:36:05,403 --> 00:36:06,794
I'm not holding tight yet.

507
00:36:08,982 --> 00:36:10,495
There's a man! A man!

508
00:36:10,582 --> 00:36:11,764
A car!

509
00:36:13,363 --> 00:36:14,371
A gate, a gate, a gate!

510
00:36:20,696 --> 00:36:22,296
Signboard!

511
00:36:29,629 --> 00:36:30,846
Look, look, look, look!

512
00:36:38,178 --> 00:36:39,935
We need police cooperation.

513
00:36:40,022 --> 00:36:41,835
<i>Not the police.</i>

514
00:36:41,921 --> 00:36:43,160
<i>We catch the culprit ourselves.</i>

515
00:36:43,184 --> 00:36:44,523
He set off two already,

516
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,504
and both bombings are related to Kang.

517
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:47,645
I sent you a file about the suspect.

518
00:36:47,669 --> 00:36:49,753
Look into it.

519
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:54,237
What is it?

520
00:36:55,141 --> 00:36:57,383
Get access to police surveillance.

521
00:36:57,468 --> 00:36:59,051
Locate Kang no matter what.

522
00:36:59,138 --> 00:37:00,302
Yes, sir.

523
00:37:00,389 --> 00:37:01,728
Which press are you from?

524
00:37:01,814 --> 00:37:04,507
Huh? What you're talking about?

525
00:37:04,594 --> 00:37:08,071
- From CBC?
- No, I'm not.

526
00:37:10,086 --> 00:37:11,337
<i>OH DAE-OH, CBC REPORTER</i>

527
00:37:14,813 --> 00:37:16,777
Yes, I'm a news reporter.

528
00:37:16,864 --> 00:37:19,141
I was going to tell you eventually,

529
00:37:19,227 --> 00:37:21,295
but I'm not in this for the scoop.

530
00:37:21,382 --> 00:37:22,382
Hold on.

531
00:37:23,433 --> 00:37:24,927
Hey, honey.

532
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:27,638
Okay.

533
00:37:28,576 --> 00:37:31,722
My wife says they won't
confirm the name.

534
00:37:31,809 --> 00:37:32,841
It's got to be a coincidence.

535
00:37:32,865 --> 00:37:34,745
There are so many EODs.

536
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:37,231
You must have a suspect in mind.

537
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:41,906
Tell me, Commander,

538
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:44,269
if you want my help.

539
00:37:44,357 --> 00:37:48,300
This is not something
you can sort out yourself.

540
00:37:48,388 --> 00:37:49,727
Turn off the recorder first.

541
00:37:49,813 --> 00:37:51,273
What?

542
00:37:51,899 --> 00:37:54,923
Oh! I didn't realize.

543
00:37:56,174 --> 00:37:57,547
There. Off. Now, tell me.

544
00:37:57,634 --> 00:37:59,093
- I said turn it off.
- Fine.

545
00:38:02,707 --> 00:38:04,081
Commander...

546
00:38:04,168 --> 00:38:06,601
It's a red light... It's a red light!

547
00:38:08,527 --> 00:38:09,400
Stop, stop, stop!

548
00:38:09,485 --> 00:38:12,197
Brake, brake, brake!

549
00:38:17,688 --> 00:38:20,417
What? The police?

550
00:38:20,503 --> 00:38:23,268
I'm a detective with the Busan Police.

551
00:38:23,354 --> 00:38:25,562
Don't do anything. Just wait for us.

552
00:38:25,647 --> 00:38:27,020
Like I said...

553
00:38:27,108 --> 00:38:28,584
Extend the break time.

554
00:38:28,672 --> 00:38:30,079
And do not blow the whistle.

555
00:38:30,166 --> 00:38:32,199
<i>You've got to tell us what it's about.</i>

556
00:38:32,286 --> 00:38:33,607
We'll be right there.

557
00:38:35,483 --> 00:38:37,517
- Who is it?
- The police.

558
00:38:37,604 --> 00:38:38,838
The police?

559
00:38:38,925 --> 00:38:40,194
Tells me to extend the break.

560
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,636
Why?

561
00:38:44,834 --> 00:38:46,390
Commander Kang's wife is

562
00:38:46,476 --> 00:38:48,239
EOD Jang Yoo-jung.

563
00:38:54,044 --> 00:38:55,939
I need your code for access.

564
00:38:56,025 --> 00:38:57,396
<i>I'll send it to you.</i>

565
00:38:57,483 --> 00:38:59,101
<i>I want your report ASAP.</i>

566
00:38:59,188 --> 00:39:03,463
CPO Jang is at the playground
defusing the bomb.

567
00:39:10,658 --> 00:39:13,318
Go to the playground.
Keep an eye on Jang.

568
00:39:13,404 --> 00:39:14,551
Yes, sir.

569
00:39:19,312 --> 00:39:20,373
Get out of the way.

570
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:21,555
Police. Don't be alarmed.

571
00:39:21,642 --> 00:39:22,719
Where are you going?

572
00:39:27,028 --> 00:39:28,228
Hello.

573
00:39:28,315 --> 00:39:30,383
- There's a bomb in the pool.
- What?

574
00:39:30,469 --> 00:39:32,468
How long will it take
to clear out the pool?

575
00:39:32,555 --> 00:39:33,965
What are you saying?

576
00:39:34,052 --> 00:39:35,052
Do not blow the whistle

577
00:39:35,102 --> 00:39:36,587
under any circumstances.

578
00:39:40,549 --> 00:39:41,974
What is it?

579
00:39:44,164 --> 00:39:45,520
<i>I just sent a picture.</i>

580
00:39:50,872 --> 00:39:53,062
What...

581
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,824
<i>Commander, think back to the
most painful day of your life.</i>

582
00:39:59,352 --> 00:40:00,603
That day is today.

583
00:40:06,999 --> 00:40:08,130
Look for an old black Starex.

584
00:40:08,154 --> 00:40:09,346
It's in the vicinity.

585
00:40:09,432 --> 00:40:10,961
Do not open the door.

586
00:40:11,622 --> 00:40:13,567
I'll find her. Don't worry.

587
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:22,484
<i>You're not the only
Jang Yoo-jung in Korea.</i>

588
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:23,650
<i>This must be a coincidence.</i>

589
00:40:23,717 --> 00:40:24,717
<i>You've got to be careful</i>

590
00:40:24,758 --> 00:40:27,784
<i>with personal information.</i>

591
00:40:28,096 --> 00:40:29,478
<i>I have to be home early today.</i>

592
00:40:29,565 --> 00:40:31,468
<i>Let's focus.</i>

593
00:40:38,281 --> 00:40:40,487
<i>The timer just switched on.</i>

594
00:40:40,575 --> 00:40:42,503
<i>30 minutes.</i>

595
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:44,154
Okay.

596
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,178
Let's do this.

597
00:40:48,638 --> 00:40:53,121
<i>TO CPO JANG YOO-JUNG</i>

598
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,792
There's a pressure sensor on the pole.

599
00:41:39,314 --> 00:41:40,599
I can't get it off.

600
00:41:42,059 --> 00:41:45,324
It looks like it's triggered
by a decibel meter.

601
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:46,410
What's in the bag?

602
00:41:46,438 --> 00:41:48,908
I'd estimate 20 pounds of explosives.

603
00:41:48,994 --> 00:41:50,474
20 pounds?

604
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,346
It's too close to the residence.

605
00:41:54,433 --> 00:41:56,067
Let's defuse it here.

606
00:41:57,005 --> 00:41:58,117
Get started.

607
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:03,226
Be gentle.

608
00:42:18,658 --> 00:42:22,945
<i>Looks like the right one is
tucked behind the board.</i>

609
00:42:22,969 --> 00:42:25,992
Okay... I'll loosen screw no. 2.

610
00:42:28,147 --> 00:42:29,448
Do we have the X-ray?

611
00:42:29,535 --> 00:42:31,032
Not yet.

612
00:42:32,562 --> 00:42:33,726
Stop! Don't remove the board.

613
00:42:33,812 --> 00:42:35,846
What? Why?

614
00:42:35,933 --> 00:42:38,940
The board is connected
to a decoy cable.

615
00:42:39,025 --> 00:42:40,817
We still have time.

616
00:42:40,903 --> 00:42:42,815
<i>Let's try around the back.</i>

617
00:43:06,693 --> 00:43:09,404
That man on the second
floor. Stop the noise.

618
00:43:10,272 --> 00:43:12,010
The countdown just dropped.
Seven minutes.

619
00:43:12,873 --> 00:43:13,801
Jang!

620
00:43:13,886 --> 00:43:16,086
<i>The time is dropping by half
every time there's a noise.</i>

621
00:43:16,111 --> 00:43:19,205
<i>Yoo-jung, this bomb
might be targeted at you.</i>

622
00:43:23,792 --> 00:43:25,514
It's not going to work.
Get out, Yoo-jung.

623
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,980
If this blows up, that man will die.

624
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:28,277
Let me try.

625
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:32,969
I've got to catch it.
Come on, come on...

626
00:43:34,219 --> 00:43:35,332
Damn it.

627
00:43:37,105 --> 00:43:38,600
We infiltrated the second floor.

628
00:43:39,399 --> 00:43:41,345
Sir! Open this door!

629
00:44:01,018 --> 00:44:02,181
Hello.

630
00:44:02,269 --> 00:44:03,815
You just got a call, right?

631
00:44:03,903 --> 00:44:05,623
Sure.

632
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:07,188
The problem's taken care of.

633
00:44:07,274 --> 00:44:09,169
You can use the pool again.

634
00:44:09,255 --> 00:44:11,880
Hello?

635
00:44:11,966 --> 00:44:13,340
Are they kidding me?

636
00:44:13,426 --> 00:44:15,337
- Give me your mask.
- Here.

637
00:44:16,867 --> 00:44:18,709
Don't blow!

638
00:44:38,764 --> 00:44:41,649
Sul-young, Mom's coming home.

639
00:44:43,977 --> 00:44:47,053
God, it's my daughter's birthday.

640
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:48,982
You can't do this to me today.

641
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,453
<i>30 seconds.</i>

642
00:45:26,242 --> 00:45:29,927
<i>We don't see anyone on the second
floor. Just get out of there.</i>

643
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,268
<i>Get out when it hits 15.</i>

644
00:45:59,053 --> 00:46:00,078
Get out of there.

645
00:46:00,165 --> 00:46:02,875
<i>- Four seconds! Get out!
- Get out, Yoo-jung.</i>

646
00:46:08,888 --> 00:46:10,626
<i>Please!</i>

647
00:46:27,866 --> 00:46:29,830
<i>You okay, ma'am?</i>

648
00:46:29,916 --> 00:46:32,176
<i>CPO Jang!</i>

649
00:46:36,903 --> 00:46:38,415
Jang Yoo-jung.

650
00:46:38,501 --> 00:46:40,831
It's a fake.

651
00:46:47,642 --> 00:46:50,318
Scared the hell out of me.

652
00:46:51,291 --> 00:46:53,865
I would throw her in the stockade.

653
00:46:57,896 --> 00:47:00,398
That hardhead.

654
00:47:01,545 --> 00:47:02,554
Don't come!

655
00:47:05,265 --> 00:47:07,229
The situation isn't over yet.

656
00:47:07,316 --> 00:47:08,531
Do not approach.

657
00:47:12,494 --> 00:47:13,989
Where's my daughter?

658
00:47:15,553 --> 00:47:17,899
Hello? Is that you, Do-young?

659
00:47:17,986 --> 00:47:20,471
Yoo-jung? It's me.

660
00:47:20,557 --> 00:47:21,948
What's this picture?

661
00:47:23,478 --> 00:47:25,719
What's Sul-young doing in this picture?

662
00:47:25,806 --> 00:47:27,926
<i>Why are you on this call?</i>

663
00:47:28,587 --> 00:47:30,707
Walk away from the bomb now.

664
00:47:31,194 --> 00:47:32,879
Where is Sul-young?

665
00:47:32,966 --> 00:47:36,303
<i>You should watch your
loved one die, too.</i>

666
00:47:37,623 --> 00:47:39,170
Do-young? Hello?

667
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:40,414
<i>Torpedoes no. 3 and no. 4 misfired.</i>

668
00:47:40,438 --> 00:47:41,777
<i>Torpedo no. 5, launch.</i>

669
00:47:41,863 --> 00:47:43,341
Get out of there, Yoo-jung.

670
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:46,799
<i>Direction, zero degrees.
Distance, three meters.</i>

671
00:47:50,274 --> 00:47:51,978
You've got to get out of there!

672
00:47:54,272 --> 00:47:55,552
<i>If you walk, Sul-young will die.</i>

673
00:47:56,863 --> 00:47:57,778
Don't listen to him.

674
00:47:57,864 --> 00:48:00,041
Get out of there now.

675
00:48:05,603 --> 00:48:08,679
<i>If you walk, your daughter will die.</i>

676
00:48:08,766 --> 00:48:09,878
<i>What do you choose?</i>

677
00:48:12,798 --> 00:48:14,240
<i>You decide, Commander.</i>

678
00:48:14,326 --> 00:48:15,926
No! Get out of there.

679
00:48:17,212 --> 00:48:19,400
<i>Yoo-jung.</i>

680
00:48:21,661 --> 00:48:24,719
Commander Kang, save Sul-young.

681
00:48:26,979 --> 00:48:28,785
No! Get out, Yoo-jung!

682
00:48:29,863 --> 00:48:32,418
Blow it up, you jerk.

683
00:48:32,504 --> 00:48:33,895
Yoo-jung!

684
00:49:24,709 --> 00:49:26,464
Are you listening?

685
00:49:26,552 --> 00:49:27,958
Don't hide.

686
00:49:28,046 --> 00:49:30,618
<i>I told you not to bring
any others into this.</i>

687
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:51,507
Sul-young?

688
00:49:52,341 --> 00:49:54,531
Sul-young. Are you in there?

689
00:49:55,122 --> 00:49:57,520
Sul-young.

690
00:50:13,925 --> 00:50:15,141
Don't open the door!

691
00:50:53,027 --> 00:50:55,633
Sul...

692
00:51:08,737 --> 00:51:09,850
Let's go.

693
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:12,213
I can't.

694
00:51:13,081 --> 00:51:14,873
You're on your own.

695
00:51:14,959 --> 00:51:16,975
I should go home.

696
00:51:18,609 --> 00:51:20,016
Your name's Oh Dae-oh, right?

697
00:51:20,103 --> 00:51:21,823
Yeah. It means fifty-fifty

698
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:24,360
because my dad

699
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:27,698
wanted me to always
take the middle ground.

700
00:51:27,784 --> 00:51:29,661
I'm sorry I was out of place today.

701
00:51:30,321 --> 00:51:32,998
Help me. I can't do this without you.

702
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:40,297
My ear's ringing...

703
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:43,877
Wait up.

704
00:51:46,066 --> 00:51:47,665
Goddamn professionalism.

705
00:51:53,887 --> 00:51:55,294
<i>This is CPO Jang Yoo-jung's phone.</i>

706
00:51:55,381 --> 00:51:57,519
This is Kang. Where is she?

707
00:51:57,606 --> 00:51:59,361
She's in the hospital.

708
00:51:59,447 --> 00:52:00,580
<i>Thankfully, there was no shrapnel.</i>

709
00:52:00,604 --> 00:52:01,828
<i>She'll live.</i>

710
00:52:01,915 --> 00:52:04,783
When she wakes up, tell
her I saved Sul-young.

711
00:52:04,869 --> 00:52:06,365
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

712
00:52:07,442 --> 00:52:09,666
Thank God for that.

713
00:52:11,091 --> 00:52:12,318
There were pictures of the crewmen.

714
00:52:12,342 --> 00:52:13,570
The bomber's got to
be an ex-serviceman.

715
00:52:13,594 --> 00:52:15,401
You have a suspect in mind, right?

716
00:52:18,286 --> 00:52:21,275
Why won't you tell me?

717
00:52:22,978 --> 00:52:25,218
He's too close to you, and
you don't want to suspect him.

718
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:28,470
There are many people
whose lives I've ruined.

719
00:52:29,443 --> 00:52:30,903
So? Who is it?

720
00:52:33,648 --> 00:52:34,969
We're on our way there.

721
00:52:35,316 --> 00:52:36,498

00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:38,862
Pardon?

724
00:52:42,581 --> 00:52:45,431
Sir, the playground bomb went off.

725
00:52:48,455 --> 00:52:49,932
What about Jang?

726
00:52:50,019 --> 00:52:51,617
They don't know yet.

727
00:52:52,695 --> 00:52:54,329
What do we do?

728
00:52:56,588 --> 00:52:58,325
The perp wanted Jang dead.

729
00:52:59,195 --> 00:53:00,510
But she's alive,

730
00:53:00,597 --> 00:53:02,010
so he must be pissed.

731
00:53:03,297 --> 00:53:05,069
What should we do, then?

732
00:53:08,927 --> 00:53:10,283
I'll drive to the hospital.

733
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,232

<i>on TV with his family.</i>

737
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,427
Maybe he was happy to be alive.

738
00:53:53,658 --> 00:53:56,388
I loved that smile.

739
00:53:56,475 --> 00:53:58,212
All of us did.

740
00:54:02,904 --> 00:54:04,191
But watching that face...

741
00:54:20,005 --> 00:54:25,584
I mean, after sinking 22 of his men

742
00:54:25,671 --> 00:54:29,459
to the bottom of the ocean forever.

743
00:54:37,382 --> 00:54:39,277
Putting up memorials and flowers

744
00:54:39,365 --> 00:54:41,693
doesn't change anything.

745
00:54:43,744 --> 00:54:45,813
Even if they pull the
wreck back up now,

746
00:54:45,899 --> 00:54:47,237
it's too late.

747
00:54:47,324 --> 00:54:50,643
Damn it! Damn it!

748
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:53,493
They'll still be lost to the sea.

749

<i>What you should be doing</i>

750
00:54:56,048 --> 00:54:59,088
<i>is not making that scumbag Kang a hero</i>

751
00:54:59,176 --> 00:55:02,426
<i>but putting handcuffs on
him and throwing him in jail.</i>

752
00:55:02,513 --> 00:55:04,702
<i>Even that's too generous.</i>

753
00:55:05,154 --> 00:55:07,275
<i>At least there...</i>

754
00:55:15,547 --> 00:55:21,021
Nobody knows. Nobody knows.

755
00:55:21,107 --> 00:55:23,231
So I've got to do it.

756
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:26,583
I have to do this.

757
00:55:26,669 --> 00:55:28,875
I've got to step up and avenge them.

758
00:55:28,963 --> 00:55:32,595
For poor Tae-ryong

759
00:55:32,681 --> 00:55:39,095
and every single one
of the fallen crewmen.

760
00:55:39,182 --> 00:55:41,163
I will avenge them.

761
00:55:43,561 --> 00:55:48,775
Sorry.

762
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:52,945
I'm so sorry...

763
00:55:57,741 --> 00:55:59,410
That was exhausting.

764
00:56:00,174 --> 00:56:03,250
I wonder how it came out.

765
00:56:03,337 --> 00:56:09,246
That's about how it went down, sir.

766
00:56:16,928 --> 00:56:19,621
- Wake up, Roh.
- Sir...

767
00:56:19,708 --> 00:56:21,672
You said Tae-ryong was here.

768
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:25,200
Yeah, he's stayed here.

769
00:56:26,242 --> 00:56:28,728
Wasn't it Tae-sung, not Tae-ryong?

770
00:56:28,815 --> 00:56:33,159
He wanted me to call him Tae-ryong.

771
00:56:35,522 --> 00:56:36,948
Where is he?

772
00:56:47,062 --> 00:56:48,227
It stinks in here.

773
00:56:48,312 --> 00:56:50,503
What's all this?

774
00:56:51,789 --> 00:56:53,144
What the...

775
00:57:02,667 --> 00:57:05,726
What are these?

776
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:21,819
Ball bearings.

777
00:57:30,542 --> 00:57:31,638
<i>It wasn't an enemy torpedo</i>

778
00:57:31,724 --> 00:57:34,210
that sank the ROKS Halla.

779
00:57:34,297 --> 00:57:35,577
You knew about this, didn't you?

780
00:57:36,521 --> 00:57:40,327
What are you doing, Tae-sung?

781
00:57:40,413 --> 00:57:42,603
Why didn't you make a formal complaint?

782
00:57:48,825 --> 00:57:51,014
It was for yourself.

783
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:55,412
It was the wrong call.

784
00:57:55,497 --> 00:57:57,080
I'll put it right, Tae-sung.

785
00:57:57,166 --> 00:57:58,452
Let's talk face-to-face.

786
00:58:00,538 --> 00:58:03,406
I didn't resent you.

787
00:58:03,493 --> 00:58:07,854
You wiped their tombstones,

788
00:58:07,941 --> 00:58:10,739
but you couldn't wipe away your guilt.

789
00:58:10,826 --> 00:58:12,962
Not for a man of conscience like you.

790
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:15,865
If you want to meet me,
come to the East Hotel.

791
00:58:23,026 --> 00:58:24,538
He wants to meet?

792
00:58:24,624 --> 00:58:26,605
What's happening?

793
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:34,634
You know I spared your life.

794
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:43,567
But that torpedo was ours.

<i>You're right,</i>

<i>but only Kang knows about that.</i>

797
00:58:49,093 --> 00:58:51,996
You knew Kang wasn't the bomber.

798
00:58:52,083 --> 00:58:54,307
<i>Catch Kang as quietly as possible</i>

799
00:58:54,393 --> 00:58:56,132
<i>and tie him into it.</i>

800
00:58:56,218 --> 00:58:58,183
<i>Knowing everything, why did you do it?</i>

801
00:58:58,269 --> 00:59:01,709
<i>That's how our job works.</i>

802
00:59:07,237 --> 00:59:08,957
Call security

803
00:59:09,044 --> 00:59:10,625

804
00:59:10,712 --> 00:59:12,346
Yes, sir.

- Sorry?
<i>- He looks familiar?</i>

813
01:00:12,023 --> 01:00:13,344
Sure does.

01:01:45,624 --> 01:01:48,891
It's Sul-young.

818
01:01:58,102 --> 01:02:00,205
What is this?

819
01:02:00,292 --> 01:02:02,604
My daughter's been kidnapped.

I will reveal everything later.

01:02:30,252 --> 01:02:31,816
Where should I go?

830
01:02:41,409 --> 01:02:43,620
- Set to channel two.
- Okay.

831
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:47,474
I'll go up from here. You, top down.

832
01:02:47,561 --> 01:02:48,847
Okay.

833
01:02:51,141 --> 01:02:53,488
Kang says he'll come clean.

834
01:02:53,574 --> 01:02:56,233
So bring him in now!

835
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:59,049
What's that got to do
with bringing him in?

836
01:02:59,135 --> 01:03:00,204
If you let him talk,

837
01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:01,934
that'll be the end of us.

838
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:02,941
<i>All of us!</i>

839
01:03:03,028 --> 01:03:04,818
You knew all along

840
01:03:04,904 --> 01:03:06,486
that Jeon was trouble.

841
01:03:06,573 --> 01:03:09,731
I didn't think he'd go this far.

842
01:03:09,818 --> 01:03:10,704
If you had done something,

843
01:03:10,791 --> 01:03:12,951
none of this would have happened!

844
01:03:13,038 --> 01:03:16,496
<i>Two of my men got killed, you idiot!</i>

845
01:03:16,583 --> 01:03:18,981
How dare you...

846
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:13,811
Wow. He put work into this.

847
01:04:13,897 --> 01:04:15,340
This is a multicore chip.

848
01:04:15,427 --> 01:04:17,599
Satellite chips, counters...

849
01:04:17,686 --> 01:04:19,441
The two bombs are connected.

850
01:04:19,528 --> 01:04:21,439
What do you make of this?

851
01:04:33,813 --> 01:04:38,627
What's all this on the wall?

852
01:04:38,714 --> 01:04:40,366
It's pretty.

853
01:04:40,452 --> 01:04:41,946
What is this?

854
01:04:42,537 --> 01:04:45,978
Is it a real plant?

855
01:04:47,090 --> 01:04:49,175
Who are you?

856
01:04:50,983 --> 01:04:53,191
I'm here for...

857
01:04:53,277 --> 01:04:55,259
some bread.

858
01:04:59,638 --> 01:05:01,324
You see this gauge?

859
01:05:01,411 --> 01:05:02,297
Yeah.

860
01:05:02,383 --> 01:05:04,202
If the needle passes the
red line, this will blow up.

861
01:05:04,226 --> 01:05:05,286
What?

862
01:05:05,373 --> 01:05:07,615
It'll blow up if you move and
if there's too much noise.

863
01:05:07,701 --> 01:05:09,021
Do you want to press that button?

864
01:05:11,003 --> 01:05:12,741
It's activated now.

865
01:05:16,494 --> 01:05:17,815
Hey!

866
01:05:22,265 --> 01:05:23,967
Hey...

867
01:05:27,756 --> 01:05:29,702
Go away... Please.

868
01:05:31,822 --> 01:05:33,856
Don't tell me what to do.

869
01:05:33,943 --> 01:05:36,011
- Do I know you?
- Go where?

870
01:05:36,097 --> 01:05:38,027
- Order 27! Your latte...
- Shush!

871
01:05:38,114 --> 01:05:41,972
- It's ready.
- Shh.

872
01:05:54,415 --> 01:05:55,944
Get down.

873
01:05:59,941 --> 01:06:01,071
What is he doing?

874
01:06:01,158 --> 01:06:03,660
Let's go around him.

875
01:06:16,033 --> 01:06:17,528
He fooled me.

876
01:06:19,127 --> 01:06:20,412
That prick.

877
01:07:02,955 --> 01:07:06,292
<i>2021 NAVY DEFENSE INDUSTRY FORUM</i>

878
01:07:11,471 --> 01:07:13,887
Just take care of Kang. Let
Team Alpha handle the situation.

879
01:07:13,973 --> 01:07:15,659
Starting in five minutes, Minister.

880
01:07:15,746 --> 01:07:17,171
Shall we?

881
01:07:18,110 --> 01:07:19,865
Okay, let's go.

882
01:07:19,951 --> 01:07:21,724
Let's go.

883
01:07:31,665 --> 01:07:34,324
- Hello?
<i>- It's a specific type of bomb.</i>

884
01:07:34,410 --> 01:07:36,044
There's an intention behind it.

885
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:38,875
The vest is equipped with

886
01:07:38,962 --> 01:07:40,284
a location-tracking chip.

887
01:07:42,578 --> 01:07:45,411
He made at least two of these vests

888
01:07:45,498 --> 01:07:46,871
and connected them

889
01:07:46,957 --> 01:07:48,992
using a distance sensor.

890
01:07:49,078 --> 01:07:50,285
If one gets too far away

891
01:07:50,371 --> 01:07:52,258
from the other,

892
01:07:52,345 --> 01:07:53,788
they'll both blow up.

893
01:07:53,875 --> 01:07:54,935
How do you disarm it?

894
01:07:55,022 --> 01:07:58,480
They'll disarm automatically

895
01:07:58,567 --> 01:08:00,315
once they get within
one meter of each other.

896
01:08:00,339 --> 01:08:02,303
I'm at the Defense Industry Forum.

897
01:08:02,389 --> 01:08:03,953
The VIP seats are empty.

898
01:08:05,796 --> 01:08:08,177
They're probably evacuating the VIPs.

899
01:08:08,264 --> 01:08:11,270
<i>Jeon compared himself to a torpedo.</i>

900
01:08:11,357 --> 01:08:14,242
Torpedoes can do prediction-based
preemptive strikes.

901
01:08:16,779 --> 01:08:17,950
I found Sul-young.

902
01:08:18,036 --> 01:08:19,768
<i>We're at a café across the road.</i>

903
01:08:24,009 --> 01:08:25,868
She looks unhurt.

904
01:08:25,955 --> 01:08:27,398
But she's wearing a bomb vest.

905
01:08:27,484 --> 01:08:29,570
It's wired so that she can't move.

906
01:08:30,125 --> 01:08:32,646
<i>I'll stay with her.</i>

907

<i>Just come quick.</i>

908
01:09:14,093 --> 01:09:15,988
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

909
01:09:16,075 --> 01:09:18,577
<i>I'm Jeon Tae-sung, the Weapons
Officer on ROKS Halla.</i>

910
01:09:22,713 --> 01:09:24,642
A year ago today,

911
01:09:24,729 --> 01:09:26,867
we lost 22 of our brothers

912
01:09:26,953 --> 01:09:30,690
in the cold ocean.

913
01:09:30,777 --> 01:09:33,297
That was the military executives

914
01:09:33,384 --> 01:09:34,913
who abandoned you again.

915
01:09:45,027 --> 01:09:46,401
Take a seat.

916
01:09:46,487 --> 01:09:48,173
The exit is wired with explosives.

917
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:49,303
Jeon Tae-sung!

918
01:10:06,959 --> 01:10:08,749
It's been a long day, right?

919
01:10:08,836 --> 01:10:10,887
It'll all be over soon.

920
01:10:15,822 --> 01:10:17,664
Let's get the people out.

921
01:10:18,394 --> 01:10:20,497
Don't worry about them.

922
01:10:20,584 --> 01:10:22,461
Worry about your daughter.

923
01:10:23,259 --> 01:10:26,822
This vest is connected
to Sul-young's vest.

924
01:10:26,909 --> 01:10:31,202
If I blow up, she goes, too.

925
01:10:31,288 --> 01:10:33,756
Cut it out. This is between you and me.

926
01:10:34,869 --> 01:10:37,857
Sir, this is all a dream.

927
01:10:40,083 --> 01:10:42,585
Merely a nitrogen narcosis.

928
01:10:44,948 --> 01:10:47,173
That means... I can do
whatever the hell I want!

929
01:10:54,089 --> 01:10:55,845
Come out.

930
01:10:55,932 --> 01:10:58,156
Come out of there,
Tae-sung. I'll help you.

931
01:10:59,928 --> 01:11:02,882
Commander, can you smell this?

932
01:11:04,134 --> 01:11:08,757
This awful dampness and stale air.

933
01:11:11,085 --> 01:11:12,207
Don't you see?

934
01:11:12,294 --> 01:11:13,518
We're still underwater.

935
01:11:16,716 --> 01:11:18,212
I'm sorry.

936
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:20,488
I'm responsible, Tae-sung.

937
01:11:20,574 --> 01:11:21,825
I'll take responsibility.

938
01:11:24,536 --> 01:11:27,490
Responsibility. Responsibility...

939
01:11:34,095 --> 01:11:36,249
No one spoke about
what happened that day.

940
01:11:37,744 --> 01:11:39,761
No one told the truth.

941
01:11:39,847 --> 01:11:41,463
Not a single soul!

942
01:11:43,166 --> 01:11:44,366
I don't care about the cowards

943
01:11:44,439 --> 01:11:45,651
who hid in shame.

944
01:11:45,738 --> 01:11:47,823
Except!

945
01:11:48,345 --> 01:11:53,054
Kang Do-young and Kim Yu-taek

946
01:11:53,141 --> 01:11:54,671
used the deceased.

947
01:11:58,216 --> 01:11:59,641
Tae-sung.

948
01:12:03,012 --> 01:12:07,530
Tae-ryong is still underwater.

949
01:12:22,198 --> 01:12:25,918
<i>11 DAYS AFTER SINKING</i>

950
01:12:34,015 --> 01:12:38,378
We shot up a distress
signal 11 days ago.

951
01:12:38,464 --> 01:12:40,341
Why did it take them so long?

952
01:12:42,218 --> 01:12:44,269
It's probably the typhoon.

953
01:12:44,755 --> 01:12:46,295
Fortunately, they fixed the comms buoy.

954
01:12:46,319 --> 01:12:48,300
Command will act on it.

955
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:56,469
Commander Kang must have a plan, right?

956
01:12:59,110 --> 01:13:01,179
Of course, man.

957
01:13:01,265 --> 01:13:02,679
He's no God.

958
01:13:02,766 --> 01:13:05,505
He can't create oxygen.

959
01:13:06,756 --> 01:13:09,520
Worse still, what about the CO2?

960
01:13:09,607 --> 01:13:11,328
Write your last testament.

961
01:13:11,414 --> 01:13:13,447
Dying slowly is the worst.

962
01:13:13,534 --> 01:13:16,072
We would've been better
off hit by the torpedo.

963
01:13:18,643 --> 01:13:20,494
Kim! If we had gotten hit,

964
01:13:20,581 --> 01:13:21,980
we'd all be dead now.

965
01:13:22,988 --> 01:13:24,327
Commander saved us once,

966
01:13:24,414 --> 01:13:26,046
and he'll save us again.

967
01:13:42,591 --> 01:13:43,947
An emergency message has arrived.

968

<i>ESTIMATED TIME TO RESCUE:
15 DAYS MINIMUM</i>

969
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:52,671
15 days? Sir...

970
01:13:55,486 --> 01:13:56,738
What's the atmosphere status?

971
01:13:58,996 --> 01:14:01,811
Oxygen 19 percent, CO2 4 percent.

972
01:14:08,416 --> 01:14:10,188
Are you sure the torpedo's ours?

973
01:14:10,987 --> 01:14:13,820
Yes, it appears to be a K-201

974
01:14:13,907 --> 01:14:15,575
that got lost during a test.

975
01:14:17,592 --> 01:14:19,190
They're all going to die, then?

976
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:22,996
We ran several scenarios,

977
01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:24,647
but survival is impossible.

978
01:14:25,864 --> 01:14:28,332
The US is of the same opinion.

979
01:14:31,147 --> 01:14:34,135
Not one man?

980
01:14:35,074 --> 01:14:36,673
No, sir.

981
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:43,590
Bury it, then.

982
01:14:47,482 --> 01:14:51,358
Nobody can know the torpedo was ours.

983
01:14:51,444 --> 01:14:54,764
Keeping CO2 and oxygen
regulation at the minimum,

984
01:14:54,851 --> 01:14:57,997
we'll last six days at most.

985
01:14:58,083 --> 01:15:00,812
Even if they reach us in 14 days,

986
01:15:00,899 --> 01:15:02,880
that leaves seven days with no oxygen.

987
01:15:08,372 --> 01:15:10,457
What's the best we can do?

988
01:15:11,430 --> 01:15:14,002
An urgent message from Halla, sir.

989
01:15:21,683 --> 01:15:25,993
I can't make the call
sitting in this room.

990
01:15:28,009 --> 01:15:31,033
Commander Kang will know best.

991
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:35,134
Any objections?

992
01:15:38,888 --> 01:15:40,660
Burn the file.

993
01:15:41,113 --> 01:15:43,633
We have no other choice.

994
01:15:43,719 --> 01:15:46,830
No one can give such an order.

995
01:15:46,916 --> 01:15:48,225
We can't all live.

996
01:15:48,312 --> 01:15:49,576
Should we all die, then?

997
01:15:49,663 --> 01:15:50,890
We've obtained approval
from the top brass.

998
01:15:50,914 --> 01:15:51,800
Who made that call?

999
01:15:51,887 --> 01:15:53,357
We've got to save even
one man if we can.

1000
01:15:53,381 --> 01:15:54,290
Whose life?

1001
01:15:54,377 --> 01:15:55,937
Who decides that?

1002
01:15:56,023 --> 01:15:57,778
Your fellow men could
die because of you.

1003
01:15:57,865 --> 01:15:59,968
We've got to save whoever we can!

1004
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:01,949
- It's unacceptable.
- You punk!

1005
01:16:02,036 --> 01:16:03,722
- Stop! Please.
- Goddammit!

1006
01:16:03,808 --> 01:16:05,703
Please stop! I object, too.

1007
01:16:05,789 --> 01:16:06,725
We've just lost another life,

1008
01:16:06,810 --> 01:16:08,032
squabbling like this.

1009
01:16:08,119 --> 01:16:12,776
Isn't one survivor better than none?

1010
01:16:14,062 --> 01:16:16,513
Commander, no. This isn't right.

1011
01:16:16,599 --> 01:16:18,007
Let's be sensible.

1012
01:16:18,093 --> 01:16:19,502
Sensible? With human life?

1013
01:16:19,589 --> 01:16:20,589
Should we all die, then?

1014
01:16:20,644 --> 01:16:21,900
Think about it.

1015
01:16:21,987 --> 01:16:25,306
Your brother Tae-ryong
could get out alive.

1016
01:16:25,392 --> 01:16:26,731
You mean yourself?

1017
01:16:26,818 --> 01:16:28,191
Come on, man. Please!

1018
01:16:28,278 --> 01:16:30,728
- You punk!
- Stop, just stop.

1019
01:16:30,814 --> 01:16:31,979
How do we choose who?

1020
01:16:32,066 --> 01:16:34,482
We've got to decide that.

1021
01:16:34,568 --> 01:16:36,150
Who here wants to die?

1022
01:16:36,237 --> 01:16:39,922
Enough!

1023
01:16:44,614 --> 01:16:46,316
Stop.

1024
01:16:58,412 --> 01:17:00,515
<i>This is your Commander speaking.</i>

1025
01:17:00,602 --> 01:17:02,583
<i>Thank you all for holding out thus far.</i>

1026
01:17:04,598 --> 01:17:07,953
<i>We have a storm above us.</i>

1027
01:17:08,039 --> 01:17:10,038
<i>Once it's over,</i>

1028
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:12,731
<i>it will take at least 14 days
for the rescue to arrive,</i>

1029
01:17:13,705 --> 01:17:16,121
<i>provided the sea stays calm</i>

1030
01:17:16,208 --> 01:17:19,562
<i>and the rescue team works</i>

1031
01:17:19,649 --> 01:17:23,367
<i>around the clock.</i>

1032
01:17:26,078 --> 01:17:27,967
<i>The CO2 removal</i>

1033
01:17:28,708 --> 01:17:29,919
<i>and oxygen generation capacity</i>

1034
01:17:30,006 --> 01:17:32,805
<i>gives us four days,</i>

1035
01:17:32,891 --> 01:17:37,566
<i>six days at the most.</i>

1036
01:17:37,652 --> 01:17:39,732
<i>I don't need to tell you
what will happen after that.</i>

1037
01:17:41,927 --> 01:17:46,098
<i>My goal is to save as
many of us as possible.</i>

1038
01:17:47,454 --> 01:17:49,922
<i>But it's looking like that's
not going to be everyone.</i>

1039
01:17:54,892 --> 01:17:57,534
<i>If we can save half of us,</i>

1040
01:17:59,132 --> 01:18:03,495
<i>or if that's not possible,
half of half,</i>

1041
01:18:03,581 --> 01:18:08,065
or even just one man?

1042
01:18:09,629 --> 01:18:11,159
I think that's the way to go.

1043
01:18:14,738 --> 01:18:17,780
We'll have to decide whether
half of us live full lives

1044
01:18:17,866 --> 01:18:19,952
or all of us last six more
days and die together.

1045
01:18:22,871 --> 01:18:24,540
I can't make that decision for you.

1046
01:18:26,521 --> 01:18:28,606
We'll put it to a vote.

1047
01:18:40,042 --> 01:18:42,127
What are these blank ballots?

1048
01:18:42,787 --> 01:18:44,838
It means that they support
whatever you decide.

1049
01:18:54,604 --> 01:18:57,837
Four in favor, four against.

1050
01:18:59,192 --> 01:19:00,792
The rest have left their votes to me.

1051
01:19:04,406 --> 01:19:06,248
We're saving half.

1052
01:19:08,438 --> 01:19:09,585
- Wait, sir.
- Tae-sung.

1053
01:19:12,434 --> 01:19:13,825
Don't.

1054
01:19:27,381 --> 01:19:30,908
I have 44 strands of thread.

1055
01:19:30,995 --> 01:19:33,723
Once you've drawn your
thread, you can't change it.

1056
01:19:33,810 --> 01:19:36,609
That's the rule.

1057
01:19:36,695 --> 01:19:39,181
If all the officers draw short threads,

1058
01:19:39,268 --> 01:19:41,179
the most senior crewman
will take command.

1059
01:19:41,979 --> 01:19:43,386
Is that clear?

1060
01:19:43,473 --> 01:19:45,315
Yes, sir.

1061
01:19:47,505 --> 01:19:49,608
Short threads to the stern,

1062
01:19:49,695 --> 01:19:52,336
long threads to the bow!

1063
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:02,605
Next.

1064
01:22:42,715 --> 01:22:43,931
Next.

1065
01:22:50,986 --> 01:22:51,986
Take this.

1066
01:22:52,933 --> 01:22:54,463
Stop it.

1067
01:22:54,949 --> 01:22:55,991
Take it. Come on.

1068
01:22:57,868 --> 01:22:59,468
It's the rule.

1069
01:23:00,162 --> 01:23:02,161
It's okay. Just listen to me.

1070
01:23:02,248 --> 01:23:03,569
Stop it, man.

1071
01:23:04,403 --> 01:23:07,202
Tae-ryong, listen to your brother.

1072
01:23:07,288 --> 01:23:09,078
Stop it.

1073
01:23:09,165 --> 01:23:11,164
- Take it. It's okay.
- I said don't.

1074
01:23:11,250 --> 01:23:12,995
Take the thread, dammit.

1075
01:23:13,081 --> 01:23:14,656
I said stop!

1076
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:21,295
What's going on?

1077
01:23:22,337 --> 01:23:23,989
You can't change threads.

1078
01:23:24,076 --> 01:23:25,616
This is my right.

1079
01:23:25,702 --> 01:23:27,326
I never agreed to this.

1080
01:23:27,412 --> 01:23:28,924
It's an order.

1081
01:23:29,011 --> 01:23:31,010
Tae-ryong is my brother.

1082
01:23:31,096 --> 01:23:32,903
Just stop it.

1083
01:23:33,599 --> 01:23:38,152
Jeon Tae-sung, it's an order.

1084
01:23:39,472 --> 01:23:42,983
Sailors don't throw their lives away.

1085
01:23:51,429 --> 01:23:52,819
Boys!

1086
01:23:55,426 --> 01:23:59,041
You all know this is wrong.

1087
01:24:00,952 --> 01:24:03,716
I know how you feel. Stop.

1088
01:24:03,803 --> 01:24:05,698
I won't.

1089
01:24:05,784 --> 01:24:08,165
Judging from such a ridiculous order,

1090
01:24:08,251 --> 01:24:11,571
you're not in your right mind.

1091
01:24:11,658 --> 01:24:15,464
I'm relieving you of command.

1092
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:17,671
Lieutenant Kim!

1093
01:24:19,929 --> 01:24:21,320
Place him in custody.

1094
01:24:23,753 --> 01:24:28,150
Boys!

1095
01:24:28,237 --> 01:24:31,834
You all know. You all know!

1096
01:24:31,921 --> 01:24:33,867
Boys!

1097
01:24:36,891 --> 01:24:39,324
Sir, please stop.

1098
01:24:41,236 --> 01:24:43,374
Lieutenant Jeon Tae-sung is

1099
01:24:43,460 --> 01:24:45,911
suspended from duty as of this moment.

1100
01:24:45,997 --> 01:24:47,224
Says who?

1101
01:24:47,312 --> 01:24:49,773
I'm suspending you
from duty, Commander.

1102
01:24:50,898 --> 01:24:52,740
Place him in custody!

1103
01:24:54,235 --> 01:24:55,694
Lock him up.

1104
01:25:01,916 --> 01:25:03,602
Commander!

1105
01:25:03,689 --> 01:25:06,470
Tae-sung!

1106
01:25:06,887 --> 01:25:10,137
I'm sorry, Commander. I apologize.

1107
01:25:10,223 --> 01:25:12,291
Just let me change the thread.

1108
01:25:12,378 --> 01:25:14,082
Let me change it.

1109
01:25:15,124 --> 01:25:19,572
I'm sorry, Commander.
Please let me change it.

1110
01:25:30,278 --> 01:25:32,259
Please, sir.

1111
01:25:39,488 --> 01:25:41,731
We should've all died then and there.

1112
01:25:41,818 --> 01:25:45,814
No, we did all die there.
Tae-ryong and me, too.

1113
01:25:48,525 --> 01:25:49,811
I have only one regret.

1114
01:25:51,236 --> 01:25:55,859
I should've let you change your thread.

1115
01:26:00,795 --> 01:26:02,532
I'm sorry, Tae-sung.

1116
01:26:23,526 --> 01:26:25,055
You know where Sul-young is,

1117
01:26:26,550 --> 01:26:28,496
but don't you want to
know where CPO Jang is?

1118
01:26:30,164 --> 01:26:32,945
She's in a Tucson opposite Sul-young.

1119
01:27:24,142 --> 01:27:25,671
This vest is called the "Fused Tree."

1120
01:27:31,128 --> 01:27:32,658
I'll give you three minutes to decide

1121
01:27:34,430 --> 01:27:37,314
whether to save one or kill both.

1122
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:40,408
You decide.

1123
01:30:33,568 --> 01:30:35,322
Dad's in a café,

1124
01:30:35,408 --> 01:30:36,819
but I can't come now.

1125
01:30:36,905 --> 01:30:39,754
Who are you?

1126
01:30:58,071 --> 01:30:59,114
Kang Do-young!

1127
01:30:59,878 --> 01:31:00,955
What are you doing?

1128
01:31:02,242 --> 01:31:03,667
Just give up.

1129
01:31:36,616 --> 01:31:39,223
- Where's Dad?
- He'll be here soon.

1130
01:31:47,634 --> 01:31:48,712
You can't go there...

1131
01:31:54,621 --> 01:31:56,984
Don't come, Do-young.

1132
01:31:59,591 --> 01:32:00,947
Do-young!

1133
01:32:04,422 --> 01:32:06,108
Where's Sul-young?

1134
01:32:06,195 --> 01:32:07,342
Right there.

1135
01:33:05,803 --> 01:33:07,819
Dad's here. I'm sorry.

1136
01:33:23,529 --> 01:33:25,510
I'm sorry, Sul-young.

1137
01:33:38,057 --> 01:33:39,431
Did you make up with Hye-in?

1138
01:33:39,517 --> 01:33:40,856
Not yet.

1139
01:33:40,943 --> 01:33:42,107
Why not?

1140
01:33:42,194 --> 01:33:43,827
I don't know.

1141
01:33:46,156 --> 01:33:47,807
It's harder than you think, huh?

1142
01:33:47,893 --> 01:33:49,388
No.

1143
01:33:50,848 --> 01:33:52,110
I thought you wanted to make up.

1144
01:33:52,134 --> 01:33:53,768
Yeah.

1145
01:33:58,842 --> 01:34:00,301
Your dad picked this out?

1146
01:34:04,368 --> 01:34:05,932
I miss him.

1147
01:34:25,675 --> 01:34:28,150
I'm here to tell the truth

1148
01:34:28,237 --> 01:34:29,244
behind the sinking

1149
01:34:29,331 --> 01:34:31,861
of the ROKS Halla.

1150
01:34:32,869 --> 01:34:35,077
Due to poor weather conditions,

1151
01:34:35,163 --> 01:34:37,163
it took 20 days for Command
to locate our position.

1152
01:34:37,630 --> 01:34:40,082
Oxygen had almost run out.

1153
01:34:40,168 --> 01:34:42,584
We only had enough for 44 men

1154
01:34:42,671 --> 01:34:44,165
to last seven days

1155
01:34:44,791 --> 01:34:46,268
I thought rescuing 44 corpses

1156
01:34:46,355 --> 01:34:48,197
would be pointless.

1157
01:34:52,611 --> 01:34:54,749
The 22 casualties were the result,

1158
01:34:54,835 --> 01:34:56,608
not of a bulkhead failure

1159
01:35:00,570 --> 01:35:03,577
but of my independent judgment.

1160
01:35:03,664 --> 01:35:05,506
I take full responsibility.

1161
01:35:08,634 --> 01:35:10,129
I'm sorry.

1162
01:35:11,901 --> 01:35:14,021
Who did the lost torpedo belong to?

1163
01:35:14,438 --> 01:35:16,403
It was one of our own.

1164
01:35:16,489 --> 01:35:19,288
How much oxygen was left
when you were rescued?

1165
01:35:19,374 --> 01:35:22,242
Almost none.

1166
01:35:22,328 --> 01:35:24,257
Any comment for the victims' families?

1167
01:35:24,344 --> 01:35:27,263
Couldn't you have saved another life?

1168
01:35:29,419 --> 01:35:33,399
I should've made one more long thread.

1169
01:35:33,485 --> 01:35:35,119
I'm sorry.

1170
01:35:39,567 --> 01:35:42,828
If you were to go back to that time,

1171
01:35:42,915 --> 01:35:44,921
what would you do?

1172
01:36:01,083 --> 01:36:05,496
<i>HERE LIES HWANG YOUNG-WOO</i>

1173
01:36:21,311 --> 01:36:23,292
Am I doing the right thing?

1174
01:36:25,586 --> 01:36:27,150
You mustn't falter.

1175
01:36:30,904 --> 01:36:32,329
Look at them.

1176
01:36:37,820 --> 01:36:41,504
The survivors have it worse.

1177
01:36:43,347 --> 01:36:44,841
It's my turn, sir.

1178
01:36:55,547 --> 01:36:57,458
Not that one.

1179
01:36:58,536 --> 01:37:00,204
I've chosen my fate.

1180
01:37:01,351 --> 01:37:04,792
You should stay, sir.

1181
01:37:05,974 --> 01:37:06,987
If we run low again,

1182
01:37:07,074 --> 01:37:08,807
we have to do this again.

1183
01:37:08,893 --> 01:37:12,230
Young-woo.

1184
01:37:19,355 --> 01:37:22,970
Those with short threads, assemble.

1185
01:37:28,983 --> 01:37:31,642
Commander.

1186
01:37:31,729 --> 01:37:33,884
Brothers.

1187
01:37:35,344 --> 01:37:36,660
Please don't cry.

1188
01:37:36,746 --> 01:37:38,610
We'll go down with honor.

1189
01:37:46,292 --> 01:37:48,464
Hold strong

1190
01:37:48,551 --> 01:37:50,636
for those you leave behind.

1191
01:38:00,369 --> 01:38:01,863
Please make it out alive.

1192
01:38:06,902 --> 01:38:08,616
Let's think again. There's
got to be another way.

1193
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:10,969
No, sir.

1194
01:38:11,873 --> 01:38:13,924
If you break down, we all die.

1195
01:38:20,701 --> 01:38:24,507
Those men...

1196
01:38:24,594 --> 01:38:26,297
You're responsible for them.

1197
01:38:32,206 --> 01:38:33,527
I hear you.

1198
01:38:41,173 --> 01:38:42,563
Attention.

1199
01:39:17,459 --> 01:39:18,745
Ready front.

1200
01:39:25,627 --> 01:39:27,226
Go.

1201
01:41:17,024 --> 01:41:18,239
Attention!

1202
01:41:21,542 --> 01:41:22,932
Salute.

1203
01:42:20,212 --> 01:42:26,885
<i>Decibel</i>

1204
01:42:30,535 --> 01:42:32,047
Where are you going? Come here.

1205
01:42:32,133 --> 01:42:34,149
Let's get a picture together.

1206
01:42:34,497 --> 01:42:38,373
Let's see.

1207
01:42:38,459 --> 01:42:39,745
How do you do this?

1208
01:42:40,857 --> 01:42:46,992
Why are you looking so awkward?

1209
01:42:47,078 --> 01:42:50,641
I don't like taking pictures, sir.

1210
01:42:50,728 --> 01:42:53,283
He loves taking pictures.

1211
01:42:53,370 --> 01:42:55,959
Yeah? Okay.

1212
01:42:56,046 --> 01:42:58,406
By the way, don't call me "sir"

1213
01:42:58,493 --> 01:42:59,852
when we're on our own.

1214
01:42:59,939 --> 01:43:01,104
Just call me bro.

1215
01:43:01,190 --> 01:43:03,675
- Yes, sir.
- On three. Okay?

1216
01:43:03,762 --> 01:43:05,031
- It's nothing.
- One, two...

1217
01:43:05,117 --> 01:43:06,456
Say "bro" on three.

1218
01:43:06,543 --> 01:43:08,437
One, two, three!

1219
01:43:08,524 --> 01:43:10,314
- Bro.
- Bro.

1220
01:43:10,401 --> 01:43:12,504
I have an idea. Get everyone down.

1221
01:43:12,590 --> 01:43:14,206
Bring them in.

1222
01:43:14,293 --> 01:43:15,857
Yes, sir.

1223
01:43:17,700 --> 01:43:20,689
He's becoming more and more like me.

1224
01:43:22,183 --> 01:43:23,580
Let's take one together.

1225
01:43:23,667 --> 01:43:26,215
One, two, three.
