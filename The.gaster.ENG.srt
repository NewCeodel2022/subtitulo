1
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:07,225
Official selection of the Cannes Film Festival

2
00:01:09,309 --> 00:01:11,354
This movie is inspired by a true story.

3
00:01:11,554 --> 00:01:13,473
All names and characters are fictitious.

4
00:02:47,662 --> 00:02:48,704
Curse.

5
00:02:49,765 --> 00:02:52,370
It's night, you should slow down.

6
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:53,974
You're spotting me.

7
00:02:55,789 --> 00:02:56,828
Are you OK?

8
00:02:57,245 --> 00:02:57,871
Yes and you?

9
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,662
Yeah.

10
00:02:59,392 --> 00:03:01,789
You shouldn't drive so fast at night.

11
00:03:02,497 --> 00:03:04,330
Are you taking good photos?

12
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,370
That?

13
00:03:05,954 --> 00:03:07,724
No need for photos.

14
00:03:09,057 --> 00:03:10,316
What are you talking about?

15
00:03:10,516 --> 00:03:12,601
Photos are important for insurance.

16
00:03:12,976 --> 00:03:15,040
So you can't lie about it later.

17
00:03:15,102 --> 00:03:16,143
It's a big dent...

18
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:07,768
The gangster, the policeman, the devil.

19
00:04:09,151 --> 00:04:11,640
August 2005

20
00:04:12,245 --> 00:04:17,850
"Early this morning, another murder took place in the Cheonan district.

21
00:04:18,288 --> 00:04:22,874
Since last year, several murders have taken place,

22
00:04:23,074 --> 00:04:27,661
But the police haven't solved any of the cases yet."

23
00:04:27,953 --> 00:04:30,038
We also want to solve them...

24
00:04:30,787 --> 00:04:31,830
Solve them...

25
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:35,996
...and go on vacation.

26
00:04:40,682 --> 00:04:41,724
Turn off the siren!

27
00:04:42,308 --> 00:04:45,225
Nobody gives a shit.

28
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:49,724
Nobody cares...

29
00:04:50,516 --> 00:04:52,037
It's a fucked up world.

30
00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:52,933
You're right.

31
00:04:55,788 --> 00:04:57,671
Look at those idiots.

32
00:04:57,871 --> 00:05:00,474
What are those idiots doing?

33
00:05:02,246 --> 00:05:04,744
Where are you going? We are on call!

34
00:05:05,369 --> 00:05:06,726
Does it look like we're on duty?

35
00:05:06,926 --> 00:05:07,358
Brother!

36
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:08,600
See you later!

37
00:05:13,288 --> 00:05:14,537
Please come in.

38
00:05:14,746 --> 00:05:16,620
He's a cop, let him through.

39
00:05:16,828 --> 00:05:18,703
I told you don't let me see you again.

40
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:21,830
Block the entrance.

41
00:05:22,871 --> 00:05:23,935
Move to the side.

42
00:05:24,453 --> 00:05:27,245
Why did you come here again?

43
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,203
I don't need a fucking mobster's permission.

44
00:05:32,245 --> 00:05:32,974
Mister.

45
00:05:33,287 --> 00:05:34,121
Mister.

46
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:37,745
Come back later. Today was not a good day.

47
00:05:39,098 --> 00:05:40,579
Today must be a special day.

48
00:05:41,828 --> 00:05:44,537
The roads are blocked, the gangsters are acting...

49
00:05:45,787 --> 00:05:46,829
Good...

50
00:05:50,474 --> 00:05:52,891
Here you go... Now please go.

51
00:05:57,245 --> 00:05:59,600
Motherfucker, who do you think you're talking to?

52
00:06:01,433 --> 00:06:03,934
Fucking jerk.

53
00:06:08,037 --> 00:06:10,682
Damn!

54
00:06:11,641 --> 00:06:13,205
You should have been more careful.

55
00:06:14,205 --> 00:06:18,599
Why are the fucking gangsters trying to block the police?

56
00:06:24,182 --> 00:06:24,912
Keep going.

57
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:26,934
Good luck!

58
00:06:52,516 --> 00:06:53,496
Boss.

59
00:06:58,516 --> 00:06:59,746
That pig is here again.

60
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:03,912
Put it down.

61
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:15,371
Wrap it well and send it.

62
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:22,536
I received a $200 gift certificate.

63
00:07:23,517 --> 00:07:24,765
Less 10%...

64
00:07:26,848 --> 00:07:28,389
180 dollars.

65
00:07:29,474 --> 00:07:31,558
Who the fuck?

66
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:33,371
Open it.

67
00:07:37,098 --> 00:07:37,853
"Hello!"

68
00:07:38,053 --> 00:07:38,809
Greeting?

69
00:07:42,453 --> 00:07:45,142
You have been accused of illegally trading gift cards.

70
00:07:45,806 --> 00:07:47,089
You can shut up or not...

71
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,183
Get a lawyer if you feel like...

72
00:07:50,265 --> 00:07:51,152
I'm going to take you.

73
00:07:51,352 --> 00:07:52,140
Mister!

74
00:07:52,662 --> 00:07:54,182
Please come in for a moment.

75
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:57,036
Get out now.

76
00:07:59,954 --> 00:08:01,463
put them.

77
00:08:05,954 --> 00:08:06,994
Good morning boss!

78
00:08:19,161 --> 00:08:19,953
It's me.

79
00:08:20,787 --> 00:08:22,558
That idiot is back.

80
00:08:22,758 --> 00:08:23,236
That?

81
00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:27,495
I sent it to the crime scene, why the hell is it there?

82
00:08:29,702 --> 00:08:31,786
Ask that bastard yourself.

83
00:08:33,182 --> 00:08:34,537
Tell Sang-do I'm on my way.

84
00:08:36,101 --> 00:08:39,223
I pay you well, you can't keep letting this happen.

85
00:08:40,057 --> 00:08:41,473
Your police keep bothering my men...

86
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,807
...because you take all the money yourself.

87
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:48,683
I told you not to treat in the open.

88
00:08:49,121 --> 00:08:51,412
Or you open a business in someone else's name,

89
00:08:51,558 --> 00:08:54,577
or you deal with the risks of what you are doing.

90
00:08:54,588 --> 00:08:56,932
I don't have time for that shit.

91
00:08:57,015 --> 00:08:59,828
I'm busy keeping the machine running.

92
00:08:59,849 --> 00:09:02,454
You should stop him before he comes.

93
00:09:02,663 --> 00:09:04,538
My boys are just making some side income.

94
00:09:04,738 --> 00:09:07,077
Alright, don't worry about it. I'll take care of him.

95
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,952
That?

96
00:09:20,098 --> 00:09:21,099
"¿Qué?"

97
00:09:21,307 --> 00:09:22,451
Am I your fucking friend?

98
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,285
Where are you?

99
00:09:23,494 --> 00:09:25,453
I'm on my way to the crime scene, bye.

100
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,494
I don't want a friend like you anyway.

101
00:09:29,225 --> 00:09:29,746
Let me turn off the fan.

102
00:09:30,517 --> 00:09:31,662
Come come come!

103
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,370
Park here.

104
00:09:38,683 --> 00:09:39,724
Yes sir.

105
00:09:46,682 --> 00:09:48,555
Thanks for the lift.

106
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,038
Come on brother!

107
00:09:54,555 --> 00:09:57,683
I led you here! Give and take!

108
00:10:00,682 --> 00:10:02,088
Here is your rate.

109
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:06,755
Stay there.

110
00:10:06,955 --> 00:10:07,037
I'm going to report you!

111
00:10:08,286 --> 00:10:09,172
Damn traffic jam.

112
00:10:09,173 --> 00:10:11,671
Where the hell were you?

113
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:13,994
It's already a disaster.

114
00:10:15,058 --> 00:10:16,098
Clean it up.

115
00:10:16,869 --> 00:10:18,182
Everyone, please move to the side.

116
00:10:18,245 --> 00:10:20,222
Sorry, you can take photos later.

117
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,391
Just wait a bit, please.

118
00:10:24,473 --> 00:10:27,181
What are you doing? Close the area properly!

119
00:10:27,932 --> 00:10:29,703
Go away!

120
00:10:30,722 --> 00:10:32,806
You were late anyway.

121
00:10:57,975 --> 00:11:00,681
Hey! More and more people are showing up!

122
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:02,245
Stop the people!

123
00:11:02,349 --> 00:11:03,181
Good job.

124
00:11:03,786 --> 00:11:05,160
Have you verified their identity yet?

125
00:11:05,181 --> 00:11:07,974
We are waiting for the details of your plate. We should know soon.

126
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:17,558
He died just a few hours ago.

127
00:11:18,473 --> 00:11:20,765
Between 3:00 and 5:00 in the morning.

128
00:11:21,412 --> 00:11:23,808
The cause of death was blood loss,

129
00:11:24,008 --> 00:11:26,410
or maybe a heart attack.

130
00:11:26,722 --> 00:11:28,078
It's just my preliminary judgment.

131
00:11:28,495 --> 00:11:30,162
Take some pictures.

132
00:11:46,765 --> 00:11:48,808
No Seo-jin! Here.

133
00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:50,369
Come look at this.

134
00:11:50,766 --> 00:11:54,099
I told you not to call my name while on duty!

135
00:11:54,556 --> 00:11:57,264
Sorry Mrs! Greeting! Now look.

136
00:11:57,389 --> 00:11:58,223
What is it?

137
00:12:00,307 --> 00:12:01,349
Seems like a latecomer.

138
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:07,037
It may be, although it may not be...

139
00:12:08,598 --> 00:12:10,160
Do you think he was killed for this?

140
00:12:11,035 --> 00:12:13,120
I wish that was the case, instead of another random murder.

141
00:12:33,682 --> 00:12:34,830
Hello thank you very much...

142
00:12:35,451 --> 00:12:37,243
...for taking out one of my men.

143
00:12:37,816 --> 00:12:40,161
If you stick to the rules, that doesn't happen.

144
00:12:43,286 --> 00:12:44,014
Anyway...

145
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:48,222
We have separate businesses but the machines are the same.

146
00:12:48,284 --> 00:12:49,223
OK dude.

147
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:53,683
Don't you think we need to resolve our dispute somehow?

148
00:12:53,912 --> 00:12:55,161
For our own good...

149
00:13:00,993 --> 00:13:01,722
Sang-do...

150
00:13:02,056 --> 00:13:03,285
Yes, Dong-soo?

151
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:07,973
If you continue to overeat, your stomach will hurt.

152
00:13:09,266 --> 00:13:11,412
Don't cause trouble.

153
00:13:11,931 --> 00:13:13,994
And take care of your business.

154
00:13:14,265 --> 00:13:16,765
They all have a line.

155
00:13:17,661 --> 00:13:19,119
Cross that line and you die.

156
00:13:23,077 --> 00:13:24,743
It's me? A Kimchi fridge?

157
00:13:26,451 --> 00:13:27,765
As Hiddink said...

158
00:13:28,764 --> 00:13:31,161
"I'm still very hungry."

159
00:13:32,661 --> 00:13:34,536
I am a man of simple means.

160
00:13:35,368 --> 00:13:37,868
So I'm still very hungry.

161
00:13:41,307 --> 00:13:42,119
Mister.

162
00:13:43,006 --> 00:13:43,006
That's why he lets you have your shit.

163
00:13:43,206 --> 00:13:46,201
Can't you see my boss tolerates you because you're his friend?

164
00:13:51,118 --> 00:13:52,680
Casinos.

165
00:13:52,721 --> 00:13:56,550
Bars, clubs, and now you want more? We will not allow it.

166
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,579
Idiot, you must be crazy to talk to my boss like that.

167
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,076
"Allow"? Fuck off.

168
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:05,158
Want to die?

169
00:14:05,784 --> 00:14:06,827
Fool.

170
00:14:07,868 --> 00:14:09,953
I see you taught your boys well...

171
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,598
Look at him, still looking at me.

172
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:14,451
Dong-soo...

173
00:14:16,305 --> 00:14:19,556
You give me breadcrumbs, and you want me to be happy?

174
00:14:23,056 --> 00:14:25,244
So how do you expect him to react?

175
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:35,201
Come here.

176
00:14:36,661 --> 00:14:37,242
Yes Boss.

177
00:14:42,597 --> 00:14:45,368
Acting like this while the bosses are talking...

178
00:14:46,034 --> 00:14:46,514
Come here.

179
00:14:50,828 --> 00:14:52,451
Look at this idiot.

180
00:15:04,016 --> 00:15:05,681
Let's make it up, okay?

181
00:15:14,223 --> 00:15:14,953
Grandma.

182
00:15:22,264 --> 00:15:22,889
Tastes good.

183
00:15:28,348 --> 00:15:30,161
The victim was 46 years old, Choi Jeong-Gu.

184
00:15:30,473 --> 00:15:33,285
It has no history or stains of any kind.

185
00:15:33,806 --> 00:15:34,933
The autopsy report is straightforward.

186
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:36,703
His body had multiple stab wounds.

187
00:15:37,121 --> 00:15:38,493
This boy is a beginner.

188
00:15:38,743 --> 00:15:39,848
He doesn't think at all.

189
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,286
I think it is incorrect to call it a beginner.

190
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:45,265
He left no evidence.

191
00:15:45,369 --> 00:15:48,388
No fingerprints, no footprints, no blood, no hair.

192
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,514
The victim's wallet is missing, so it could have been a robbery.

193
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,640
Although it seems that theft could not be the reason either.

194
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,786
Kill random people? That's not even human.

195
00:15:56,596 --> 00:15:58,286
We are done with the briefing. He calls the captain of the first team.

196
00:15:59,221 --> 00:15:59,847
Yes sir.

197
00:16:04,807 --> 00:16:05,577
Yes Boss?

198
00:16:08,077 --> 00:16:11,202
This case is likely to be robbery and murder.

199
00:16:11,244 --> 00:16:14,430
Find people with similar criminal histories.

200
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,160
Yes sir.

201
00:16:15,786 --> 00:16:17,870
The rest of you back the first team.

202
00:16:19,515 --> 00:16:20,784
All three cases are the same.

203
00:16:21,806 --> 00:16:22,451
Three?

204
00:16:24,847 --> 00:16:26,887
July 15, West Hills Reservoir.

205
00:16:28,703 --> 00:16:32,140
July 23, the sunny beach motel Boryeong.

206
00:16:32,181 --> 00:16:33,951
Just like the case last night.

207
00:16:35,284 --> 00:16:37,471
In all three, the murder weapon is a knife.

208
00:16:37,868 --> 00:16:40,160
When you look at the dimensions of the knife,

209
00:16:41,464 --> 00:16:44,952
is the same in each case.

210
00:16:46,263 --> 00:16:47,660
This is a serial killer.

211
00:16:48,597 --> 00:16:50,015
We are not in the United States.

212
00:16:50,367 --> 00:16:52,867
You can't get guns in Korea, so all the killers use knives.

213
00:16:55,785 --> 00:16:57,932
There are more than 1,000 murders a year.

214
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:00,786
By your logic, the same person is responsible for all of them.

215
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:01,930
You're crazy?

216
00:17:02,764 --> 00:17:05,888
Who the hell are you to draw these conclusions?

217
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:09,119
This is clearly a serial killer.

218
00:17:10,265 --> 00:17:12,557
If we don't catch him soon, more people will die.

219
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:15,472
There are no similarities between his victims.

220
00:17:15,681 --> 00:17:17,452
This bastard could attack anyone at any time.

221
00:17:17,472 --> 00:17:19,138
This job is very easy for you.

222
00:17:19,242 --> 00:17:21,097
A murder is not a fucking soup!

223
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,660
You can't just mix things together.

224
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,286
No...

225
00:17:24,929 --> 00:17:27,431
I'm not mixing things together. Look...

226
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:32,555
We have had murders in Chungnam province for weeks.

227
00:17:32,931 --> 00:17:35,366
It's not gang related, as none of our informants know anything.

228
00:17:36,744 --> 00:17:38,514
What does your intuition tell you?

229
00:17:39,411 --> 00:17:41,286
I shit on intuition.

230
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,950
Does someone with such high intuition meddle in gang affairs?

231
00:17:46,826 --> 00:17:47,973
This is not the time for that!

232
00:17:48,576 --> 00:17:50,783
Aren't those criminal types?

233
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:54,597
There is not much difference between gangsters and assassins.

234
00:17:54,951 --> 00:17:58,075
Hey Jeong Tae-seok, what the hell is wrong with you?

235
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:03,534
Is it because you want a promotion?

236
00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:13,961
You ask if I want a promotion?!

237
00:18:15,682 --> 00:18:17,036
We need to catch the fucking killer!

238
00:18:20,888 --> 00:18:22,554
The meeting is over. to go outside,

239
00:18:22,762 --> 00:18:24,118
so we can catch this guy.

240
00:18:29,743 --> 00:18:31,617
I didn't drink, so I'll drive.

241
00:18:32,556 --> 00:18:33,701
But boss...

242
00:18:34,222 --> 00:18:35,993
Take the boys and go home.

243
00:18:36,306 --> 00:18:36,930
Yes sir.

244
00:18:49,535 --> 00:18:50,993
Yes, Mr. President.

245
00:18:51,514 --> 00:18:55,106
Sang-do is reckless but he is smart.

246
00:18:55,472 --> 00:18:57,451
He won't cause any more trouble.

247
00:18:59,326 --> 00:19:01,199
Yes, please don't worry.

248
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,076
Have a good night, sir.

249
00:19:35,867 --> 00:19:36,826
Very sorry.

250
00:19:37,763 --> 00:19:39,536
The path is quite slippery.

251
00:19:49,805 --> 00:19:51,492
It's okay, you can go.

252
00:19:51,931 --> 00:19:52,658
That?

253
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,163
But, it was my fault.

254
00:19:55,363 --> 00:19:57,035
It's okay, you can go.

255
00:19:58,556 --> 00:20:00,160
Are you really okay?

256
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,556
Yes I'm fine.

257
00:20:08,805 --> 00:20:10,160
Motherfucker!

258
00:20:31,074 --> 00:20:32,450
What the hell...

259
00:21:00,889 --> 00:21:02,034
Who are you?

260
00:21:03,076 --> 00:21:04,013
Come here!

261
00:23:55,575 --> 00:23:56,619
Who's there?

262
00:24:17,033 --> 00:24:18,282
It wasn't Sangdo.

263
00:24:20,368 --> 00:24:21,408
It was someone I never met.

264
00:24:22,243 --> 00:24:24,116
Boss, it was Sang-do.

265
00:24:24,221 --> 00:24:26,618
It's not someone in our line of work.

266
00:24:27,242 --> 00:24:29,115
He had no reasoning or purpose for his attack.

267
00:24:29,951 --> 00:24:31,616
This bastard is different from us.

268
00:24:31,824 --> 00:24:35,990
Who else would dare attack you?

269
00:24:36,303 --> 00:24:37,241
Give me that.

270
00:24:41,515 --> 00:24:43,493
It was too dark to see clearly.

271
00:24:46,616 --> 00:24:47,763
But try to find it anyway.

272
00:24:47,963 --> 00:24:49,324
I told you to be careful.

273
00:24:49,532 --> 00:24:51,033
Step aside, we're friends.

274
00:24:55,345 --> 00:24:55,951
Oh I'm sorry...

275
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:58,387
I assume the patient is awake now.

276
00:24:58,492 --> 00:24:59,741
What do you want?

277
00:25:00,075 --> 00:25:01,699
Relax, here's a box of "Bachus".

278
00:25:02,325 --> 00:25:05,368
I heard you were stabbed.

279
00:25:05,835 --> 00:25:07,555
I got a call from the hospital.

280
00:25:08,126 --> 00:25:11,242
You must have been embarrassed.

281
00:25:12,032 --> 00:25:13,764
You are supposed to be the toughest gangster of all.

282
00:25:15,617 --> 00:25:18,097
You should be ashamed of being a policeman.

283
00:25:18,805 --> 00:25:20,368
You guys are idiots.

284
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:23,575
You even let this happen to a model citizen like me.

285
00:25:24,534 --> 00:25:25,157
Shit...

286
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:32,284
Model citizen, Jang Dong-soo...

287
00:25:33,181 --> 00:25:36,033
Tell me what happened that night.

288
00:25:36,096 --> 00:25:37,347
I'll catch it for you.

289
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:40,677
I think I can catch him faster.

290
00:25:40,782 --> 00:25:41,407
So you think?

291
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:45,263
Should we bet?

292
00:25:46,303 --> 00:25:48,553
Fool.

293
00:25:49,846 --> 00:25:51,595
I told you I'll catch him.

294
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:56,408
Very well, come closer.

295
00:26:00,534 --> 00:26:05,431
That night, I tripped and hurt myself a bit.

296
00:26:13,534 --> 00:26:15,304
It's true, at night...

297
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:18,056
...you have to be careful where you step.

298
00:26:18,699 --> 00:26:22,950
Very unfortunate to have so many holes in your body from a trip.

299
00:27:12,658 --> 00:27:15,888
Hey, is Jang Dong-soo's car a black Mercedes with the license plate 3849?

300
00:27:19,741 --> 00:27:21,095
Okay bye.

301
00:27:28,075 --> 00:27:30,054
Is he.

302
00:27:31,824 --> 00:27:34,011
Hit him from behind...

303
00:27:35,055 --> 00:27:37,241
...of a white car.

304
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:41,055
He knew he was right.

305
00:27:50,262 --> 00:27:53,575
My God, look at you.

306
00:27:54,743 --> 00:27:55,470
Are you OK?

307
00:27:56,743 --> 00:27:57,428
Sit down.

308
00:27:57,658 --> 00:27:58,388
There is no need.

309
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:01,885
It's very difficult to see you like this.

310
00:28:05,845 --> 00:28:07,556
What do we do now?

311
00:28:08,177 --> 00:28:11,638
We just made peace and you already attacked us.

312
00:28:13,011 --> 00:28:14,055
What do you want me to do now?

313
00:28:17,074 --> 00:28:19,032
Many of my men are crippled.

314
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:21,512
You will pay all our hospital bills.

315
00:28:22,054 --> 00:28:24,033
And then you give up half your territory.

316
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:29,678
I will compensate you very well.

317
00:28:31,427 --> 00:28:31,949
And the territory?

318
00:28:33,948 --> 00:28:35,471
Did you do this as part of your plan?

319
00:28:41,407 --> 00:28:42,094
Dong-soo...

320
00:28:45,784 --> 00:28:47,137
If this was my plan...

321
00:28:49,637 --> 00:28:50,969
...would you still be alive?

322
00:28:53,177 --> 00:28:54,470
Think wisely.

323
00:28:55,949 --> 00:28:57,616
I'm also quite curious...

324
00:28:58,742 --> 00:29:00,409
Who would do this to you?

325
00:29:02,595 --> 00:29:03,511
Leave.

326
00:29:04,073 --> 00:29:05,989
How embarrassing!

327
00:29:06,094 --> 00:29:09,533
If they kicked my ass like that, I'd kill myself.

328
00:29:13,178 --> 00:29:16,012
Could you trust me and put me on this case?

329
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:18,740
I will solve this case immediately.

330
00:29:18,907 --> 00:29:21,512
You should take a vacation.

331
00:29:21,992 --> 00:29:24,408
We don't have many officers.

332
00:29:24,533 --> 00:29:27,261
So why are you trying to get into someone else's job?

333
00:29:27,511 --> 00:29:29,261
Boss, this is a big problem.

334
00:29:29,323 --> 00:29:31,365
All these murders are connected to each other.

335
00:29:31,565 --> 00:29:34,324
You solve one and you will solve them all.

336
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:36,075
Fuck off!

337
00:29:40,427 --> 00:29:43,721
For the first time, a victim has survived an attack.

338
00:29:45,699 --> 00:29:47,032
What are you talking about?

339
00:29:55,823 --> 00:29:56,512
Jang Dong Soo.

340
00:29:58,553 --> 00:29:59,469
¿Jang Dong-soo?

341
00:30:00,908 --> 00:30:03,410
A few days ago he was attacked.

342
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:06,615
After two hours of surgery, he barely survived.

343
00:30:06,815 --> 00:30:07,762
Listen to what you say.

344
00:30:07,962 --> 00:30:09,741
Think about it.

345
00:30:10,927 --> 00:30:14,075
What jerk would attack the toughest gangster in the district?

346
00:30:14,323 --> 00:30:16,180
This guy clearly doesn't give a shit.

347
00:30:16,927 --> 00:30:19,719
I'm sure he's a serial killer.

348
00:30:19,845 --> 00:30:20,781
Be quiet!

349
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:26,220
The Jang Dong-soo case is a gang case. I'll assign team two.

350
00:30:28,178 --> 00:30:30,825
I'm warning you, don't get involved!

351
00:30:31,657 --> 00:30:32,429
Shall.

352
00:30:33,408 --> 00:30:35,718
Stop trying to cover it up.

353
00:30:36,615 --> 00:30:38,824
Now it's not the moment.

354
00:30:41,575 --> 00:30:42,761
What did you say?

355
00:30:42,824 --> 00:30:43,866
You already heard me.

356
00:30:44,428 --> 00:30:45,929
Motherfucker.

357
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:53,137
Let's say you're right.

358
00:30:54,513 --> 00:30:56,284
It means that Jang Dong-soo is a witness.

359
00:30:56,492 --> 00:30:57,978
How are you going to make him talk?

360
00:30:58,178 --> 00:31:00,219
You can't arrest him without a warrant.

361
00:31:00,365 --> 00:31:01,926
That bastard has committed many crimes.

362
00:31:04,177 --> 00:31:06,575
Whatever it takes, we have to bring it.

363
00:31:07,263 --> 00:31:08,950
It's about to explode.

364
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,887
If he finds and kills the murderer,

365
00:31:12,156 --> 00:31:13,908
we will not solve any of the cases.

366
00:31:14,158 --> 00:31:15,719
How can Jang Dong-soo catch him?

367
00:31:16,844 --> 00:31:17,886
He's a gangster, not a cop.

368
00:31:18,178 --> 00:31:21,824
For those guys, finding people is a specialty.

369
00:31:22,024 --> 00:31:23,010
And Jang Dong-soo...

370
00:31:26,909 --> 00:31:28,906
...he saw the face of the murderer.

371
00:31:36,031 --> 00:31:36,761
Shall.

372
00:31:38,261 --> 00:31:40,344
What you say is bullshit.

373
00:31:41,241 --> 00:31:41,909
Out.

374
00:31:55,636 --> 00:31:58,345
Why don't you talk to the owner?

375
00:32:02,317 --> 00:32:03,317
What do you want me to do?

376
00:32:03,318 --> 00:32:04,318
That? Birthday?

377
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:06,322
I need to work to earn money.

378
00:32:13,324 --> 00:32:15,303
Is the child's birthday important at this time?

379
00:32:15,532 --> 00:32:17,218
I'm tired.

380
00:32:17,343 --> 00:32:20,802
I've gone two days without sleep and you scold me for a bloody birthday!

381
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:22,700
It must be your son's birthday.

382
00:32:25,196 --> 00:32:25,719
That?

383
00:32:28,052 --> 00:32:29,844
The boy you mentioned.

384
00:32:40,719 --> 00:32:41,720
Give me that.

385
00:32:47,761 --> 00:32:49,303
A sharp face.

386
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:52,511
Thin cheeks and an angular jaw.

387
00:32:54,949 --> 00:32:57,290
Long and narrow nose.

388
00:33:01,241 --> 00:33:03,844
Big mouth compared to the nose.

389
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:11,927
Very accurate.

390
00:33:21,093 --> 00:33:22,761
You shouldn't have children.

391
00:33:24,614 --> 00:33:25,990
It's not the kid's fault.

392
00:33:31,823 --> 00:33:33,512
Find him before the police do.

393
00:33:33,543 --> 00:33:34,531
Yes sir.

394
00:34:15,698 --> 00:34:16,947
Where I am?

395
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:19,845
Who are you?

396
00:35:03,574 --> 00:35:05,408
Thanks for your cooperation.

397
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,405
This illegal gambling hall is now under our control.

398
00:35:12,488 --> 00:35:14,885
Stay there and don't move.

399
00:35:15,416 --> 00:35:17,134
Where is your boss?

400
00:35:17,968 --> 00:35:19,947
Tell him to come!

401
00:35:25,594 --> 00:35:27,885
Really? One moment...

402
00:35:32,259 --> 00:35:34,135
It's okay, continue.

403
00:35:35,178 --> 00:35:39,115
Jang Dong-soo is a cunning bastard.

404
00:35:39,616 --> 00:35:42,178
It has 97 slot machines, but 63 of them are rigged.

405
00:35:42,378 --> 00:35:43,302
Today I will receive the arrest warrant.

406
00:35:43,448 --> 00:35:45,990
Wait a second.

407
00:35:48,011 --> 00:35:50,344
So should you get a court order?

408
00:35:50,595 --> 00:35:51,823
What do you want?

409
00:35:52,115 --> 00:35:53,406
The boy who attacked you.

410
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:57,053
Tell me all about him, and I'll let this go.

411
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,156
And if I do not do it?

412
00:36:02,781 --> 00:36:06,907
Since you own my boss, you are not afraid of me, are you?

413
00:36:08,363 --> 00:36:10,675
Listen, Jang Dong-soo.

414
00:36:11,009 --> 00:36:12,426
The guy who attacked you...

415
00:36:13,552 --> 00:36:15,052
...is a serial killer.

416
00:36:17,324 --> 00:36:19,239
This bastard is different.

417
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,593
He's not your usual psychopath.

418
00:36:22,406 --> 00:36:23,529
You are the only witness.

419
00:36:26,677 --> 00:36:27,990
What are you talking about?

420
00:36:29,429 --> 00:36:32,239
Why would I attack someone like you?

421
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:42,905
Most psychopaths murder women,

422
00:36:43,105 --> 00:36:45,156
or people weaker than them.

423
00:36:45,177 --> 00:36:47,031
But this bastard kills without discretion.

424
00:36:48,095 --> 00:36:50,781
If we don't find him soon, more people will die.

425
00:36:52,865 --> 00:36:54,635
What is your problem?

426
00:36:55,906 --> 00:36:58,802
Just give me the information and stay the boss.

427
00:36:59,002 --> 00:37:00,218
It will be good for both of us.

428
00:37:00,823 --> 00:37:02,823
I'll arrest the jerk, I'll take him to trial.

429
00:37:02,824 --> 00:37:03,385
That's all?

430
00:37:03,386 --> 00:37:04,615
And I'm going to put him in a cage.

431
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:05,808
And after that?

432
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:06,693
And then?

433
00:37:16,302 --> 00:37:18,977
The largest luxury casino in the country...

434
00:37:19,177 --> 00:37:23,301
...will be built on this skyscraper penthouse.

435
00:37:23,384 --> 00:37:25,884
The surroundings will become the most popular place in the city,

436
00:37:26,084 --> 00:37:28,497
and will lead to booming profits.

437
00:37:28,697 --> 00:37:32,927
Enough of the stupidity. This project has been blacklisted.

438
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:34,071
It's screwed.

439
00:37:36,906 --> 00:37:40,842
The construction workers have quit.

440
00:37:41,405 --> 00:37:44,865
All of our investors have withdrawn.

441
00:37:45,969 --> 00:37:49,718
There were so many negative rumors about that day.

442
00:37:51,071 --> 00:37:54,087
The Cheongju area has also become a problem.

443
00:37:54,287 --> 00:37:57,303
Sang-Do's men are trying to invade our territory.

444
00:37:58,218 --> 00:37:59,449
Have you found that bastard?

445
00:38:00,238 --> 00:38:04,363
We found your car in the field.

446
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:05,946
His car?

447
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:09,281
He's been in a siding for a couple of days.

448
00:38:09,427 --> 00:38:10,740
The boys found it.

449
00:38:10,781 --> 00:38:12,032
Where is the car now?

450
00:38:12,219 --> 00:38:13,448
We brought it back.

451
00:38:14,114 --> 00:38:17,051
A few days ago there was a murder on the same siding.

452
00:38:18,072 --> 00:38:19,008
And that...

453
00:38:19,946 --> 00:38:22,060
I don't know if he lost it or threw it away.

454
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:25,676
But we found him a few miles from the car.

455
00:38:31,655 --> 00:38:32,988
Save this.

456
00:38:33,468 --> 00:38:34,134
Yes sir.

457
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:41,906
Hello?

458
00:38:42,218 --> 00:38:43,488
It's Jang Dong-soo.

459
00:38:47,426 --> 00:38:48,677
What a surprise.

460
00:38:49,177 --> 00:38:51,300
The murder of the Sintanjin siding...

461
00:38:51,864 --> 00:38:52,802
What about that?

462
00:38:54,573 --> 00:38:55,718
It was that bastard.

463
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:57,136
That?

464
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,978
How do you know that?

465
00:39:04,446 --> 00:39:06,509
We found your car there.

466
00:39:10,136 --> 00:39:12,425
I've gotten a bit reckless these days.

467
00:39:13,801 --> 00:39:16,302
I risk my life by meeting a pig.

468
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:20,364
Listen, when a motherfucker grabs my ankle...

469
00:39:21,426 --> 00:39:24,091
What I can do? I can't cut my own ankle.

470
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,905
I need to cut off his fucking arm.

471
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:29,449
So that bastard wreaked havoc on your operations.

472
00:39:29,738 --> 00:39:32,238
It has destroyed your reputation.

473
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:34,279
Hey.

474
00:39:34,634 --> 00:39:38,217
Anyone who messes with me will face the consequences.

475
00:39:39,447 --> 00:39:42,178
Reputation is everything in my line of work.

476
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:46,759
I'll cut it to pieces

477
00:39:47,446 --> 00:39:49,321
and hang it in public.

478
00:39:50,092 --> 00:39:53,697
Are you telling a policeman that you are going to kill someone?

479
00:39:54,323 --> 00:39:56,614
Well, illegal actions are my specialty.

480
00:39:56,655 --> 00:39:59,946
So one bad guy will get another bad guy?

481
00:40:00,051 --> 00:40:01,178
No.

482
00:40:01,821 --> 00:40:06,363
Two bad guys will catch an even worse one.

483
00:40:10,717 --> 00:40:11,864
These are your car keys.

484
00:40:17,238 --> 00:40:19,656
You know I'm a policeman, right?

485
00:40:20,947 --> 00:40:23,759
I can arrest you immediately.

486
00:40:24,927 --> 00:40:26,510
You ain't gonna do shit.

487
00:40:27,345 --> 00:40:30,280
You want to capture it even more than me.

488
00:40:38,841 --> 00:40:42,323
I will provide the labor and pay for everything.

489
00:40:43,676 --> 00:40:44,947
We share information.

490
00:40:46,449 --> 00:40:47,968
We help each other.

491
00:40:48,657 --> 00:40:49,655
At the end?

492
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,050
Shall we cut it in two halves?

493
00:40:52,404 --> 00:40:54,425
Whoever catches it first gets to keep it.

494
00:40:55,239 --> 00:40:59,407
If I catch him, I can arrest him.

495
00:41:00,468 --> 00:41:02,133
If you catch it, you bury it.

496
00:41:03,238 --> 00:41:04,905
If you have balls, take the deal.

497
00:41:15,134 --> 00:41:16,925
Good offer.

498
00:41:18,218 --> 00:41:20,364
You will regret this.

499
00:41:27,926 --> 00:41:28,989
How old is he?

500
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:32,174
Mid thirties.

501
00:41:32,374 --> 00:41:32,374
Good looking guy.

502
00:41:32,654 --> 00:41:34,926
It was dark and raining so I can't say for sure.

503
00:41:35,614 --> 00:41:37,448
Use this to keep in touch.

504
00:41:40,967 --> 00:41:44,757
A gangster and a cop join forces to catch a demon...

505
00:41:44,957 --> 00:41:46,635
Damn, this is exciting!

506
00:41:57,861 --> 00:42:01,468
"A gangster and a cop join forces to catch a demon."

507
00:42:01,593 --> 00:42:03,427
Damn, this is exciting!

508
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:06,031
Motherfucker...

509
00:42:06,073 --> 00:42:09,322
If we're going to be on the same team, I need to cover myself.

510
00:42:10,053 --> 00:42:12,092
We can't write a contract, right?

511
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:20,405
Wow, you sure thought that through.

512
00:42:23,592 --> 00:42:24,572
Shit!

513
00:42:29,447 --> 00:42:32,842
This fucking idiot is trying to act smart!

514
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:38,737
That's why I can't trust pigs.

515
00:42:53,342 --> 00:42:57,511
You think you can fuck with a cop?

516
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:59,030
Listen, bastard.

517
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:03,696
Once this is over, I'm going to lock your ass up, you son of a bitch!

518
00:43:08,094 --> 00:43:10,051
He stabbed Jang Dong-soo.

519
00:43:10,403 --> 00:43:14,156
He's the same guy who did the Sintanjin murder.

520
00:43:14,779 --> 00:43:16,039
Listen to me.

521
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:18,551
We can solve all the murders at once.

522
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,403
35, male, average height.

523
00:43:23,424 --> 00:43:26,404
Its pattern shows that it only kills at night.

524
00:43:26,738 --> 00:43:29,967
He doesn't care about his safety and only uses a knife.

525
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:30,780
They both have one of these.

526
00:43:31,635 --> 00:43:34,634
The key to catching him is the knife he likes to use.

527
00:43:35,676 --> 00:43:37,759
So far there are no other clues.

528
00:43:42,662 --> 00:43:42,662
Let's catch him.

529
00:43:42,862 --> 00:43:44,301
I made a deal with a cop.

530
00:43:45,948 --> 00:43:47,142
But we won't tell the boss.

531
00:43:47,342 --> 00:43:49,113
How can we trust a policeman?

532
00:43:49,175 --> 00:43:50,842
How can we trust a gangster?

533
00:43:51,072 --> 00:43:52,237
Who trusts him?

534
00:43:52,655 --> 00:43:54,862
We just need your manpower to catch the killer.

535
00:43:55,062 --> 00:43:57,259
This is not something we can do alone.

536
00:43:57,447 --> 00:43:58,802
We need to call the prosecutor.

537
00:43:59,002 --> 00:43:59,913
And then?

538
00:44:00,113 --> 00:44:01,824
The feds will be everywhere.

539
00:44:02,029 --> 00:44:05,258
The media will come in and we won't get any of the glory.

540
00:44:05,466 --> 00:44:08,695
Using Jang Dong-soo as a cover...

541
00:44:08,904 --> 00:44:11,301
...is the only way to solve this case.

542
00:44:11,635 --> 00:44:14,239
We can also hit the Boss.

543
00:44:14,426 --> 00:44:18,238
Jang Dong-soo has seen his face and is in possession of his car.

544
00:44:18,279 --> 00:44:20,154
We can't find someone with just a photocopy.

545
00:44:20,488 --> 00:44:22,446
We need forensic medicine.

546
00:44:22,571 --> 00:44:25,653
We use the gang to find the killer...

547
00:44:25,861 --> 00:44:27,758
...and then we show up right at the end.

548
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:31,614
I will use the cops until I no longer need them.

549
00:44:42,551 --> 00:44:44,344
We are citizens who pay taxes.

550
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:47,320
It's time to get police help for once.

551
00:44:52,677 --> 00:44:55,528
It may look like a warehouse from the outside,

552
00:44:55,799 --> 00:44:58,591
but this is where thousands of rigged gaming machines are made.

553
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:00,404
And then they're shipped all over the country.

554
00:45:00,604 --> 00:45:01,613
Moron.

555
00:45:10,364 --> 00:45:11,821
We'll find some clues here.

556
00:45:11,925 --> 00:45:15,571
His hair or fingerprints, I think something will come up.

557
00:45:16,051 --> 00:45:18,321
I think so. Something has to come out.

558
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:20,384
We'll search every inch of this car.

559
00:45:20,425 --> 00:45:22,092
Alright, let's get started.

560
00:45:23,404 --> 00:45:26,133
Leave all the dirty work to Jang Dong-soo.

561
00:45:26,446 --> 00:45:29,113
We will concentrate on the Sintanjin case.

562
00:45:29,425 --> 00:45:32,550
This is the video from Sintanjin's security camera.

563
00:45:32,633 --> 00:45:33,863
Until now...

564
00:45:33,988 --> 00:45:37,321
...has driven a vehicle to each of his murders.

565
00:45:37,759 --> 00:45:39,926
That makes it much harder to catch.

566
00:45:41,404 --> 00:45:46,300
These are the murders we know about, but I'm sure there are more.

567
00:45:46,446 --> 00:45:48,906
Review all recent murder cases.

568
00:45:49,069 --> 00:45:50,779
If anything comes up, please let me know right away.

569
00:45:51,134 --> 00:45:52,613
That guy is a bomb waiting to explode.

570
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,509
We don't know where he's going to attack next time.

571
00:45:56,884 --> 00:45:58,404
So stay alert and don't be lazy.

572
00:45:58,675 --> 00:45:59,405
Good?

573
00:45:59,738 --> 00:46:00,882
Yeah.

574
00:46:07,009 --> 00:46:09,843
Once this is done, we will lock up all the gangsters.

575
00:46:09,926 --> 00:46:10,861
The plan is perfect.

576
00:46:13,277 --> 00:46:15,298
It's up to us to catch this guy.

577
00:46:17,049 --> 00:46:19,133
Before that, let's take care of Sang-do.

578
00:47:16,634 --> 00:47:17,611
Idiot!

579
00:47:22,883 --> 00:47:23,862
You're crazy?

580
00:47:24,405 --> 00:47:26,006
What the hell are you doing here?

581
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:28,591
What do you think?

582
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:30,195
I was waiting for you.

583
00:47:32,404 --> 00:47:33,550
I think you hurt my back.

584
00:47:33,903 --> 00:47:35,518
You shouldn't have scared me.

585
00:47:35,529 --> 00:47:36,987
It was an instinctive reaction.

586
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,133
Give me something.

587
00:47:45,049 --> 00:47:45,725
Hey.

588
00:47:45,925 --> 00:47:47,340
Can you take a look at this?

589
00:47:47,757 --> 00:47:48,591
It is urgent.

590
00:47:49,071 --> 00:47:49,882
What is it?

591
00:47:50,842 --> 00:47:52,174
Nothing special.

592
00:47:52,237 --> 00:47:54,404
Just a little hair and blood.

593
00:47:54,477 --> 00:47:55,695
Tell me who it belongs to.

594
00:47:55,924 --> 00:47:57,008
Jeong Tae-seok...

595
00:47:58,674 --> 00:48:01,092
What's going on? You are not like that.

596
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:06,465
This world is dirty.

597
00:48:07,821 --> 00:48:09,549
I'm doing what needs to be done.

598
00:48:09,882 --> 00:48:11,298
I'm not surprised.

599
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:28,384
This is strange.

600
00:48:29,676 --> 00:48:31,508
He even left the murder weapon.

601
00:48:33,091 --> 00:48:35,487
A police force that can't even solve murders...

602
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:38,259
A police force that complains about everything...

603
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:44,216
And now we have murdered gangsters!

604
00:48:44,717 --> 00:48:45,590
What are they going to do?

605
00:48:47,757 --> 00:48:49,010
What the fuck are they going to do?

606
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:51,820
Do they have mouths? Speak up!

607
00:48:51,924 --> 00:48:55,819
I assigned the Heo Sang-Do case to the second team.

608
00:48:55,923 --> 00:48:57,279
They will investigate it.

609
00:48:57,529 --> 00:48:58,465
What are you all doing?

610
00:48:59,571 --> 00:49:02,256
Stop looking at the fucking screens!

611
00:49:02,923 --> 00:49:03,424
come out!

612
00:49:04,799 --> 00:49:06,321
I said get out of here!

613
00:49:07,613 --> 00:49:11,903
Get out there, work or something!

614
00:49:14,173 --> 00:49:16,173
Why are they so slow?

615
00:49:16,215 --> 00:49:17,111
Move your ass!

616
00:49:17,445 --> 00:49:18,425
If that?

617
00:49:18,571 --> 00:49:19,215
Hey!

618
00:49:19,904 --> 00:49:21,030
Want to die?

619
00:49:21,051 --> 00:49:21,882
What's happening?

620
00:49:22,134 --> 00:49:23,406
You said this is nothing special.

621
00:49:23,653 --> 00:49:25,362
I just received the results.

622
00:49:26,007 --> 00:49:27,027
It's interesting.

623
00:49:27,069 --> 00:49:28,461
Characteristics of.

624
00:49:28,661 --> 00:49:28,661
What about someone else?

625
00:49:28,861 --> 00:49:33,467
I found the DNA of all the recent victims.

626
00:49:33,697 --> 00:49:34,072
Yeah?

627
00:49:38,092 --> 00:49:39,736
Any DNA that isn't from the victims?

628
00:49:39,924 --> 00:49:40,447
No.

629
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:42,154
That makes no sense.

630
00:49:42,528 --> 00:49:43,453
You did it well?

631
00:49:43,653 --> 00:49:44,779
There is nothing else there!

632
00:49:44,883 --> 00:49:46,508
But that's not the problem.

633
00:49:46,592 --> 00:49:48,320
We have another big problem.

634
00:49:48,383 --> 00:49:49,215
Wait a second...

635
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:53,861
Dime.

636
00:49:54,027 --> 00:49:57,550
The murder weapon in the Heo Sang-do case...

637
00:49:57,808 --> 00:50:00,591
...contains the DNA of all previous victims as well.

638
00:50:00,791 --> 00:50:01,070
That?

639
00:50:01,612 --> 00:50:03,362
It means the same guy killed everyone.

640
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:07,360
These will be officially classified as serial killings.

641
00:50:09,007 --> 00:50:09,591
I have to hang up.

642
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:15,924
Hey Jang Dong-soo!

643
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:18,257
Was you!

644
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:22,057
I will call you later.

645
00:50:22,257 --> 00:50:23,673
Answer me, you son of a bitch!

646
00:50:46,466 --> 00:50:48,425
This idiot is bothering me again.

647
00:50:48,625 --> 00:50:48,625
Fool!

648
00:50:49,902 --> 00:50:51,362
This time he came to my house.

649
00:50:52,528 --> 00:50:54,424
No, it's my problem, I handle it.

650
00:50:54,695 --> 00:50:55,715
Lets talk later.

651
00:50:59,885 --> 00:51:03,215
Both the cops and the gangsters are fucking rotten.

652
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:06,694
Aren't you a policeman?

653
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:13,591
Tell me, son of a bitch.

654
00:51:14,466 --> 00:51:15,925
You killed Heo Sang-do?

655
00:51:19,195 --> 00:51:20,403
Yes, I killed him.

656
00:51:27,446 --> 00:51:30,111
I can't believe I trusted a fucking gangster.

657
00:51:32,715 --> 00:51:34,258
You "trusted" me?!

658
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:36,943
Even dogs laugh when they hear that!

659
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:39,278
Nothing has changed.

660
00:51:39,632 --> 00:51:41,717
We're still going to catch him.

661
00:51:42,259 --> 00:51:42,943
Do you understand?

662
00:51:46,716 --> 00:51:47,548
You...

663
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,527
When this is all over...

664
00:51:52,028 --> 00:51:54,674
I'm going to lock your ass.

665
00:51:58,445 --> 00:51:59,695
Do what you want.

666
00:52:04,527 --> 00:52:07,862
The recent murders that have taken place since July,

667
00:52:08,049 --> 00:52:10,633
they have now been officially classified as serial murders.

668
00:52:10,675 --> 00:52:16,402
Jurisdiction of these cases has been transferred to the elite criminal unit,

669
00:52:16,465 --> 00:52:19,745
You have started your research in earnest.

670
00:52:19,945 --> 00:52:21,639
Although the murders took place in one area,

671
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:23,425
Police across the country are uniting

672
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,423
pooling their resources and knowledge...

673
00:52:26,819 --> 00:52:31,933
...in an attempt to quickly catch the killer.

674
00:52:32,133 --> 00:52:33,990
They are hoping for a quick resolution so that

675
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:36,405
citizens can continue to live their lives without fear.

676
00:52:39,381 --> 00:52:40,738
You arrived early.

677
00:52:41,401 --> 00:52:42,027
This way.

678
00:52:51,446 --> 00:52:54,695
"The victim was the leader of a criminal organization in Chungnam.

679
00:52:55,153 --> 00:52:58,736
It is believed that a turf war was taking place."

680
00:52:58,944 --> 00:53:02,193
If you had given us the case from the beginning,

681
00:53:02,235 --> 00:53:03,674
now we would not have had these problems.

682
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:07,111
Murder is not child's play.

683
00:53:07,507 --> 00:53:10,758
All you did was screw up the investigation.

684
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:15,381
You come to someone else's house and talk like that?

685
00:53:16,966 --> 00:53:17,882
Got a problem, bitch?

686
00:53:18,215 --> 00:53:19,238
I'm wrong?

687
00:53:19,526 --> 00:53:20,277
¿"Perra"?

688
00:53:21,194 --> 00:53:23,320
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?

689
00:53:31,966 --> 00:53:35,904
"The murder weapon found at the scene...

690
00:53:36,237 --> 00:53:40,341
...contained the DNA of the other victims.

691
00:53:40,654 --> 00:53:45,008
As a result, the police believe the murder cases are linked,

692
00:53:45,088 --> 00:53:49,674
and that each victim was killed by the same person."

693
00:53:51,216 --> 00:53:52,882
I didn't kill that...

694
00:53:53,069 --> 00:53:57,321
"They have now been officially classified as serial murders.

695
00:53:57,446 --> 00:54:04,175
Authorities have expressed confidence in their ability to catch the killer,

696
00:54:04,776 --> 00:54:07,381
and with the help of the latest forensic technology,

697
00:54:07,402 --> 00:54:09,423
They promised to achieve a quick resolution.

698
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,195
The authorities are also on guard, as it is expected that

699
00:54:14,395 --> 00:54:16,111
the victim's funeral is attended by a large number of gangsters."

700
00:54:31,904 --> 00:54:33,214
I'm surprised to see you here.

701
00:54:35,631 --> 00:54:38,298
Of course I came. He was my friend.

702
00:55:22,882 --> 00:55:23,487
Hello.

703
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,049
Jang Dong-soo, come here.

704
00:55:25,236 --> 00:55:26,715
Why would I go there?

705
00:55:26,757 --> 00:55:29,818
You need to clean up your own mess! Hurry up and come here.

706
00:55:44,298 --> 00:55:45,111
Who are you?

707
00:56:00,421 --> 00:56:04,090
"Someone used my knife to kill Heo Sang-do."

708
00:57:04,383 --> 00:57:07,088
I no longer care who wins our bet.

709
00:57:07,422 --> 00:57:09,557
If the crime unit catches him before we do,

710
00:57:09,757 --> 00:57:11,276
Both of our careers are screwed.

711
00:57:13,652 --> 00:57:15,923
Is this what you do daily?

712
00:57:17,028 --> 00:57:19,299
I feel bad for you poor cops.

713
00:57:20,215 --> 00:57:22,506
Hey, motherfucker, your life is just crime.

714
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:25,089
If it weren't for people like me, you wouldn't have a job.

715
00:57:26,047 --> 00:57:28,902
In life there are predators and prey.

716
00:57:29,632 --> 00:57:32,257
Yes... And there are those who are stabbed.

717
00:57:32,341 --> 00:57:34,320
The guy attacked me from behind.

718
00:57:34,943 --> 00:57:37,233
Even then, I took the knife from him and stabbed him too.

719
00:57:37,254 --> 00:57:38,276
Wait!

720
00:57:38,778 --> 00:57:39,380
What is it?

721
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:41,235
Did you say you stabbed him too?

722
00:57:41,435 --> 00:57:41,986
What about that?

723
00:57:42,299 --> 00:57:44,007
I found something.

724
00:57:54,819 --> 00:57:56,193
What is this?

725
00:58:20,047 --> 00:58:21,775
Jang Dong-soo, what the hell is this?

726
00:58:21,837 --> 00:58:23,090
Who are these guys?

727
00:59:17,048 --> 00:59:18,506
move!

728
00:59:44,318 --> 00:59:45,983
Die bastard!

729
01:00:33,068 --> 01:00:34,922
Hey! Hey!

730
01:00:42,464 --> 01:00:44,401
Hey you son of a bitch!

731
01:00:47,651 --> 01:00:48,693
Enough, he's dead.

732
01:00:50,109 --> 01:00:51,837
Hurry up and go, I'll take care of this.

733
01:00:52,109 --> 01:00:54,130
He's fine.

734
01:00:54,339 --> 01:00:57,090
It's just a wound...

735
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:58,609
Just a little blood...

736
01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:00,796
Get the hell out of here!

737
01:01:17,068 --> 01:01:20,047
"Police claim they have sufficient evidence to identify the suspect,

738
01:01:20,151 --> 01:01:23,798
and it's only a matter of time before they catch him.

739
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:29,880
Authorities are believed to have traced his whereabouts to a narrow area."

740
01:01:34,402 --> 01:01:37,129
Honey, where are you?

741
01:02:12,590 --> 01:02:15,671
Sleeping like nothing is happening...

742
01:02:17,464 --> 01:02:19,589
Why is his face like this?

743
01:02:19,941 --> 01:02:21,192
Wake up, idiot!

744
01:02:23,402 --> 01:02:25,882
What have you been doing?

745
01:02:27,339 --> 01:02:28,274
Fuck off.

746
01:02:30,921 --> 01:02:32,340
Where the hell are you going?

747
01:02:32,984 --> 01:02:34,234
Take this.

748
01:02:34,442 --> 01:02:35,275
It's a kidnapping case.

749
01:02:35,526 --> 01:02:37,672
Hurry up and go meet the team.

750
01:02:38,443 --> 01:02:41,048
Kidnapping? Fuck you with this.

751
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:43,256
We need to catch the serial killer.

752
01:02:43,274 --> 01:02:44,484
Listen, you son of a bitch!

753
01:02:50,964 --> 01:02:54,150
Can't you see that this is no longer our case?

754
01:02:54,797 --> 01:02:57,881
Take the first team and go do what I tell you.

755
01:03:01,463 --> 01:03:05,255
I told you from the beginning that he was a serial killer!

756
01:03:06,339 --> 01:03:09,045
The crime unit? The first team? They are all morons!

757
01:03:09,254 --> 01:03:11,110
Those idiots don't know anything.

758
01:03:11,795 --> 01:03:14,171
Those idiots don't know anything!

759
01:03:14,213 --> 01:03:15,193
Hey you son of a bitch!

760
01:03:15,859 --> 01:03:16,756
What did you just say?

761
01:03:16,819 --> 01:03:17,963
Be quiet!

762
01:03:23,276 --> 01:03:25,838
At that time you had no evidence that he was a serial killer.

763
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:28,755
No forensics or witnesses.

764
01:03:29,318 --> 01:03:31,463
If you're so smart, you should have caught it right away!

765
01:03:35,067 --> 01:03:35,985
Shit.

766
01:03:44,797 --> 01:03:47,360
The victim was a venture capitalist.

767
01:03:52,462 --> 01:03:53,088
Brother.

768
01:03:56,190 --> 01:03:58,879
Take care of it and solve it.

769
01:04:01,776 --> 01:04:04,694
Did you make a deal with Jang Dong-Soo?

770
01:04:05,568 --> 01:04:07,505
What happened to your face?

771
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:09,316
Something is happening.

772
01:04:11,068 --> 01:04:13,047
Stop talking shit.

773
01:04:15,110 --> 01:04:17,464
Examine the work of the victim and his wife.

774
01:04:18,901 --> 01:04:20,943
How many times will you do this?

775
01:04:21,506 --> 01:04:23,527
Why do you keep changing the meeting place?

776
01:04:24,087 --> 01:04:25,568
Is he still alive?

777
01:04:25,985 --> 01:04:28,795
If you want the money, put it on the phone.

778
01:04:31,088 --> 01:04:34,402
This is your last chance. Come to the meeting place...

779
01:04:35,065 --> 01:04:35,775
...right now.

780
01:04:43,277 --> 01:04:46,442
What are you doing? Go inside.

781
01:04:46,651 --> 01:04:49,213
Did you come to drop off a bag?

782
01:04:49,338 --> 01:04:50,859
You can give it to me.

783
01:04:52,796 --> 01:04:55,839
Why do you give the bag to her?

784
01:05:02,234 --> 01:05:06,005
Perfect, ignore the instructions of the police...

785
01:05:14,235 --> 01:05:15,775
Someone on the roof.

786
01:05:16,337 --> 01:05:17,877
He was on the roof.

787
01:05:18,003 --> 01:05:20,399
It's heading north!

788
01:05:20,503 --> 01:05:21,212
Where is?

789
01:05:23,213 --> 01:05:25,047
Cut him off on one side!

790
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:25,777
Hey!

791
01:05:27,026 --> 01:05:28,838
What the hell are you doing?

792
01:05:29,109 --> 01:05:31,294
Hurry up and close his way!

793
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:32,025
For!

794
01:05:33,545 --> 01:05:34,920
I do not see it!

795
01:05:35,483 --> 01:05:36,693
It's in the Main Street!

796
01:05:38,006 --> 01:05:40,025
Where the hell are you?

797
01:05:44,546 --> 01:05:45,774
Stop, you son of a bitch!

798
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:50,879
This son of a bitch...

799
01:05:59,087 --> 01:06:00,402
Go down the stairs!

800
01:06:00,444 --> 01:06:01,275
Hurry up!

801
01:06:03,817 --> 01:06:05,567
I don't see it around here!

802
01:06:05,587 --> 01:06:07,817
Where the hell did he go?

803
01:06:08,025 --> 01:06:09,337
I'll be ahead!

804
01:06:10,401 --> 01:06:12,795
Take the stairs this way!

805
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:14,421
I see!

806
01:06:17,485 --> 01:06:19,484
You just turned the corner! Cut him off in front!

807
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:20,567
I'm on my way!

808
01:06:23,337 --> 01:06:24,441
Over there!

809
01:06:26,441 --> 01:06:27,796
Go that way.

810
01:06:38,943 --> 01:06:42,839
Damn woman, why did you take the bag?

811
01:06:43,606 --> 01:06:46,650
Leave me alone, I did nothing wrong.

812
01:06:46,692 --> 01:06:48,942
Someone asked me to take it.

813
01:06:49,652 --> 01:06:51,130
Who is that someone?

814
01:06:51,401 --> 01:06:54,067
Tell us or you will have problems!

815
01:06:54,314 --> 01:06:55,900
It was someone I don't know!

816
01:06:55,921 --> 01:06:59,650
He was having dinner alone and he asked me to take the bag.

817
01:07:01,254 --> 01:07:03,212
He gave me 20 dollars.

818
01:07:10,546 --> 01:07:11,753
What does he look like?

819
01:07:12,233 --> 01:07:14,943
It's pretty ordinary.

820
01:07:15,235 --> 01:07:16,253
Was he only here to eat?

821
01:07:18,588 --> 01:07:19,839
He also drank Soju!

822
01:07:20,025 --> 01:07:20,693
Chamisul brand.

823
01:07:23,484 --> 01:07:24,837
Where is the Soju bottle?

824
01:07:26,836 --> 01:07:28,427
Chamisul or not,

825
01:07:28,627 --> 01:07:31,275
all the bottles here are the same.

826
01:07:32,422 --> 01:07:33,943
But nothing, good luck.

827
01:07:34,235 --> 01:07:36,088
fuck me...

828
01:07:40,357 --> 01:07:41,523
Hey, Dong-chul!

829
01:07:42,065 --> 01:07:43,482
Just look for the Chamisul brand.

830
01:07:43,682 --> 01:07:45,255
Just Chamisul, okay?

831
01:07:45,455 --> 01:07:46,609
What a nightmare.

832
01:07:47,694 --> 01:07:48,921
The bottles are the same!

833
01:07:52,149 --> 01:07:53,400
Hurry up.

834
01:07:54,441 --> 01:07:55,150
Hurry?

835
01:07:58,795 --> 01:08:01,065
What about the steering wheel cover I gave you?

836
01:08:01,713 --> 01:08:03,296
The results will come back later today.

837
01:08:05,086 --> 01:08:09,316
I'll charge you $2,000 per machine.

838
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:11,088
Thank you.

839
01:08:11,297 --> 01:08:13,276
I will also provide full technical support.

840
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:16,317
How can you give them to us so cheap?

841
01:08:16,462 --> 01:08:18,670
If you can do this for us,

842
01:08:19,693 --> 01:08:21,357
we would be very happy.

843
01:08:22,545 --> 01:08:26,816
I don't know if I'm happy with this opportunity,

844
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:28,691
considering what happened to Sang-do.

845
01:08:30,151 --> 01:08:31,815
Be careful, everyone.

846
01:08:31,898 --> 01:08:34,796
After Dong-soo was attacked,

847
01:08:35,128 --> 01:08:37,692
Sang-do was killed and his deputy disappeared.

848
01:08:38,547 --> 01:08:39,942
Shut up and eat your dinner.

849
01:09:05,649 --> 01:09:06,463
What are you doing here?

850
01:09:08,796 --> 01:09:10,004
Find this boy first.

851
01:09:12,463 --> 01:09:14,211
The results are a bit strange.

852
01:09:15,296 --> 01:09:17,108
We must be quite lucky,

853
01:09:17,504 --> 01:09:19,212
because it seems that he tried to erase them,

854
01:09:19,692 --> 01:09:21,504
but I was able to recover some prints.

855
01:09:22,005 --> 01:09:23,045
It was in the bottle of alcohol.

856
01:09:23,776 --> 01:09:26,129
The same imprint is also on the steering wheel cover.

857
01:09:28,171 --> 01:09:30,359
He has not been home for more than 3 months.

858
01:09:30,464 --> 01:09:31,409
Didn't he say where he was going?

859
01:09:31,609 --> 01:09:35,085
No, but I usually traveled for work.

860
01:09:35,356 --> 01:09:37,046
This time he's gone too long.

861
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:39,503
I was worried so I reported it to the police.

862
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:40,984
Did you have a problem with him?

863
01:09:41,650 --> 01:09:43,318
No problem at all.

864
01:09:43,328 --> 01:09:44,942
He always paid on time.

865
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:46,941
And he never drank.

866
01:09:47,254 --> 01:09:49,734
He is a faithful Christian

867
01:09:50,169 --> 01:09:51,816
and live a clean life.

868
01:10:22,774 --> 01:10:24,212
"The results are a bit strange.

869
01:10:24,815 --> 01:10:26,502
We must be quite lucky,

870
01:10:26,919 --> 01:10:28,918
because it looks like he tried to erase them..."

871
01:11:04,692 --> 01:11:06,357
017-684-2784

872
01:11:06,859 --> 01:11:08,691
Find all the information about the owner of this number.

873
01:11:09,419 --> 01:11:11,296
We have the hijacker's voice on file, right?

874
01:11:11,439 --> 01:11:13,689
Send me that right away.

875
01:11:17,025 --> 01:11:19,942
I heard you paid for Sang-do's funeral.

876
01:11:20,294 --> 01:11:23,858
Dong-soo sure is a faithful friend.

877
01:11:24,754 --> 01:11:26,317
Be that way for me too, okay?

878
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:32,935
I told you to shut up and eat.

879
01:11:33,135 --> 01:11:35,440
So why are you still talking?

880
01:11:36,566 --> 01:11:39,398
I invited you here and treated you with respect.

881
01:11:40,567 --> 01:11:43,338
I just wanted to help my brothers,

882
01:11:45,525 --> 01:11:46,648
so eat your food!

883
01:11:53,525 --> 01:11:54,836
Enjoy your dinner.

884
01:11:56,442 --> 01:11:58,421
Look at the photo I sent you.

885
01:11:58,856 --> 01:11:59,482
And listen to this:

886
01:12:02,816 --> 01:12:06,795
“This is your last chance. Come to the meeting place…

887
01:12:07,252 --> 01:12:08,065
...right now.

888
01:12:09,565 --> 01:12:10,378
Very sorry.

889
01:12:11,586 --> 01:12:13,357
The road is slippery.

890
01:12:14,316 --> 01:12:16,398
But after all, it was my fault."

891
01:12:25,316 --> 01:12:27,545
His name is Kang Kyeong-ho, he is 35 years old.

892
01:12:28,567 --> 01:12:31,544
He grew up in an orphanage after his father was jailed for abusing him.

893
01:12:31,648 --> 01:12:32,858
He has no record.

894
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:35,365
He calls his mother every day.

895
01:12:35,565 --> 01:12:37,192
But it does it using prepaid phones.

896
01:12:37,439 --> 01:12:40,775
Before August, every call he made was in the Chungcheong area.

897
01:12:40,962 --> 01:12:44,837
Since then, he has called from all over the country.

898
01:12:45,037 --> 01:12:49,211
We traced most of your calls to Ansan.

899
01:12:49,629 --> 01:12:51,607
But more specifically from this area of ​​the city.

900
01:12:51,794 --> 01:12:52,361
¿ En Danwon?

901
01:12:52,561 --> 01:12:53,128
Correct.

902
01:12:53,337 --> 01:12:54,816
There are some universities here.

903
01:12:54,962 --> 01:12:58,067
So there are many cheaper rooms and apartments.

904
01:12:58,108 --> 01:13:00,814
And many old houses too.

905
01:13:01,014 --> 01:13:03,230
What a headache...

906
01:13:03,272 --> 01:13:04,669
This means that...

907
01:13:05,502 --> 01:13:08,484
...after attacking Jang Dong-soo, he came here to hide.

908
01:13:08,734 --> 01:13:09,614
Motherfucker...

909
01:13:09,814 --> 01:13:11,359
What did you just say?

910
01:13:11,559 --> 01:13:12,211
¿"Jang Dong-soo"?

911
01:13:12,648 --> 01:13:13,689
Is the boss your friend?

912
01:13:13,877 --> 01:13:15,400
Look at this jerk.

913
01:13:16,065 --> 01:13:18,482
"Fool"? Do you think you are better than us?

914
01:13:21,024 --> 01:13:21,900
Motherfucker!

915
01:13:22,418 --> 01:13:24,628
You sons of bitches!

916
01:13:33,399 --> 01:13:34,107
Come here.

917
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:43,668
Listen.

918
01:13:45,814 --> 01:13:47,067
If we don't catch this boy,

919
01:13:48,023 --> 01:13:50,231
our races are over!

920
01:13:53,710 --> 01:13:55,293
We are all in the same boat.

921
01:13:56,358 --> 01:13:58,212
So let's be serious and get it right.

922
01:14:00,877 --> 01:14:02,046
Let's go!

923
01:14:25,085 --> 01:14:26,295
Have you received the photo?

924
01:14:26,772 --> 01:14:27,795
Yes sir!

925
01:14:27,982 --> 01:14:30,919
They only have one task.

926
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:34,900
No matter what it takes, find that bastard!

927
01:14:35,068 --> 01:14:36,086
Yes sir!

928
01:14:37,607 --> 01:14:39,417
They run around the area.

929
01:14:39,709 --> 01:14:42,002
If you see someone who looks like him,

930
01:14:42,482 --> 01:14:45,484
call one of these guys immediately.

931
01:14:46,481 --> 01:14:48,148
5 people per team.

932
01:14:48,690 --> 01:14:51,816
The person in charge of each group will report every 8 hours.

933
01:15:04,942 --> 01:15:06,629
We're going to cover the whole neighborhood.

934
01:15:06,942 --> 01:15:10,293
Each team will have a designated area to search.

935
01:15:11,358 --> 01:15:14,815
Look for motels, hotels and apartments suitable for one person.

936
01:15:15,629 --> 01:15:16,420
Sorry no.

937
01:15:17,441 --> 01:15:21,294
Any residence with short term lease.

938
01:15:21,398 --> 01:15:23,482
Be sure to check out these places.

939
01:15:28,897 --> 01:15:30,316
Go to the center of the city

940
01:15:30,650 --> 01:15:35,564
pier market and other public areas.

941
01:15:43,066 --> 01:15:45,398
Look for the clubs, Internet cafes, gyms,

942
01:15:45,461 --> 01:15:47,941
karaoke bars, game rooms and other public places.

943
01:15:48,397 --> 01:15:49,169
Do you understand?

944
01:15:49,357 --> 01:15:49,983
Yes sir!

945
01:16:13,066 --> 01:16:15,565
I'm out so get out.

946
01:16:17,022 --> 01:16:17,648
Alright.

947
01:16:18,898 --> 01:16:20,003
I'm so wet.

948
01:16:27,335 --> 01:16:29,314
Hey girl, come here.

949
01:16:31,564 --> 01:16:32,628
Take this.

950
01:16:33,981 --> 01:16:34,628
Alright.

951
01:16:34,774 --> 01:16:35,396
Take it!

952
01:16:35,668 --> 01:16:36,065
Yes sir.

953
01:16:36,941 --> 01:16:37,919
Thank you.

954
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:41,379
But you?

955
01:16:43,190 --> 01:16:44,001
Study hard.

956
01:16:45,461 --> 01:16:46,427
Hey Jang Dong-soo!

957
01:16:46,627 --> 01:16:49,027
We're doing critical work, it's not dinner time.

958
01:16:49,227 --> 01:16:51,628
Idiot, if you make them work, you have to feed them too.

959
01:16:52,233 --> 01:16:53,211
Oh-seong will be here soon.

960
01:16:53,774 --> 01:16:54,730
Where is your umbrella?

961
01:17:00,170 --> 01:17:01,543
What a good boy...

962
01:17:02,128 --> 01:17:02,816
Hey!

963
01:17:03,731 --> 01:17:04,127
Yeah?

964
01:17:04,211 --> 01:17:07,876
Do not accept things from strangers.

965
01:17:08,898 --> 01:17:10,147
This man is a gangster.

966
01:17:10,210 --> 01:17:12,065
You look more like a gangster than him.

967
01:17:12,148 --> 01:17:12,524
That?

968
01:17:14,126 --> 01:17:15,128
Do not laugh.

969
01:17:17,461 --> 01:17:18,751
Be careful.

970
01:17:19,397 --> 01:17:20,626
Thank you.

971
01:17:30,816 --> 01:17:32,587
Our dicks are different,

972
01:17:33,004 --> 01:17:34,794
but our hearts are the same!

973
01:17:34,994 --> 01:17:36,607
Until the end of life!

974
01:17:36,649 --> 01:17:38,397
We are Family!

975
01:17:38,439 --> 01:17:40,439
Thanks boss!

976
01:17:45,629 --> 01:17:49,378
Shit, I don't know if I should laugh or cry.

977
01:17:49,503 --> 01:17:50,544
My God...

978
01:17:50,815 --> 01:17:53,064
Those idiots are going to catch a murderer?

979
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:56,023
Worry about yourselves, idiot.

980
01:17:56,649 --> 01:18:01,210
Salaries like you can't compare to principled fighters like us.

981
01:18:02,169 --> 01:18:06,148
Well then, a drink for our honest gangster.

982
01:18:07,315 --> 01:18:10,939
Just say thank you and be grateful.

983
01:18:11,086 --> 01:18:13,606
I even brought you all this alcohol, so enjoy and drink.

984
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:17,233
Is there anything the great Jang Song-soo can't do?

985
01:18:18,004 --> 01:18:19,148
Do you want to join?

986
01:18:20,626 --> 01:18:21,272
Ought?

987
01:18:22,897 --> 01:18:23,919
You should!

988
01:18:24,813 --> 01:18:28,127
You already look like a gangster. You will probably go up to a higher level.

989
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:30,316
Shut up and drink.

990
01:18:30,650 --> 01:18:32,169
Pour.

991
01:18:41,524 --> 01:18:42,439
No, it's not...

992
01:18:43,232 --> 01:18:44,417
I'm going to take it...

993
01:18:47,210 --> 01:18:49,857
Shit, there's some oil in the cup.

994
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:53,293
I'm in a bad mood. Somebody sing us a song!

995
01:18:53,418 --> 01:18:57,146
Bro, I'm the karaoke master!

996
01:18:57,804 --> 01:19:02,147
In front of all of you, I will give you a great performance.

997
01:19:06,252 --> 01:19:07,294
Hey, shut up.

998
01:19:07,669 --> 01:19:08,607
Turn up the volume!

999
01:19:09,212 --> 01:19:12,627
The student is believed to have been killed on her way home.

1000
01:19:12,961 --> 01:19:14,543
Although the identity has not yet been revealed,

1001
01:19:15,063 --> 01:19:18,876
We know the victim is a teenager.

1002
01:19:19,293 --> 01:19:22,480
The police still do not know the motive of the crime,

1003
01:19:22,709 --> 01:19:28,001
and thinks it may be a random murder.

1004
01:19:28,201 --> 01:19:28,875
Oh-Seong.

1005
01:19:29,521 --> 01:19:30,113
Let's go!

1006
01:19:30,313 --> 01:19:31,605
Get off your ass!

1007
01:19:31,626 --> 01:19:34,128
Search every inch near the number 32 bus route.

1008
01:19:34,273 --> 01:19:35,875
What is it that we missed?

1009
01:19:36,398 --> 01:19:39,751
We'll spread out and each team will do a thorough search of the area.

1010
01:19:39,951 --> 01:19:40,364
Hurry up and move!

1011
01:19:40,564 --> 01:19:42,773
He is in this area, surely.

1012
01:19:43,085 --> 01:19:45,877
You guys go north and we'll search the central plaza.

1013
01:19:46,077 --> 01:19:47,877
I am currently searching the area, sir.

1014
01:19:48,077 --> 01:19:49,877
I found the motel he's staying at!

1015
01:19:49,919 --> 01:19:52,232
Gather everyone and search all nearby vehicles.

1016
01:19:52,432 --> 01:19:55,335
We know which motel you're staying at.

1017
01:19:55,356 --> 01:19:59,210
Check all the businesses around the motel.

1018
01:19:59,410 --> 01:20:01,333
We are the police.

1019
01:20:04,418 --> 01:20:05,315
The room 304.

1020
01:20:15,669 --> 01:20:16,626
Who are you?

1021
01:20:16,939 --> 01:20:19,021
Tell me where it is!

1022
01:20:19,438 --> 01:20:21,188
He left a while ago!

1023
01:20:21,272 --> 01:20:22,231
I found your place.

1024
01:20:22,501 --> 01:20:25,127
Stay alert. We need to catch him!

1025
01:20:26,315 --> 01:20:27,898
Go to your car and wait for him to come back.

1026
01:20:28,086 --> 01:20:29,522
Don't do anything until we tell you.

1027
01:20:29,543 --> 01:20:30,794
He needs to get into the building.

1028
01:20:30,836 --> 01:20:32,063
worry about yourself.

1029
01:20:34,251 --> 01:20:37,543
Call off the search and send only three men this way.

1030
01:21:33,397 --> 01:21:34,419
Nobody move.

1031
01:22:04,313 --> 01:22:04,876
Down!

1032
01:22:25,730 --> 01:22:27,041
You are a dead man!

1033
01:23:21,938 --> 01:23:22,959
Motherfucker!

1034
01:23:26,274 --> 01:23:27,522
Where is he going...

1035
01:23:37,210 --> 01:23:37,981
Hey!

1036
01:23:38,669 --> 01:23:40,209
Stop the car!

1037
01:23:57,438 --> 01:23:58,565
Stop the car!

1038
01:24:02,710 --> 01:24:03,584
move!

1039
01:24:53,187 --> 01:24:54,731
Motherfucker!

1040
01:24:55,689 --> 01:24:56,836
What are you doing?

1041
01:24:59,750 --> 01:25:01,709
We have to catch him, idiot!

1042
01:25:02,836 --> 01:25:03,855
Over there!

1043
01:25:04,625 --> 01:25:06,208
Motherfucker!

1044
01:26:09,793 --> 01:26:11,105
¡Oh-Seong!

1045
01:26:12,124 --> 01:26:13,418
Wake up!

1046
01:26:14,623 --> 01:26:15,751
Over there!

1047
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:17,271
Over there!

1048
01:26:20,419 --> 01:26:20,896
Fast!

1049
01:28:10,812 --> 01:28:12,043
Where are you?

1050
01:28:12,353 --> 01:28:13,772
That son of a bitch is mine.

1051
01:28:13,792 --> 01:28:14,979
Where are you?

1052
01:28:22,998 --> 01:28:24,417
Hey, find Jang Dong-soo.

1053
01:28:25,020 --> 01:28:26,876
He took the murderer!

1054
01:28:33,980 --> 01:28:35,250
Buckle your seat belt.

1055
01:28:35,605 --> 01:28:37,521
You need to live until it kills you.

1056
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:40,082
Can we stop somewhere?

1057
01:28:40,333 --> 01:28:40,833
That?

1058
01:28:42,394 --> 01:28:43,499
I'm hungry.

1059
01:29:06,062 --> 01:29:06,978
This is fun.

1060
01:29:07,852 --> 01:29:09,312
What is the difference between you and me?

1061
01:29:13,501 --> 01:29:15,751
It's obvious, isn't it?

1062
01:29:19,499 --> 01:29:21,979
Who the fuck did you think you were stabbing?

1063
01:29:34,750 --> 01:29:35,668
Isn't it fun?

1064
01:29:36,208 --> 01:29:38,125
Playing with the lives of others.

1065
01:29:43,980 --> 01:29:46,297
He took it to Cheonan!

1066
01:29:46,497 --> 01:29:47,978
He was caught on camera at the toll station.

1067
01:29:48,178 --> 01:29:49,333
Shit.

1068
01:29:52,564 --> 01:29:54,418
kill someone...

1069
01:29:54,959 --> 01:29:57,332
...it's the best feeling in the world.

1070
01:29:57,895 --> 01:30:00,290
Shut your fucking mouth.

1071
01:30:05,418 --> 01:30:06,521
Do you like barbecue?

1072
01:30:08,833 --> 01:30:11,542
I'm going to cut you to pieces.

1073
01:30:12,518 --> 01:30:14,478
Then I curve you into pieces of meat.

1074
01:30:15,333 --> 01:30:16,478
Motherfucker.

1075
01:30:18,356 --> 01:30:19,416
This is the moment!

1076
01:30:20,626 --> 01:30:24,648
The moment you hold my life in your hands!

1077
01:30:25,103 --> 01:30:26,728
We are confused.

1078
01:30:27,936 --> 01:30:29,042
Do it!

1079
01:30:29,811 --> 01:30:31,435
We have!

1080
01:30:33,895 --> 01:30:36,145
You talk too much, idiot.

1081
01:30:38,062 --> 01:30:41,833
You killed so many people and you still live?

1082
01:30:42,604 --> 01:30:43,562
That's why you should kill me.

1083
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,208
Try to die in silence.

1084
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:49,291
Because I'm going to make you suffer.

1085
01:31:31,187 --> 01:31:32,604
I'm sorry, bastard.

1086
01:31:35,042 --> 01:31:36,665
I'm still a policeman.

1087
01:31:57,096 --> 01:31:58,762
Nice to meet you, son of a bitch.

1088
01:32:03,563 --> 01:32:07,165
You are under arrest for murder.

1089
01:32:12,771 --> 01:32:14,665
Even a devil like you...

1090
01:32:16,001 --> 01:32:18,042
...you have the right to hire a lawyer.

1091
01:32:18,748 --> 01:32:21,748
You have the right to remain silent.

1092
01:32:22,561 --> 01:32:26,125
Everything you say...

1093
01:32:26,688 --> 01:32:29,167
...can be used against you in court.

1094
01:32:30,812 --> 01:32:33,021
If you can't afford a lawyer,

1095
01:32:33,915 --> 01:32:39,416
we'll use taxpayer money to help a piece of shit like you.

1096
01:32:54,687 --> 01:32:55,520
Who is that?

1097
01:32:56,354 --> 01:32:58,333
It is not obvious?

1098
01:32:58,437 --> 01:33:00,185
He is the serial killer.

1099
01:33:04,229 --> 01:33:05,459
What are you doing?

1100
01:33:05,605 --> 01:33:06,708
Come here.

1101
01:33:07,541 --> 01:33:08,707
Hurry up.

1102
01:33:10,685 --> 01:33:12,021
Come here, you son of a bitch.

1103
01:33:17,729 --> 01:33:21,707
In the September kidnapping investigation,

1104
01:33:21,812 --> 01:33:23,961
Cheonan City Police obtained

1105
01:33:24,161 --> 01:33:26,624
key evidence to catch the suspect.

1106
01:33:26,749 --> 01:33:30,124
He is currently receiving treatment for minor injuries,

1107
01:33:30,541 --> 01:33:31,881
after which you will be arrested,

1108
01:33:32,081 --> 01:33:35,687
and faced the charges in court.

1109
01:33:35,998 --> 01:33:37,041
In separate news,

1110
01:33:37,145 --> 01:33:41,312
the police have shut down numerous illegal casinos and gambling halls.

1111
01:33:41,521 --> 01:33:45,999
Authorities have linked them to various criminal organizations.

1112
01:33:46,748 --> 01:33:49,472
Police search for several gang leaders

1113
01:33:49,672 --> 01:33:51,186
in relation to the case.

1114
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:54,625
These organizations were making profits...

1115
01:33:54,687 --> 01:33:57,789
...because of modified slot machines,

1116
01:33:58,603 --> 01:34:01,104
in addition to other illegal activities.

1117
01:34:01,790 --> 01:34:04,915
The whereabouts of these individuals are currently unknown.

1118
01:34:07,813 --> 01:34:08,896
You did everything, right?

1119
01:34:10,853 --> 01:34:11,604
No.

1120
01:34:11,999 --> 01:34:15,726
First you convinced the world that he's the killer,

1121
01:34:15,727 --> 01:34:16,521
And now you say there is no evidence?!

1122
01:34:16,541 --> 01:34:19,374
It's just that most of our evidence is circumstantial.

1123
01:34:20,291 --> 01:34:21,896
We have no concrete evidence that he is the killer.

1124
01:34:22,096 --> 01:34:23,061
Even if I were the judge,

1125
01:34:24,083 --> 01:34:26,061
I could not convict him on this evidence.

1126
01:34:30,352 --> 01:34:31,290
What is this?

1127
01:34:31,541 --> 01:34:32,186
It's a knife.

1128
01:34:32,707 --> 01:34:36,102
The knife you used to kill your victims.

1129
01:34:38,748 --> 01:34:40,289
what are your life goals?

1130
01:34:41,019 --> 01:34:43,853
No matter how hard I try, I don't understand you.

1131
01:34:45,686 --> 01:34:47,374
Because you are not a human being.

1132
01:34:47,541 --> 01:34:49,206
So tell me about your goals.

1133
01:34:51,269 --> 01:34:54,269
Being a good policeman and a model citizen?

1134
01:34:55,915 --> 01:34:57,020
You don't have an answer, do you?

1135
01:34:57,957 --> 01:35:00,457
No one can live a life based on goals.

1136
01:35:01,622 --> 01:35:04,499
You just live your life the way you live it.

1137
01:35:07,688 --> 01:35:09,414
gloves are used,

1138
01:35:09,790 --> 01:35:12,666
because the knife is very slippery and doesn't go exactly where you want it to.

1139
01:35:13,354 --> 01:35:15,040
And the knife does not penetrate cleanly in a stab.

1140
01:35:16,957 --> 01:35:18,542
So when you stab someone,

1141
01:35:19,414 --> 01:35:21,247
you can feel it at your fingertips.

1142
01:35:22,790 --> 01:35:23,414
I think the killer thought so.

1143
01:35:26,250 --> 01:35:27,540
These photos.

1144
01:35:39,542 --> 01:35:40,042
That?

1145
01:35:41,457 --> 01:35:43,144
The order is wrong.

1146
01:35:46,376 --> 01:35:49,936
There is no evidence to show that I did.

1147
01:35:51,394 --> 01:35:54,979
And even if I were convicted,

1148
01:35:56,332 --> 01:35:57,623
You know I won't die anyway.

1149
01:36:04,414 --> 01:36:06,581
I'm going to kill him!

1150
01:36:10,748 --> 01:36:14,312
If you sentence me to death in the absence of evidence,

1151
01:36:16,124 --> 01:36:17,874
that's real murder!

1152
01:36:18,396 --> 01:36:20,998
The real demons are those who accuse

1153
01:36:21,198 --> 01:36:23,122
someone just because of their appearance.

1154
01:36:23,851 --> 01:36:26,435
As law makers, you must ask yourself...

1155
01:36:26,498 --> 01:36:28,812
...if you have any integrity.

1156
01:36:30,290 --> 01:36:31,872
If you are innocent

1157
01:36:33,831 --> 01:36:35,645
then me too!

1158
01:36:45,832 --> 01:36:47,498
You said you've never seen this knife?

1159
01:36:50,144 --> 01:36:51,143
That's right.

1160
01:36:51,310 --> 01:36:57,580
This knife was used to kill five victims.

1161
01:36:57,601 --> 01:36:59,082
Objection, your honor.

1162
01:36:59,457 --> 01:37:02,394
The prosecution has not provided any evidence in this trial...

1163
01:37:02,623 --> 01:37:05,082
...to prove that my client has had contact with that knife.

1164
01:37:05,395 --> 01:37:07,895
I'm not implying that the knife is yours.

1165
01:37:07,999 --> 01:37:08,769
Yes, you are right.

1166
01:37:10,351 --> 01:37:12,455
This knife had nothing to do with the defendant.

1167
01:37:13,331 --> 01:37:14,685
At least until now.

1168
01:37:15,790 --> 01:37:18,185
Your Honor, we're calling our next witness.

1169
01:37:20,436 --> 01:37:25,665
He is the only person who survived an encounter with the assailant.

1170
01:37:26,206 --> 01:37:27,454
Let the witness in.

1171
01:37:55,104 --> 01:37:57,914
You must have a death wish, coming to find me.

1172
01:37:58,156 --> 01:38:00,343
You look terrifying.

1173
01:38:03,687 --> 01:38:07,500
We pay taxes so you can convict those bastards, you idiot.

1174
01:38:08,414 --> 01:38:10,852
That is the law.

1175
01:38:11,498 --> 01:38:13,915
We arrest criminals

1176
01:38:14,871 --> 01:38:17,018
but we also have to protect their rights.

1177
01:38:17,790 --> 01:38:20,542
You son of a bitch, you should have let me kill him.

1178
01:38:25,936 --> 01:38:28,060
You are my last resort.

1179
01:38:28,103 --> 01:38:30,811
We are going to use the law to kill him.

1180
01:38:34,288 --> 01:38:35,894
What the fuck are you talking about?

1181
01:38:43,769 --> 01:38:44,726
Turn yourself in to the police.

1182
01:38:45,122 --> 01:38:47,893
Son of a bitch, you've gone crazy.

1183
01:38:51,561 --> 01:38:53,146
You killed Heo Sang-do?

1184
01:38:53,183 --> 01:38:54,435
Yes, I killed him.

1185
01:38:55,914 --> 01:38:57,228
Yes, I killed him.

1186
01:38:57,270 --> 01:38:58,435
Look at this bastard.

1187
01:38:59,521 --> 01:39:02,290
If you kill me, we'll both die.

1188
01:39:03,499 --> 01:39:05,936
Jang Dong-soo, don't make me wear this.

1189
01:39:07,707 --> 01:39:09,039
Give yourself up and testify.

1190
01:39:09,540 --> 01:39:10,935
You are the only witness.

1191
01:39:11,164 --> 01:39:15,206
Only you can link him to all those murders.

1192
01:39:16,270 --> 01:39:19,831
We are going to die together.

1193
01:39:21,226 --> 01:39:24,310
I swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth.

1194
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:28,164
So help me God.

1195
01:39:32,581 --> 01:39:33,394
Your Honor.

1196
01:39:33,790 --> 01:39:38,392
The witness for the prosecution is a gang leader.

1197
01:39:38,997 --> 01:39:41,081
He is charged with several felonies.

1198
01:39:41,281 --> 01:39:43,332
He is suspect in other cases.

1199
01:39:43,687 --> 01:39:46,437
But they have nothing to do with it.

1200
01:39:46,666 --> 01:39:47,435
I agree.

1201
01:39:48,373 --> 01:39:48,976
Witness.

1202
01:39:49,663 --> 01:39:54,185
How do you prove that the defendant was the one who attacked you?

1203
01:40:02,685 --> 01:40:04,893
People in my line of work...

1204
01:40:05,915 --> 01:40:09,039
...never forgets his enemies until the day he dies.

1205
01:40:10,684 --> 01:40:12,581
That's the bastard who stabbed me.

1206
01:40:13,956 --> 01:40:18,227
After he stabbed me,

1207
01:40:18,895 --> 01:40:21,226
I immediately made this robot portrait.

1208
01:40:24,519 --> 01:40:29,374
Your Honor, this is simply a drawing based on one man's opinion.

1209
01:40:29,437 --> 01:40:33,623
It cannot be considered as scientific or concrete evidence.

1210
01:40:33,665 --> 01:40:34,206
Your Honor.

1211
01:40:35,145 --> 01:40:38,831
These are the witness's hospital records,

1212
01:40:39,571 --> 01:40:41,621
as a result of the attack.

1213
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:43,746
The witness is a gang boss.

1214
01:40:43,809 --> 01:40:46,790
Stabbings are a daily occurrence for people like him.

1215
01:40:47,060 --> 01:40:50,478
We have no idea who caused those stab wounds.

1216
01:40:52,060 --> 01:40:54,894
Furthermore, we are violating my client's rights.

1217
01:40:55,124 --> 01:40:56,580
This son of a bitch talks too much.

1218
01:40:57,642 --> 01:40:58,539
Hey Mr. Lawyer...

1219
01:40:58,739 --> 01:40:58,977
Witness!

1220
01:40:59,623 --> 01:41:01,520
If your family were killed in the same way,

1221
01:41:01,603 --> 01:41:03,206
would you still say this shit?

1222
01:41:03,707 --> 01:41:05,185
Rights of your client?

1223
01:41:05,206 --> 01:41:07,165
That son of a bitch has no rights.

1224
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:10,600
That son of a bitch killed people for his own pleasure.

1225
01:41:11,247 --> 01:41:14,415
I may be a bad guy, but that bastard deserves to die.

1226
01:41:15,414 --> 01:41:16,102
Evidence?

1227
01:41:17,476 --> 01:41:18,686
I'll show you.

1228
01:41:29,582 --> 01:41:34,309
That night, he hit my car and forced me out.

1229
01:41:34,392 --> 01:41:37,352
He stabbed me twice in the side.

1230
01:41:38,102 --> 01:41:40,892
Then during the fight, he stabbed me in the chest.

1231
01:41:40,997 --> 01:41:45,413
I cut my fingers taking the knife away.

1232
01:41:47,079 --> 01:41:49,706
If I were an ordinary person, I would have died on the spot.

1233
01:41:51,352 --> 01:41:53,249
Take off his clothes.

1234
01:41:53,684 --> 01:41:55,261
I stabbed him in the left chest.

1235
01:41:55,461 --> 01:41:57,039
You should have a wound there.

1236
01:42:04,644 --> 01:42:07,643
If you check his hand, you will find many scars.

1237
01:42:08,039 --> 01:42:11,706
Knife killers will usually have a lot of scars on their hands.

1238
01:42:11,906 --> 01:42:13,080
They will also have damaged nails.

1239
01:42:14,623 --> 01:42:16,686
Finally...

1240
01:42:20,184 --> 01:42:21,767
That bastard wrote this.

1241
01:42:24,330 --> 01:42:26,476
Handwriting analysis will confirm a match.

1242
01:42:27,747 --> 01:42:29,977
Heo Sang-do was my friend.

1243
01:42:30,188 --> 01:42:33,185
"I used my knife to kill Heo Sang-do."

1244
01:42:33,748 --> 01:42:36,081
Sang-do and his deputy are dead.

1245
01:42:36,726 --> 01:42:38,558
I feel sorry for Oh-seung.

1246
01:42:39,267 --> 01:42:40,747
But this is the only way...

1247
01:42:41,727 --> 01:42:43,394
...to avenge his death.

1248
01:42:45,172 --> 01:42:47,724
"Someone used my knife to kill Heo Sang-do.

1249
01:42:49,166 --> 01:42:51,864
I used my knife to kill Heo Sang-do."

1250
01:42:52,475 --> 01:42:56,665
The defendant had an extremely violent contempt...

1251
01:42:57,705 --> 01:42:59,207
...for human life.

1252
01:43:01,548 --> 01:43:03,914
His victims suffered a great deal before they died.

1253
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:09,206
After weighing the impact of the defendant's crimes...

1254
01:43:11,089 --> 01:43:11,089
Thank my Lord.

1255
01:43:11,289 --> 01:43:14,081
...the defendant, Kang Kyeong-ho...

1256
01:43:16,498 --> 01:43:17,747
...is sentenced to death.

1257
01:43:28,727 --> 01:43:29,912
Turn around!

1258
01:43:32,184 --> 01:43:32,934
Greeting!

1259
01:43:50,768 --> 01:43:54,100
The boss is here! Come say hi!

1260
01:43:54,914 --> 01:43:56,601
Welcome boss!

1261
01:44:57,122 --> 01:44:57,891
I have a condition.

1262
01:44:59,029 --> 01:44:59,697
Which?

1263
01:45:00,391 --> 01:45:05,704
Put me in the same prison as him.

1264
01:45:29,456 --> 01:45:32,015
It's been a fun game

1265
01:45:32,016 --> 01:45:35,162
but it's game over.
