1
00:00:07,044 --> 00:00:12,007
BLOSSOM PICTURES and KTH present...

2
00:00:12,008 --> 00:00:16,930
...a production of GLOWFLY PICTURES and SEOUL ACTION SCHOOL:

3
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:32,366
Fist and Fury.

4
00:00:33,118 --> 00:00:35,704
Are you the cameraman of the Dongjin channel, Gook-hyun Nam?

5
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:38,999
They say out there that you are looking for an exclusive.

6
00:00:39,376 --> 00:00:41,711
They gave me a tip from the ostia, do you want it?

7
00:00:42,505 --> 00:00:45,257
It's about a crooked cop I lent money to multiple times,

8
00:00:46,551 --> 00:00:48,845
His name is Ki-man Kang.

9
00:00:49,972 --> 00:00:53,392
I'm Detective Kim, I need to ask you a favor.

10
00:00:55,354 --> 00:00:57,105
I need some dough.

11
00:00:57,106 --> 00:00:59,525
I'll return it to you in a week at the most.

12
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:02,821
Don't lie to me, Mr. Park.

13
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:07,034
I know your bar is doing well.

14
00:01:07,035 --> 00:01:09,830
Hey dick! Where's my fucking money?!

15
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,336
Do not say no to me! Hello?

16
00:01:15,755 --> 00:01:17,923
Hello? Hello?

17
00:01:22,596 --> 00:01:25,850
You bastard, pay me what you owe me and the interest this week!

18
00:01:25,851 --> 00:01:28,311
Or I fucking kill you!

19
00:01:33,318 --> 00:01:37,447
He was a high-class cop, only handled big cases.

20
00:01:37,615 --> 00:01:41,452
And then you got hooked on gambling while investigating a case?

21
00:01:41,662 --> 00:01:45,875
Exactly! She then got into trouble in a drug case.

22
00:01:47,085 --> 00:01:49,546
The drugs were cooked by a certain Tae-hwa Jung.

23
00:01:50,298 --> 00:01:53,718
A guy infamous for selling synthetic drugs in Gangnam.

24
00:01:53,844 --> 00:01:58,599
Kang shot him after he tried to stab him while high.

25
00:02:00,602 --> 00:02:03,396
I don't know who Jung's mole was,

26
00:02:03,397 --> 00:02:06,275
but found out what Kang was planning.

27
00:02:06,735 --> 00:02:09,237
Bird Crocodile.

28
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,200
Wow, first call in a year.

29
00:02:13,285 --> 00:02:17,122
I had heard that you had gone bankrupt on the stock market, from what I see, it is true.

30
00:02:18,917 --> 00:02:21,127
Are you coming to rob me?

31
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:24,882
Do cops these days do such base things?

32
00:02:25,091 --> 00:02:26,717
I understand.

33
00:02:26,718 --> 00:02:30,931
I'll send you a big one for giving me such an exclusive.

34
00:02:31,474 --> 00:02:34,519
Of course, it would be more, take care.

35
00:02:47,202 --> 00:02:48,453
Young-dae.

36
00:02:48,871 --> 00:02:52,166
That cop plans to rip off our shipment.

37
00:02:52,918 --> 00:02:57,255
Things got worse when a rookie was assigned as Kang's partner.

38
00:02:57,256 --> 00:02:59,759
You have a new rookie partner.

39
00:02:59,843 --> 00:03:01,594
Greetings! My name is Jae-ho Yoon!

40
00:03:03,556 --> 00:03:07,810
Detective Kang! Tomorrow is the deadline, don't be late!

41
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,689
What's that?

42
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:15,904
Detective Kang.

43
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:18,282
Do you remember me?

44
00:03:18,617 --> 00:03:23,455
The doorman of Gupabal's store from 5 years ago.

45
00:03:30,673 --> 00:03:33,092
Detective Kang, are you sure what's here?

46
00:03:33,093 --> 00:03:36,179
We don't have any orders, we could get in trouble.

47
00:03:40,102 --> 00:03:42,061
Open your eyes wide and observe, understand?

48
00:03:42,062 --> 00:03:45,858
Watch me slice off your ankle for not cooperating.

49
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:47,860
¡Cogedle!

50
00:03:51,783 --> 00:03:53,075
The police!

51
00:03:53,368 --> 00:03:55,078
It's a raid!

52
00:03:56,455 --> 00:03:57,873
The police!

53
00:04:09,953 --> 00:04:11,859
Let not one be left standing!

54
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,502
Surrender!

55
00:05:13,635 --> 00:05:15,386
Wait a moment.

56
00:05:15,387 --> 00:05:17,389
Detective...

57
00:05:17,724 --> 00:05:19,850
Thanks for saving me.

58
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:22,265
Detective,

59
00:05:22,594 --> 00:05:24,461
I can know his name?

60
00:05:24,487 --> 00:05:25,781
I promise to visit you.

61
00:05:25,806 --> 00:05:27,933
Get well first, jerk.

62
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:41,794
I stopped playing soccer after that injury.

63
00:05:41,795 --> 00:05:44,411
When I left the academy, I was working on patrol,

64
00:05:44,436 --> 00:05:47,814
until I found out where I was and asked to be transferred here.

65
00:05:50,418 --> 00:05:55,082
Detective Park said that you were the best police officer in Mapo.

66
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:57,012
Bullshit.

67
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:00,818
I lost my magic touch a long time ago.

68
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,573
So you'd better ask another partner.

69
00:06:13,335 --> 00:06:16,004
But I still want to learn from you.

70
00:06:16,005 --> 00:06:19,175
After all, I am a newbie, can you teach me?

71
00:06:28,813 --> 00:06:30,397
Say hello to dad!

72
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,648
You will be late?

73
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:33,276
Yes, surely.

74
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,112
Honey, say hello to Detective Ki-man Kang!

75
00:06:36,197 --> 00:06:37,739
Hello!

76
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,910
Are you free this Sunday?

77
00:06:42,037 --> 00:06:46,188
It's our girl's first birthday, come eat with us please.

78
00:06:46,268 --> 00:06:47,868
I'm sorry but I already have plans.

79
00:06:49,547 --> 00:06:51,840
- I will call you later! - Dear!

80
00:06:52,092 --> 00:06:54,510
She's a bit immature sometimes.

81
00:06:54,553 --> 00:06:57,280
Although I'm going to give him an invite just in case anyway.

82
00:06:57,461 --> 00:06:59,366
Eun-jae's first birthday!

83
00:07:10,907 --> 00:07:12,992
What are we doing here?

84
00:07:12,993 --> 00:07:16,162
I'll be back in a moment, stay here.

85
00:07:16,163 --> 00:07:18,207
Yes sir!

86
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,497
My girl...

87
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,668
Come here, buddy.

88
00:09:46,643 --> 00:09:48,061
¡Matadlo!

89
00:10:24,738 --> 00:10:26,175
Catch him! Come on!

90
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,519
Go Go!

91
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,506
Motherfucker!

92
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:03,897
bastard!

93
00:12:06,906 --> 00:12:08,281
Go dead!

94
00:12:19,764 --> 00:12:21,609
¡Detective Kang! ¡Detective Kang!

95
00:12:21,695 --> 00:12:22,859
¡Detective Kang!

96
00:12:25,633 --> 00:12:26,750
Let's go.

97
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,086
- There is! - There is!

98
00:12:36,146 --> 00:12:38,420
For them! Let them not escape!

99
00:12:39,687 --> 00:12:41,719
Come on, quickly escape!

100
00:12:41,836 --> 00:12:43,742
Go for them, let's go!

101
00:12:44,469 --> 00:12:46,258
- Go Go! - Come on!

102
00:12:46,283 --> 00:12:47,969
Stay there you bastard!

103
00:12:49,695 --> 00:12:51,094
You will find out!

104
00:12:52,376 --> 00:12:54,173
- Go Go! - Come on!

105
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:57,618
- Go dead! - You are already ours!

106
00:12:57,966 --> 00:13:00,676
Go away!

107
00:13:02,196 --> 00:13:04,063
Die bastard!

108
00:13:06,938 --> 00:13:08,618
- Go dead! - That the other escapes!

109
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:11,231
Cocoon!

110
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:43,146
His partner, Detective Yoon, was killed instantly.

111
00:13:43,147 --> 00:13:46,233
And Jung lost his prized lieutenant.

112
00:13:48,936 --> 00:13:50,673
Let's get out quick, come on!

113
00:13:50,698 --> 00:13:53,159
When the narcotics did their bust,

114
00:13:53,201 --> 00:13:55,537
Jung had long since left.

115
00:13:55,579 --> 00:13:59,458
- Find the switch! - Turn on the lights!

116
00:13:59,918 --> 00:14:02,253
We are fucked with milk! They are not here!

117
00:14:02,463 --> 00:14:04,131
Find the switch.

118
00:14:04,132 --> 00:14:05,382
You sons of bitches!

119
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:10,690
We don't even know how he's still alive, his condition is critical.

120
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:14,227
There is a very good chance that the cerebral artery has been damaged.

121
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:17,522
Could you lead a normal life in that case?

122
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,895
I'm not sure...

123
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:23,257
One thing I do know for sure, the knife has to stay inside his head.

124
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:25,741
Until the day he dies.

125
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:30,205
When I got to the scene of the crime, Jung had fled,

126
00:14:30,206 --> 00:14:32,750
and Yoon was dead.

127
00:14:32,751 --> 00:14:36,713
I found out they had been working together.

128
00:14:36,714 --> 00:14:38,841
You didn't know that, did you?

129
00:14:38,842 --> 00:14:42,220
Jung bought it when Yoon was a patrol officer.

130
00:14:42,221 --> 00:14:45,329
A bag full of money was found in Yoon's locker,

131
00:14:45,354 --> 00:14:49,107
We'll say he was killed while trying to steal Jung's drugs.

132
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,556
Who stabbed you, Detective Kang?

133
00:14:53,581 --> 00:14:56,118
Was it Detective Yoon or Tae-hwa Jung?

134
00:15:02,433 --> 00:15:04,226
Detective Jae-ho Yoon.

135
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,481
I am absolutely sure...

136
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,700
...which was Detective Yoon.

137
00:15:09,672 --> 00:15:11,674
Very good.

138
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,847
Mourning.

139
00:15:18,932 --> 00:15:21,553
Now that the investigation is over, let me be frank.

140
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,131
Detective,

141
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:25,774
Don't you think this is too much?

142
00:15:25,817 --> 00:15:30,155
Don't you think it's wrong to blame everything on Yoon with hardly any proof of anything?!

143
00:15:30,198 --> 00:15:31,114
Hey watch out!

144
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,240
You knew Jae-ho,

145
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,404
Do you think I would do such a thing?! Hey!

146
00:15:34,429 --> 00:15:36,115
All this is nothing but hoaxes!

147
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:36,959
Detective...

148
00:15:36,984 --> 00:15:39,643
...I'd throw him under a bus just because he's dead!

149
00:15:39,668 --> 00:15:40,334
Stop!

150
00:15:40,377 --> 00:15:42,115
Burying the case will not hide the truth!

151
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,506
- Let me go! - You know it better than anyone!

152
00:15:44,507 --> 00:15:45,925
Enough already, asshole!

153
00:15:45,926 --> 00:15:48,344
Dude, he died because of you.

154
00:15:48,345 --> 00:15:51,098
You got him on this team!

155
00:15:51,099 --> 00:15:52,850
How was I to know, you bastard?!

156
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:56,187
- You killed him, why did you do it?! - Stop saying bullshit, idiot!

157
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:57,689
How was I to know?!

158
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,676
He died because of you!

159
00:16:20,135 --> 00:16:22,416
Eun-jae's first birthday!

160
00:16:30,064 --> 00:16:31,166
Forgive me.

161
00:16:32,174 --> 00:16:34,721
I was on the edge of the abyss.

162
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,908
And when I fell

163
00:16:38,909 --> 00:16:40,806
the knife...

164
00:16:41,228 --> 00:16:42,939
...it didn't stay in my head,

165
00:16:43,845 --> 00:16:45,697
he did it in my heart.

166
00:16:49,171 --> 00:16:50,881
Can you manage?

167
00:16:50,882 --> 00:16:55,011
Don't worry about that, Mr. Counselor.

168
00:16:55,012 --> 00:16:57,472
Just give me Kang's address.

169
00:16:57,932 --> 00:17:00,726
This is the site.

170
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:06,108
This is where the man who has had a knife to his head for 3 years lives.

171
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:09,031
Now I'll ring the bell.

172
00:17:12,743 --> 00:17:16,538
I really want to see how it is.

173
00:17:26,176 --> 00:17:27,844
Hello?

174
00:17:29,764 --> 00:17:31,974
Is there someone at home?

175
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,209
I don't think there is anyone.

176
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:43,822
Where the hell did he go?

177
00:17:43,906 --> 00:17:47,535
No phone number or anything.

178
00:17:52,709 --> 00:17:55,557
Why do you keep insisting?

179
00:18:00,928 --> 00:18:02,262
Tell me, producer Hong.

180
00:18:02,263 --> 00:18:06,851
Nam, return the camera and empty your locker!

181
00:18:07,092 --> 00:18:09,303
He is taking it very brave.

182
00:18:09,328 --> 00:18:10,444
To the brave?

183
00:18:10,469 --> 00:18:12,974
With everything I've done for you over the years,

184
00:18:12,999 --> 00:18:15,319
and now he is not going to allow me a bad streak.

185
00:18:15,389 --> 00:18:16,756
The fall is always cruel.

186
00:18:16,781 --> 00:18:19,561
I have a great story on my hands!

187
00:18:19,586 --> 00:18:21,254
It's one of the good ones!

188
00:18:21,495 --> 00:18:24,164
- Fuck it's going to be. - It will be a bombshell!

189
00:18:24,165 --> 00:18:25,375
Do not lie to me.

190
00:18:27,641 --> 00:18:29,110
- Mrs. Hong. - That?

191
00:18:29,135 --> 00:18:33,259
It's about a guy with a knife in his head!

192
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,427
So is he dead?

193
00:18:34,428 --> 00:18:37,264
Bullshit, I'm going to interview him.

194
00:18:37,265 --> 00:18:38,735
- Oh really? - Yeah.

195
00:18:39,267 --> 00:18:43,021
I'll show you the recordings, I have to go.

196
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:44,313
Yeah.

197
00:18:45,025 --> 00:18:47,164
What a nuisance it is made...

198
00:18:49,363 --> 00:18:51,490
Holy shit! Oh my God!

199
00:18:51,491 --> 00:18:53,951
Have you come to see the man who lives here?

200
00:18:53,976 --> 00:18:55,336
Who the fuck are you?

201
00:18:55,955 --> 00:18:58,123
Take him to a shrink right away!

202
00:18:58,124 --> 00:19:01,706
He screams all night and breaks everything in sight!

203
00:19:02,505 --> 00:19:04,878
We dare not report it because we are all afraid of it!

204
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,160
Shit!

205
00:19:08,512 --> 00:19:09,346
Excuse me.

206
00:19:09,388 --> 00:19:10,847
- That man... - What the hell?

207
00:19:10,848 --> 00:19:12,141
How long has it been like this?

208
00:19:12,183 --> 00:19:14,560
Are you taxing me?

209
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,483
What when did it start? I'm not 100% sure,

210
00:19:19,484 --> 00:19:21,861
but it will be more or less a year, I think...

211
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:24,038
Fuck...

212
00:19:27,995 --> 00:19:29,579
Wait, is this Detective Ki-man Kang?

213
00:19:29,604 --> 00:19:30,956
Wait a moment!

214
00:19:30,957 --> 00:19:32,506
I'm Gook-hyu Nam,

215
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,812
Dongjin television reporter.

216
00:19:39,474 --> 00:19:40,771
What an asshole...

217
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,005
Detective Kang, detective Kang.

218
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:51,190
They told me that you have a knife lodged in your head,

219
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:54,152
what happened to him 3 years ago...?

220
00:20:01,912 --> 00:20:03,914
You son of a bitch!

221
00:20:10,199 --> 00:20:11,199
I shit on god!

222
00:20:12,676 --> 00:20:13,926
Motherfucker!

223
00:20:13,994 --> 00:20:16,072
I'm just doing my job!

224
00:20:16,222 --> 00:20:17,541
He just attacked me!

225
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:20,597
Dare to do the same to me now in the middle of the street!

226
00:20:21,061 --> 00:20:24,815
Come get me, come on, let's get this over with!

227
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,542
fucking shit...

228
00:20:42,838 --> 00:20:44,095
Show your face!

229
00:20:44,841 --> 00:20:46,572
Show your face, you chump asshole!

230
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,806
Get out of there, you piece of bastard!

231
00:20:50,807 --> 00:20:54,102
How do you have the balls to disrespect me like that?! Hey!

232
00:20:54,144 --> 00:20:56,142
You have embarrassed me in public.

233
00:21:02,947 --> 00:21:05,074
4, 5, 3, 2...

234
00:21:06,118 --> 00:21:09,120
You just found someone at your level, bastard.

235
00:21:17,507 --> 00:21:19,925
Unfortunate!

236
00:21:20,844 --> 00:21:22,387
What the fuck?

237
00:21:22,388 --> 00:21:23,972
What's happening?!

238
00:21:23,973 --> 00:21:25,307
What the hell is wrong with you?

239
00:21:25,308 --> 00:21:26,272
Are you OK?!

240
00:21:27,311 --> 00:21:28,412
Are you OK?!

241
00:21:28,437 --> 00:21:29,452
That?

242
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,566
That? This?

243
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:34,193
Do I hit you?

244
00:21:34,194 --> 00:21:36,029
Tell me the fucking time!

245
00:21:38,867 --> 00:21:40,743
Fuck you...

246
00:21:50,632 --> 00:21:52,103
I shit on god!

247
00:21:53,844 --> 00:21:55,521
Light up cunt!

248
00:22:04,524 --> 00:22:07,485
The holy fucking shit...

249
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:42,028
Call me.

250
00:22:52,834 --> 00:22:56,463
How did Detective Kang end up like this?

251
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,925
I had a rookie partner,

252
00:23:00,093 --> 00:23:02,011
his name was Jae-ho Yoon.

253
00:23:02,096 --> 00:23:06,308
He was working for a drug lord, and Detective Kang found out!

254
00:23:06,309 --> 00:23:08,311
When my husband was still alive,

255
00:23:08,312 --> 00:23:13,192
He prepared this video to show to all the birthday guests.

256
00:23:13,193 --> 00:23:18,157
Detective Ki-man Kang, thank you for coming to the party.

257
00:23:18,158 --> 00:23:24,832
I know that being a newbie, I will be a nuisance and a burden to you...

258
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:26,834
Please bear with me...

259
00:23:29,938 --> 00:23:33,415
Do you always go around instinctively punching?

260
00:23:34,428 --> 00:23:37,514
Lucky I can take a good spanking,

261
00:23:37,515 --> 00:23:39,850
you could have killed someone.

262
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:41,144
Are you North Korean?

263
00:23:41,145 --> 00:23:43,647
What does it matter where you are from?

264
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:47,500
Yes, it's been 15 years since I deserted and came here.

265
00:23:49,655 --> 00:23:51,865
Why did you desert?

266
00:23:52,617 --> 00:23:56,955
Yeah, that's something I've been wondering a lot lately too.

267
00:23:56,956 --> 00:23:59,291
I should have gone somewhere else.

268
00:23:59,292 --> 00:24:01,377
Do you have family?

269
00:24:10,974 --> 00:24:15,562
When did you start working on this?

270
00:24:16,898 --> 00:24:19,233
When I was 20 years old or so...

271
00:24:20,694 --> 00:24:23,613
I was working for a private detective agency.

272
00:24:23,865 --> 00:24:27,994
I was dedicated to discovering adventures.

273
00:24:27,995 --> 00:24:32,166
I did this and that until I ended up in this.

274
00:24:32,167 --> 00:24:37,506
My life deserves a documentary series of at least 5 chapters.

275
00:24:38,633 --> 00:24:41,820
Why am I opening up to you now?

276
00:24:43,681 --> 00:24:45,850
We have already arrived, it is here.

277
00:24:46,727 --> 00:24:48,102
- Thank you. - Bye bye.

278
00:24:48,145 --> 00:24:51,523
- Come see me again, please! - OK!

279
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:08,169
I'm scared for Eun-jae.

280
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:10,437
I don't want you to remember him as a bad guy.

281
00:25:10,462 --> 00:25:12,130
Do you want me to record you?

282
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,547
You know what really happened, right?

283
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:23,807
What people say

284
00:25:24,072 --> 00:25:25,736
it's all a lie,

285
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:27,338
TRUE?

286
00:25:30,114 --> 00:25:31,549
I know it's hard

287
00:25:32,167 --> 00:25:34,025
but try to forget it all at once.

288
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:37,789
How do you want me to do it when he died that way?

289
00:25:37,832 --> 00:25:39,713
I know someone...

290
00:25:41,253 --> 00:25:43,505
...will end up telling me the truth...

291
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:56,229
Didn't you find that girl adorable?

292
00:25:56,272 --> 00:25:59,900
It would have been nice if you had hugged her.

293
00:25:59,901 --> 00:26:04,211
It would have been a bit cute, but deep down it's what people want.

294
00:26:06,118 --> 00:26:07,660
Come on...

295
00:26:07,661 --> 00:26:10,118
I just feel bad for not having done it.

296
00:26:11,791 --> 00:26:13,508
Where are you going?!

297
00:26:15,129 --> 00:26:17,673
I had a feeling you'd be here.

298
00:26:17,715 --> 00:26:20,718
You should forget about this.

299
00:26:20,928 --> 00:26:26,475
If one wants to live well in Korea, one must learn to forget quickly.

300
00:26:28,521 --> 00:26:32,566
Do you still want to do a story on me?

301
00:26:33,694 --> 00:26:36,029
Well of course I want to.

302
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:40,034
Then start recording from now on.

303
00:26:42,788 --> 00:26:45,708
Why all of a sudden so much generosity?

304
00:26:46,418 --> 00:26:48,837
It will be a pleasure for me.

305
00:26:49,922 --> 00:26:50,906
And,

306
00:26:50,953 --> 00:26:52,523
the camera is already recording,

307
00:26:52,813 --> 00:26:54,445
Do you want to say something?

308
00:26:55,855 --> 00:26:57,398
I'm going after that bastard.

309
00:26:58,642 --> 00:27:00,992
I'm going to make him confess...

310
00:27:01,017 --> 00:27:03,359
...and let it come out of his own mouth that Jae-ho Yoon...

311
00:27:03,547 --> 00:27:05,683
...I had no relationship with him.

312
00:27:05,789 --> 00:27:09,863
I want everything I say to be recorded on your camera...

313
00:27:09,906 --> 00:27:11,351
...and show it to your family,

314
00:27:12,485 --> 00:27:14,375
so that I can apologize for everything.

315
00:27:16,914 --> 00:27:19,792
Where is Jung now?

316
00:27:19,793 --> 00:27:22,462
I'll have to start looking for it.

317
00:27:23,339 --> 00:27:25,049
Hang on a minute.

318
00:27:26,385 --> 00:27:27,493
Good.

319
00:27:27,822 --> 00:27:29,431
I'll need some kind of payment...

320
00:27:30,767 --> 00:27:33,158
...for taking so much risk.

321
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:43,613
Give me your bank account number.

322
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,434
¡Detective Kang!

323
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:10,147
Who is that?

324
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:12,983
Someone who's going to help me find Jung.

325
00:28:14,153 --> 00:28:15,862
Do you have the documents?

326
00:28:15,905 --> 00:28:16,947
Oh sure.

327
00:28:16,948 --> 00:28:20,451
Due to my transfer to homicide, the only Jung report I have,

328
00:28:20,452 --> 00:28:22,454
It's over a year old.

329
00:28:22,538 --> 00:28:25,958
Yeah? Well, it will have to work for us.

330
00:28:25,959 --> 00:28:27,710
Call me when you find it, please.

331
00:28:27,711 --> 00:28:29,713
I'll try to cover your back.

332
00:28:30,298 --> 00:28:31,715
Take care of yourself.

333
00:28:36,973 --> 00:28:38,682
Who are those girls?

334
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:41,144
They are overdosed on Jung's drugs.

335
00:28:41,145 --> 00:28:44,439
That guy is a real bastard.

336
00:28:44,649 --> 00:28:48,152
So they used them for medical tests?

337
00:28:48,153 --> 00:28:50,781
Masseurs, whores, escorts, etc.

338
00:28:50,782 --> 00:28:53,826
They caught anyone who urgently needed money.

339
00:28:53,827 --> 00:28:56,077
First they tested the effects of the drugs with them,

340
00:28:56,475 --> 00:28:58,061
...and then sold.

341
00:29:01,712 --> 00:29:04,172
Wait wait.

342
00:29:07,386 --> 00:29:08,776
Let's start the recording.

343
00:29:08,949 --> 00:29:12,644
I really want to know how Detective Kang is going to investigate this case.

344
00:29:13,477 --> 00:29:15,002
Where will it start?

345
00:29:17,604 --> 00:29:18,893
By Seol-ran Choi,

346
00:29:19,003 --> 00:29:20,831
I'll have to find her first.

347
00:29:40,928 --> 00:29:43,555
Did you have any reservation?

348
00:29:43,806 --> 00:29:44,973
have.

349
00:29:45,684 --> 00:29:49,312
Choose the one you want to kiss.

350
00:29:49,313 --> 00:29:54,318
People like you tend to pick girls in high school uniforms.

351
00:29:55,654 --> 00:29:56,738
Seol-ran.

352
00:29:56,781 --> 00:29:58,265
Bring me that one.

353
00:29:58,324 --> 00:29:59,909
That? Bring it to you?

354
00:29:59,952 --> 00:30:00,910
what the fuck?

355
00:30:02,455 --> 00:30:04,957
Shit, I didn't record it!

356
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:18,724
Other times...

357
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:20,852
Who are you?

358
00:30:20,853 --> 00:30:24,231
Song-hwa Han, did he ever call you?

359
00:30:25,317 --> 00:30:27,276
Never.

360
00:30:28,988 --> 00:30:31,407
Why are you looking for it?

361
00:30:31,449 --> 00:30:33,451
Why are you after my sister?!

362
00:30:37,373 --> 00:30:40,209
You're not going to get out of the car, are you?

363
00:30:42,797 --> 00:30:46,425
Is she deaf or what the hell is wrong with her?

364
00:30:46,426 --> 00:30:48,970
Please start now.

365
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:53,100
Apparently I'm an Uber driver now, that's what I am.

366
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,729
Where shall I take you, Mr. Kang?

367
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:57,731
To the Wonil district.

368
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:01,569
Oh yeah.

369
00:31:01,946 --> 00:31:02,946
Put this on.

370
00:31:02,947 --> 00:31:04,364
In case I forget to record something.

371
00:31:04,365 --> 00:31:05,491
Fuck off.

372
00:31:05,492 --> 00:31:07,493
Damn I need to record!

373
00:31:11,624 --> 00:31:13,709
Shit!

374
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:23,138
- Drink everyone! - Yes Boss!

375
00:31:23,139 --> 00:31:24,473
How adorable!

376
00:31:24,474 --> 00:31:26,809
Go make me some meat, jerk.

377
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:27,727
Of course!

378
00:31:30,106 --> 00:31:31,565
I'm so fed up...

379
00:31:36,364 --> 00:31:38,323
What's in here?

380
00:31:40,494 --> 00:31:42,078
What are you looking for?

381
00:31:42,788 --> 00:31:45,332
Don't rummage through my things!

382
00:31:46,627 --> 00:31:48,419
Open the trunk.

383
00:31:49,338 --> 00:31:51,715
I'm not your fucking slave.

384
00:31:54,803 --> 00:31:56,471
What's happening?

385
00:32:00,727 --> 00:32:04,356
Shit, he loves to pretend he's not there.

386
00:32:11,992 --> 00:32:13,868
Where are you going?!

387
00:32:13,869 --> 00:32:16,413
Going with your instincts again?!

388
00:32:17,665 --> 00:32:19,875
What a fucking used car shit!

389
00:32:21,128 --> 00:32:22,713
Stay here.

390
00:32:23,543 --> 00:32:24,543
Douchebag...**********************

391
00:32:25,175 --> 00:32:26,968
Who's there?

392
00:32:27,177 --> 00:32:29,155
Who are you?

393
00:32:29,292 --> 00:32:30,889
What are you doing here...?

394
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:32,674
Son of a big bitch!

395
00:32:32,699 --> 00:32:34,299
- Go get him! Come on! - Come on!

396
00:32:55,194 --> 00:32:56,874
Do not be afraid. Go get him.

397
00:33:05,058 --> 00:33:06,392
bastard!

398
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,223
But what the hell?!

399
00:33:57,373 --> 00:33:58,848
Speaks.

400
00:33:59,395 --> 00:34:01,216
Where is Jung?

401
00:34:03,256 --> 00:34:07,845
He's gone to fuck your fucking motherfucker, you fucking asshole!

402
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:21,820
Don't know!

403
00:34:23,322 --> 00:34:25,658
Last chance, spit it out, come on.

404
00:34:29,246 --> 00:34:31,081
Where is my sister?

405
00:34:31,082 --> 00:34:33,125
Stop! Please!

406
00:34:33,126 --> 00:34:35,420
He went to Heuksan, Heuksan Island!

407
00:34:35,421 --> 00:34:37,422
So that?

408
00:34:37,674 --> 00:34:39,759
To take the piro.

409
00:34:39,926 --> 00:34:43,346
Those who get addicted to their shit...

410
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:46,475
...they completely lose control of everything.

411
00:34:48,479 --> 00:34:53,752
It turns out that the son of a police chief, has become an addict.

412
00:34:54,236 --> 00:34:57,266
So he's got the major crime departments after him.

413
00:34:57,291 --> 00:35:00,518
That's why he's trying to leave the country.

414
00:35:11,716 --> 00:35:13,759
When do we go?

415
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:17,825
Hey dude, are you really a cop?

416
00:35:18,892 --> 00:35:20,521
Look what he's done.

417
00:35:21,006 --> 00:35:22,724
He's a cop, but he's a tough guy.

418
00:35:26,151 --> 00:35:27,860
Where is Moko?

419
00:35:27,861 --> 00:35:29,863
in there

420
00:35:30,281 --> 00:35:32,480
Detective Kang, shall I accompany you?

421
00:35:35,371 --> 00:35:37,238
Get busy locking up Mok.

422
00:35:42,964 --> 00:35:45,174
Ask me for help at any time.

423
00:35:54,937 --> 00:35:55,979
Hey you.

424
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:59,066
You must have made out with at least a thousand guys.

425
00:35:59,568 --> 00:36:01,527
What does it matter to you?

426
00:36:01,528 --> 00:36:05,616
Do you want to kiss someone you just met?

427
00:36:05,617 --> 00:36:09,538
You've never kissed anyone, have you?

428
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:11,540
Do you want to do it?

429
00:36:13,085 --> 00:36:16,087
If you pay me, I'll give you a kiss.

430
00:36:18,466 --> 00:36:22,429
The very slut is fucking me making fun of me.

431
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,640
That?

432
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:26,851
Are you North Korean?

433
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:29,521
And?

434
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:33,693
What's so fucking important about that?

435
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,699
I shit on god...

436
00:36:40,953 --> 00:36:43,371
I was looking for my sister.

437
00:36:43,372 --> 00:36:46,083
That was the last place he worked.

438
00:36:46,084 --> 00:36:50,172
Idiot, did you think you were going to find her like this?

439
00:36:50,173 --> 00:36:54,510
What was I supposed to do? Nobody wanted to help me.

440
00:36:55,763 --> 00:37:00,643
The world is so fucked up, no one ever helps anyone!

441
00:37:24,674 --> 00:37:28,636
All right, I'll give you half the package.

442
00:37:29,889 --> 00:37:32,349
Yes of course.

443
00:37:33,811 --> 00:37:37,522
Boss, are you really planning to go to China?

444
00:37:40,569 --> 00:37:44,156
Kang is coming to Heuksan.

445
00:37:44,157 --> 00:37:46,158
He thinks to kill me.

446
00:37:46,618 --> 00:37:49,287
And? He is afraid?

447
00:37:49,872 --> 00:37:54,460
It's actually perfect, I wanted to see it again one last time.

448
00:37:54,461 --> 00:37:59,300
I have to get back the half of my knife that's still stuck in his head.

449
00:37:59,301 --> 00:38:02,470
I'm curious to see how it is.

450
00:38:02,471 --> 00:38:04,848
What's so special about that knife?

451
00:38:05,308 --> 00:38:07,977
My mother's whore...

452
00:38:08,771 --> 00:38:12,691
...cut her wrists because she was a drug addict.

453
00:38:13,527 --> 00:38:15,612
Precisely, with that knife.

454
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:24,540
While I was alive, her pimp was beating me every day, so I ran away to Mokpo.

455
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:26,542
I would be about 13 years old.

456
00:38:27,628 --> 00:38:31,340
I told myself that I would never come back to Heuksan.

457
00:38:31,341 --> 00:38:37,681
How I hate those fucking Chinese for making me come back to this shitty place.

458
00:38:37,932 --> 00:38:39,266
Gil-ju.

459
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:40,309
Yes Boss.

460
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:44,147
Tell the captain to round up a few good men,

461
00:38:44,232 --> 00:38:46,192
and send them for Kang as a housewarming gift.

462
00:38:46,193 --> 00:38:47,860
Right now I do.

463
00:38:50,531 --> 00:38:54,285
It looks like he's not coming alone.

464
00:40:05,959 --> 00:40:08,753
What happen?

465
00:40:09,922 --> 00:40:13,009
Is this how cops investigate?

466
00:40:13,135 --> 00:40:15,428
It's so rudimentary...

467
00:40:27,444 --> 00:40:29,863
Do you want me to buy you one?

468
00:40:30,573 --> 00:40:32,324
What you want.

469
00:40:33,577 --> 00:40:36,827
Why do you spend all fucking day looking at it if you're not going to buy it?

470
00:40:37,916 --> 00:40:39,458
Do you only know how to swear?

471
00:40:39,459 --> 00:40:41,920
Say one more in front of me again, and I'll fucking kill you.

472
00:40:46,718 --> 00:40:49,499
It has made me remember the one my sister bought me!

473
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,639
Are you real sisters? How did you meet?

474
00:40:57,982 --> 00:41:01,038
When I arrived at the orphanage, the other children would not stop teasing me.

475
00:41:01,123 --> 00:41:04,545
They beat me, tripped me, and pulled my hair all day.

476
00:41:07,327 --> 00:41:10,163
He told me to blow it every time they did something to me.

477
00:41:10,915 --> 00:41:13,709
He bought it for me exactly for that.

478
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,424
I still have it at home.

479
00:41:27,603 --> 00:41:30,230
Like a little.

480
00:41:32,359 --> 00:41:35,111
Get all you want.

481
00:41:35,112 --> 00:41:40,076
I know you loved my mother's chicken soup.

482
00:41:47,586 --> 00:41:50,981
You could eat chicken thanks to the money my mother made prostituting herself.

483
00:41:51,007 --> 00:41:52,341
It was good?

484
00:41:52,717 --> 00:41:55,345
Tell me, how was he?

485
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,098
It was good?

486
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,893
Was she fucking mother?!

487
00:42:03,564 --> 00:42:05,733
Crippled fucking.

488
00:42:08,904 --> 00:42:12,482
Something smells good in here! I already have a sample ready!

489
00:42:17,165 --> 00:42:18,540
How are you doing?

490
00:42:18,708 --> 00:42:22,128
Shit this lazy won't impress the fucking Chinese.

491
00:42:22,129 --> 00:42:24,965
You'll know when you try it.

492
00:42:28,971 --> 00:42:30,806
Motherfucker!

493
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,268
Fucking scum!

494
00:42:37,732 --> 00:42:39,400
I'm sorry!

495
00:42:49,664 --> 00:42:51,290
¿Detective Park?

496
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:55,462
I am on Heuksan Island.

497
00:42:57,382 --> 00:43:00,301
It's not going to be easy, but I have to try anyway.

498
00:43:00,302 --> 00:43:03,972
Yeah.

499
00:43:05,642 --> 00:43:08,812
I'll call you if I need backup.

500
00:43:13,902 --> 00:43:16,238
Sir, are you alright?

501
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:18,949
- He is sick? - Leave it alone.

502
00:43:23,164 --> 00:43:25,541
What's the matter?

503
00:43:25,876 --> 00:43:28,753
The headache again?

504
00:43:28,838 --> 00:43:30,380
Are you okay?

505
00:43:30,381 --> 00:43:33,301
Dude, you're sick, right?

506
00:43:34,094 --> 00:43:37,681
He has a knife stuck in his head.

507
00:43:37,682 --> 00:43:39,475
That?

508
00:43:42,104 --> 00:43:44,314
Are you OK?

509
00:43:56,497 --> 00:43:59,041
Why did Jung kill Detective Yoon?

510
00:43:59,084 --> 00:44:00,960
You said they weren't related.

511
00:44:00,961 --> 00:44:03,255
I have already explained to you that he died trying to save him!

512
00:44:03,256 --> 00:44:04,882
So he died because of you.

513
00:44:04,883 --> 00:44:06,717
TRUE?

514
00:44:08,095 --> 00:44:11,265
Will you kill Jung when you find him?

515
00:44:11,683 --> 00:44:13,893
We will both die.

516
00:44:15,396 --> 00:44:18,857
What are you saying? You can't die!

517
00:44:19,693 --> 00:44:23,488
You have to survive and return to Seoul.

518
00:44:23,489 --> 00:44:28,051
I have to record how they examine you in the hospital!

519
00:44:28,121 --> 00:44:31,457
Today's audience is very touchy and they all think they are experts.

520
00:44:31,458 --> 00:44:34,961
No one will believe the knife if I don't offer proof!

521
00:44:34,962 --> 00:44:37,965
So we'll have to x-ray you,

522
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:40,301
and interview the doctor who does it.

523
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:45,307
Then we would end with a shot of your face with piano music in the background...

524
00:44:47,269 --> 00:44:49,813
If you're done, on your feet, let's go.

525
00:44:52,526 --> 00:44:55,028
Damn, I'm going to be invisible until the end.

526
00:44:58,158 --> 00:45:00,243
You fucking bastard!

527
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,203
Hey!

528
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:05,165
No passing.

529
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:38,165
Do you have any free room?

530
00:45:52,267 --> 00:45:53,267
Granny,

531
00:45:53,268 --> 00:45:55,937
why clean that jar so conscientiously?

532
00:45:55,938 --> 00:45:58,607
Because it will bring luck to all of us.

533
00:45:59,151 --> 00:46:02,779
Soon, that hostel will be mine.

534
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:07,577
And all because I will have cleaned it perfectly.

535
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:09,162
I understand.

536
00:46:14,503 --> 00:46:17,589
Are there any Chinese ships anchored in Heuksan?

537
00:46:17,882 --> 00:46:19,592
None.

538
00:46:19,634 --> 00:46:22,888
Normally some arrive when there is a storm.

539
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:40,743
Seol-ran...

540
00:46:40,953 --> 00:46:43,330
You do not have family?

541
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,250
They all left.

542
00:46:48,128 --> 00:46:49,796
Don't you miss them?

543
00:46:49,797 --> 00:46:52,091
I stopped feeling anything a long time ago.

544
00:46:52,092 --> 00:46:55,060
You can't stop feeling.

545
00:46:55,846 --> 00:46:59,517
It is not something that can be lost from one day to the next.

546
00:46:59,518 --> 00:47:03,230
You feel it in here, it's like an instinct.

547
00:47:10,657 --> 00:47:12,449
Where are you going now?

548
00:47:23,756 --> 00:47:27,093
Well, I've gotten used to being an invisible man.

549
00:48:03,097 --> 00:48:04,348
Take.

550
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:09,479
If you run into Kang, don't hesitate.

551
00:48:48,195 --> 00:48:49,988
Who are those bastards?

552
00:49:19,401 --> 00:49:20,985
Shit, we're screwed...

553
00:49:24,157 --> 00:49:25,783
Where are you going?

554
00:49:25,784 --> 00:49:28,161
Stay here.

555
00:49:28,329 --> 00:49:29,538
I will go with you!

556
00:49:29,539 --> 00:49:31,540
Stay here, I said!

557
00:49:34,294 --> 00:49:36,922
Outside is... it's dangerous.

558
00:49:37,723 --> 00:49:38,973
It does not matter.

559
00:49:39,544 --> 00:49:40,761
Take.

560
00:49:40,786 --> 00:49:42,850
I bought it just in case.

561
00:49:43,222 --> 00:49:44,932
Whistle with him if there is an emergency.

562
00:49:44,933 --> 00:49:46,315
Want you to know...

563
00:49:46,792 --> 00:49:48,549
...that when I asked you...

564
00:49:48,574 --> 00:49:50,378
...about the kiss in the car...

565
00:49:57,088 --> 00:49:58,487
I was a fucking immature

566
00:49:58,534 --> 00:50:01,559
You know, I behaved like an asshole,

567
00:50:01,584 --> 00:50:03,635
I beg your pardon, I'm sorry.

568
00:50:06,293 --> 00:50:08,711
This is very embarrassing for me...

569
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,347
¡Detective Kang!

570
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:20,643
You can't believe it, where have you been?

571
00:50:20,644 --> 00:50:21,936
¡Detective Kang!

572
00:50:21,937 --> 00:50:23,063
¡Detective!

573
00:50:23,064 --> 00:50:26,525
Why does he always have to do everything solo?

574
00:52:00,435 --> 00:52:02,270
Who has ordered you to come for me?

575
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,555
Where the hell has he gone?

576
00:54:01,584 --> 00:54:03,443
Get off me, bastard!

577
00:54:03,787 --> 00:54:04,928
Take!

578
00:54:25,951 --> 00:54:27,452
What's happening?

579
00:54:27,453 --> 00:54:29,746
Hold on, let me see, where do you have your medicine?!

580
00:54:29,747 --> 00:54:31,915
Where's your medicine?!

581
00:54:41,595 --> 00:54:43,221
Hold on, it's nothing!

582
00:54:43,264 --> 00:54:44,556
I'm here, don't worry!

583
00:54:44,599 --> 00:54:46,976
Because it does not work?!

584
00:54:47,227 --> 00:54:48,853
Come on!

585
00:54:48,896 --> 00:54:50,021
Because it does not work?!

586
00:54:50,648 --> 00:54:51,690
It's okay, hold on.

587
00:54:51,691 --> 00:54:54,694
It's nothing, okay? You will get over this!

588
00:54:54,695 --> 00:54:56,905
You just have to hold on a bit!

589
00:54:57,156 --> 00:54:58,949
Everything is alright.

590
00:55:13,635 --> 00:55:15,136
Are you there?

591
00:55:16,373 --> 00:55:18,270
One of my men will bring you the merchandise,

592
00:55:18,295 --> 00:55:20,420
as soon as I'm done with Kang.

593
00:55:21,733 --> 00:55:23,256
Do not be late.

594
00:56:21,261 --> 00:56:22,888
Are you okay?

595
00:56:28,687 --> 00:56:31,356
Why did you go off alone again?

596
00:56:41,526 --> 00:56:42,874
Tell me something.

597
00:56:43,164 --> 00:56:45,374
Has it been Jung who has sent these guys?

598
00:56:46,752 --> 00:56:49,504
Thanks for earlier.

599
00:56:55,638 --> 00:56:58,241
Are you going to tell me now that you know how to thank someone?

600
00:57:38,358 --> 00:57:40,860
Take care of Seol-ran.

601
00:57:59,676 --> 00:58:03,555
Why did you take so long to reply?!

602
00:58:05,266 --> 00:58:08,061
Take the merchandise to the lighthouse.

603
00:58:08,062 --> 00:58:11,315
If you don't show up there in an hour, I'll have you arrested.

604
00:58:11,399 --> 00:58:13,276
Understood?

605
00:58:18,992 --> 00:58:20,409
¿Mok?

606
00:58:22,371 --> 00:58:26,167
They found his body inside a container in Paju.

607
00:58:26,168 --> 00:58:30,088
Died from gas inhalation or something like that.

608
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:33,759
Detective Park was the one who found it.

609
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:38,223
Feed that bitch and come back, don't mess around with her!

610
00:58:38,224 --> 00:58:41,352
Will you stop calling her a slut at some point?!

611
00:58:41,353 --> 00:58:44,356
She has a name, it's Song-hwa.

612
00:58:44,357 --> 00:58:48,820
Jung said he's going to leave it lying here when he takes off for China.

613
00:58:48,821 --> 00:58:51,771
So I'll keep it to myself.

614
00:58:53,285 --> 00:58:54,744
Just so you know.

615
00:58:54,745 --> 00:58:56,538
- You fucking bastard! - That hurt!

616
00:58:56,539 --> 00:59:00,376
Jung has already taken all the juice out of it, how can you still like it?

617
00:59:00,377 --> 00:59:03,088
Take all his things to the warehouse!

618
00:59:03,089 --> 00:59:04,631
Don't touch them!

619
00:59:04,632 --> 00:59:05,817
If you touch them

620
00:59:05,842 --> 00:59:08,037
I will burn all this!

621
00:59:53,110 --> 00:59:55,111
Identity card.

622
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:13,467
Gui-su!

623
01:00:13,468 --> 01:00:15,470
Take the drink to the kitchen.

624
01:00:23,356 --> 01:00:26,442
I have left the truck running.

625
01:00:48,554 --> 01:00:50,180
The sacred host...

626
01:00:50,181 --> 01:00:52,182
Watch out!

627
01:00:52,183 --> 01:00:54,185
¡Eh! ¡Eh!

628
01:01:00,694 --> 01:01:02,028
Shit...

629
01:01:55,972 --> 01:01:58,724
And now what happens to this?

630
01:01:59,059 --> 01:02:01,185
What the fuck is wrong with him?!

631
01:02:08,445 --> 01:02:09,905
Very good...

632
01:02:14,161 --> 01:02:15,912
Answer, answer...

633
01:02:15,997 --> 01:02:18,082
- Answer... - The number you're calling...

634
01:02:18,291 --> 01:02:20,793
I can not believe it.

635
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:24,339
I shit on god!

636
01:02:29,722 --> 01:02:31,640
Am I talking to the Mokpo police?

637
01:02:32,225 --> 01:02:35,270
I'm in...

638
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:43,020
Detective Kang, why are you...?

639
01:02:43,114 --> 01:02:47,452
So in the end it was you who was in cahoots with Jung.

640
01:02:48,579 --> 01:02:50,793
What do you mean?

641
01:02:54,468 --> 01:02:56,971
Kill Kang and then Jung.

642
01:02:56,996 --> 01:03:00,134
Half of the merchandise for you and the rest for me.

643
01:03:00,135 --> 01:03:01,970
Fucking middling thug.

644
01:03:01,995 --> 01:03:05,367
Were you going to stab Jung in the back and take his merchandise?

645
01:03:16,906 --> 01:03:18,157
Fuck...

646
01:03:18,357 --> 01:03:20,804
You have screwed all my plans.

647
01:03:20,859 --> 01:03:23,246
I was going to keep his merchandise.

648
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:15,103
Stupid arm shit...

649
01:04:59,470 --> 01:05:00,470
Dime.

650
01:05:00,761 --> 01:05:02,137
Yes, it's me, how are you doing?

651
01:05:03,559 --> 01:05:05,231
Are you ready? Perfect.

652
01:05:07,301 --> 01:05:09,379
Boss, they're at the assembly point.

653
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:11,006
Is there any word on Jong-do?

654
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:12,132
No not yet.

655
01:05:12,133 --> 01:05:14,886
Shall we take Song-hwa with us?

656
01:05:14,887 --> 01:05:18,507
They won't give us any ships if we don't try the drug first.

657
01:05:25,246 --> 01:05:27,289
Gui-su!

658
01:05:30,406 --> 01:05:32,882
Véndeme a Song-hwa.

659
01:05:39,501 --> 01:05:42,587
I can pay you whatever you want.

660
01:05:42,588 --> 01:05:44,464
Véndemela.

661
01:05:44,465 --> 01:05:46,717
I will give you a lot of money!

662
01:05:46,718 --> 01:05:50,180
You don't need to raise your voice.

663
01:05:54,395 --> 01:05:57,272
Could...

664
01:05:57,273 --> 01:06:00,318
...fuck her just once?

665
01:06:02,822 --> 01:06:05,157
Fuck you...

666
01:06:29,947 --> 01:06:31,529
¡Song-hwa! ¡Song-hwa!

667
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:32,554
¡Song-hwa!

668
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:34,837
Sister!

669
01:06:34,862 --> 01:06:35,528
¡Song-hwa!

670
01:06:36,045 --> 01:06:37,006
It's you?

671
01:06:37,031 --> 01:06:38,389
¿Seol-ran?

672
01:07:07,826 --> 01:07:09,764
What the hell happened here?!

673
01:07:10,657 --> 01:07:12,575
Has the clamp gone?!

674
01:07:12,967 --> 01:07:15,036
You fucking cripple...

675
01:07:15,037 --> 01:07:17,061
Boss! Song-hwa has run away!

676
01:07:17,086 --> 01:07:19,389
- The bitch... - Don't stay there and go look for her, damn it!

677
01:07:24,716 --> 01:07:26,174
Get up sister!

678
01:07:38,858 --> 01:07:40,068
Take this, go!

679
01:07:40,093 --> 01:07:41,311
- No go away!

680
01:07:41,336 --> 01:07:42,336
Quiet bitches!

681
01:07:42,361 --> 01:07:44,053
Leave at once!

682
01:07:54,044 --> 01:07:55,528
Where has it gone?

683
01:08:53,243 --> 01:08:55,161
¡Song-hwa!

684
01:09:00,252 --> 01:09:02,212
¡Song-hwa!

685
01:09:11,099 --> 01:09:12,981
¡Song-hwa! ¡Song-hwa!

686
01:09:13,521 --> 01:09:15,817
Come with me, we'll leave here together.

687
01:09:42,555 --> 01:09:43,597
¡Seol-ran!

688
01:09:49,313 --> 01:09:50,188
No...

689
01:09:52,692 --> 01:09:54,318
Come here!

690
01:09:55,446 --> 01:09:57,698
You fucking pervert!

691
01:10:34,244 --> 01:10:35,328
Because?

692
01:10:35,533 --> 01:10:36,575
Because?!

693
01:10:36,724 --> 01:10:37,782
For!

694
01:11:13,043 --> 01:11:14,878
Hey! Wake up!

695
01:11:14,879 --> 01:11:16,880
Are you OK? Wake up!

696
01:11:30,064 --> 01:11:31,607
¡Desátame!

697
01:11:31,608 --> 01:11:33,329
Are you awake?

698
01:11:33,354 --> 01:11:36,806
I'm going to make your heart melt in front of those fucking Chinese.

699
01:11:49,463 --> 01:11:51,966
I will bring Seol-ran back.

700
01:12:19,534 --> 01:12:20,933
They have Seol-ran.

701
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:24,506
He is in Silrak Mountain, I have also found his sister.

702
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:25,841
Besides,

703
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:28,144
the old owner of the pension and her son,

704
01:12:28,808 --> 01:12:30,183
They work for Jung.

705
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,324
They are involved in garlic.

706
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,117
My money! My money!

707
01:12:45,142 --> 01:12:46,187
My money!

708
01:12:49,997 --> 01:12:52,879
Only the blood of Jesus can take away with it all my sins!

709
01:12:52,989 --> 01:12:56,130
Only the blood of Jesus can take away with it all my sins!

710
01:12:56,255 --> 01:12:57,881
Only the blood of Jesus!

711
01:13:22,663 --> 01:13:23,914
Begin.

712
01:13:25,166 --> 01:13:29,045
Don't you think she's going to get a real high?

713
01:13:55,246 --> 01:13:57,372
Boss, I left the sample there!

714
01:13:57,572 --> 01:13:58,572
Go find her.

715
01:14:03,631 --> 01:14:05,507
You look for Seol-ran.

716
01:14:14,443 --> 01:14:15,620
Who is it?

717
01:14:15,837 --> 01:14:17,837
The important thing is not who he is,

718
01:14:17,862 --> 01:14:19,618
is that he should be dead.

719
01:14:30,089 --> 01:14:31,698
Take care of him.

720
01:15:08,236 --> 01:15:09,244
Shit...

721
01:15:29,322 --> 01:15:32,255
She's just a girl, how could you do that to her?!

722
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:35,491
You have a very strange accent, where are you from?

723
01:15:35,536 --> 01:15:38,266
Douchebag! I'm fed up!

724
01:15:38,291 --> 01:15:40,475
What the hell does the fucking accent matter?!

725
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:42,412
I'm from Yanbian, asshole!

726
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:44,131
fuck you

727
01:15:49,889 --> 01:15:51,390
I'll kill you...

728
01:16:00,712 --> 01:16:02,251
When I catch you, I'll kill you!

729
01:16:02,276 --> 01:16:03,805
What's next.

730
01:16:10,189 --> 01:16:11,884
Fucking knot, untie!

731
01:17:14,078 --> 01:17:15,119
Hey!

732
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:16,627
¡Seol-ran! ¡Seol-ran!

733
01:17:16,652 --> 01:17:19,196
Wake up! Wake up at once!

734
01:17:22,289 --> 01:17:24,248
fucking disaster...

735
01:18:02,471 --> 01:18:04,105
I'm sick of all this.

736
01:19:39,259 --> 01:19:40,351
Dime.

737
01:19:40,453 --> 01:19:42,351
Did you know detective Yoon,

738
01:19:42,836 --> 01:19:44,688
the agent you murdered?

739
01:19:45,101 --> 01:19:46,257
Suck my dick.

740
01:19:46,516 --> 01:19:47,555
Speaks!

741
01:19:48,211 --> 01:19:49,258
Now you know,

742
01:19:49,438 --> 01:19:51,594
I didn't know him at all...

743
01:19:54,194 --> 01:19:57,656
Who's the confidante you've been paying off?

744
01:19:57,876 --> 01:19:59,204
you are a bastard

745
01:19:59,689 --> 01:20:01,057
Fuck you!

746
01:20:01,330 --> 01:20:04,017
You know perfectly well it was Park!

747
01:21:10,373 --> 01:21:11,623
bastard...

748
01:21:11,624 --> 01:21:15,754
Motherfucker...

749
01:21:16,005 --> 01:21:18,090
Shit...

750
01:21:54,386 --> 01:21:56,513
¡Seol-ran, Seol-ran!

751
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:00,685
Wake up!

752
01:22:01,061 --> 01:22:03,188
Wake up! Seol-ran!

753
01:22:05,150 --> 01:22:06,651
Song-hwa...

754
01:22:08,654 --> 01:22:10,697
Where is my sister?

755
01:22:18,208 --> 01:22:22,879
Come with me if you want to see her, I have provided her with a good hiding place.

756
01:23:42,271 --> 01:23:44,731
¡Song-hwa!

757
01:23:58,667 --> 01:24:00,668
¡Song-hwa!

758
01:24:25,367 --> 01:24:27,910
Don't you want to go back to Seoul?

759
01:24:28,078 --> 01:24:30,706
I still don't want to go.

760
01:24:42,230 --> 01:24:43,972
¡Gook-hyun!

761
01:24:53,235 --> 01:24:55,987
Thank you.

762
01:25:33,076 --> 01:25:39,291
For the late detective Kang, Heuksan was an island of hope.

763
01:25:46,051 --> 01:25:48,222
Where were you?

764
01:25:48,744 --> 01:25:49,801
Eun-jae,

765
01:25:49,856 --> 01:25:51,246
what is this?

766
01:25:59,443 --> 01:26:01,361
Who has given it to you?

767
01:26:07,161 --> 01:26:08,828
I am Ki-man Kang.

768
01:26:09,622 --> 01:26:11,719
Detective Jae-ho Yoon was indicted...

769
01:26:11,813 --> 01:26:13,899
...and killed because of me.

770
01:26:14,753 --> 01:26:16,409
He was a brave policeman

771
01:26:16,644 --> 01:26:18,784
one who gave everything for others,

772
01:26:19,269 --> 01:26:21,081
and died trying to save his companion.

773
01:26:22,513 --> 01:26:26,559
I'm glad I was able to launder his image and reputation.

774
01:26:26,894 --> 01:26:33,693
With all my heart, I would like to beg your and Eun-jae's forgiveness.

775
01:26:44,374 --> 01:26:46,756
Baby, who gave it to you?

776
01:26:46,781 --> 01:26:48,584
How was it? Where has she gone?

777
01:27:01,687 --> 01:27:03,522
¡Eh, Nam!

778
01:27:03,523 --> 01:27:07,443
They told me you're not airing the Heuksan cop story.

779
01:27:07,861 --> 01:27:11,824
Think about it, it would be a great success.
