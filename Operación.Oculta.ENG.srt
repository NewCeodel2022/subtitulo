1
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:08,861
This film was inspired by true events

2
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:19,664
Tokyo Harbor

3
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:26,294
A powerful hurricane has emerged
off the Philippine coast,

4
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:28,214
and is projected to move north.

5
00:01:28,715 --> 00:01:29,841
Its name is Jane.

6
00:01:30,425 --> 00:01:31,509
Jane...

7
00:01:32,844 --> 00:01:34,679
That's a lovely name.

8
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:37,181
Sir, we are ready to begin
the Diversion Operation.

9
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:39,517
Planning to launch
in Yeongdeok, Jangsadong,

10
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:43,229
Gunsan and Samcheok
on September 12th and 14th.

11
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:50,778
Sir, if I may...

12
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:54,281
Yes?

13
00:01:55,575 --> 00:01:58,953
This operation could entail
many casualties.

14
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:01,664
Should we proceed?

15
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:12,048
June 25, 1950

16
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:19,724
June 25, 1950 With the Soviet Union's
support, North Korea invades the South

17
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:25,729
June 27, 1950 USA President
Truman deploys the U.S. Army

18
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:31,234
June 27, 1950 and assigns General Douglas MacArthur
as the Commander-in-chief of the UN Command

19
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:33,279
However,

20
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:41,620
the rest of South Korea, north of
the Nakdong River, falls in a month

21
00:02:41,621 --> 00:02:45,916
In order to turn the tide of war,

22
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:48,920
Gen. MacArthur orders
a covert operation involving 8 men

23
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:08,648
One week ago

24
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:43,474
Comrade, got a light?

25
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,451
"They Fought For Their Country."

26
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:05,037
THEY FOUGHT FOR THEIR COUNTRY

27
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:09,221
If you read those books too much,
you will lose touch with reality.

28
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:18,593
But our ideas of the world
all came from books.

29
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:25,558
At the end, the protagonist gets shot,

30
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,693
and while dying,
he looks up at the blue sky.

31
00:04:28,603 --> 00:04:29,603
But...

32
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:35,609
Sholokhov describes the blue sky
with a beautiful metaphor,

33
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,445
and I'm saying that is a lie.

34
00:04:38,863 --> 00:04:40,865
Cut the chitchat
and get to your point.

35
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:42,741
What I mean is...

36
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:45,702
when a man is dying in pain,

37
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:48,164
would he admire the beautiful sky?

38
00:04:49,457 --> 00:04:50,791
Am I wrong?

39
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:53,878
Comrade Park Nam-Cheol.

40
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,101
We'll go to Incheon for you.

41
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,249
Head of Incheon Defense Zone Ops,
Lieutenant Ryu Jang-Choon, Sir.

42
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,460
I'm Park Nam-Cheol.

43
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,420
Defense Commander is expecting you.

44
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,381
Our convoy is standing by.

45
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:45,553
PROTECT OUR LAND WITH OUR BLOOD <i>Incheon has been
liberated by Democratic People's Republic of Korea!</i>

46
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:48,234
<i>Incheon has been liberated
by Democratic People's Republic of Korea!</i>

47
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:50,768
<i>Hooray for the liberation of Incheon!</i>

48
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,312
<i>Citizens of Incheon!</i>

49
00:05:53,813 --> 00:05:56,524
<i>Your land has been liberated!</i>

50
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:02,947
<i>Let us march forward together
toward the liberation of the country!</i>

51
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:06,075
<i>Your time of peace has started!</i>

52
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:10,704
Unacceptable, intolerable, insulting!

53
00:06:10,705 --> 00:06:11,622
War Room, UN Command HQ, Tokyo
Get back to work!

54
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:12,373
War Room, UN Command HQ, Tokyo

55
00:06:12,374 --> 00:06:13,915
War Room, UN Command HQ, Tokyo
Tell the French to send more troops!

56
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:14,250
War Room, UN Command HQ, Tokyo

57
00:06:14,251 --> 00:06:15,750
War Room, UN Command HQ, Tokyo
Pester them until they do!

58
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:19,462
If they refuse, I will call
President Auriol myself.

59
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:20,673
And what of the Australians?

60
00:06:20,965 --> 00:06:23,551
Are they sending their
aircraft carriers or are they not?

61
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:27,262
Find out at once.
And I won't accept anything but "yes."

62
00:06:27,263 --> 00:06:28,389
Yes, Sir!

63
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:34,478
Sir, we've just received intel on their
fortification efforts on Wolmido Island.

64
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,439
The commander in charge
is named Lim Gye-Jin.

65
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,234
And the construction is under his control,
not Pyeongyang's.

66
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:54,915
Park Nam-Cheol reporting.

67
00:06:58,294 --> 00:06:59,628
I'm Lim Gye-Jin.

68
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:03,132
How's the Nakdong River front?

69
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:04,424
It's a bloodbath.

70
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:06,218
Of course.

71
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,599
Here is the report
of our troop placement.

72
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:14,769
226th Infantry Regiment is in Incheon.

73
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:19,148
918th Artillery Regiment,
second battalion is stationed there.

74
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:25,029
2,048 infantry, 231 in Artillery Regiment
and 487 in 42nd Armored Vehicle Regiment.

75
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:32,244
Considering Incheon's geography,
the enemy can only access land routes

76
00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:35,081
from Gimpo, Siheung and Hwaseong.

77
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:38,793
Aviation units and artillery units
are stationed at each location.

78
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:42,254
Incheon's harbor is fortified
by six meter-high seawalls,

79
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,280
making it impossible to climb over.

80
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:48,677
What is the best defense
if the American bastards attack by sea?

81
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:54,308
There is only one narrow channel
into the bay they could access.

82
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:58,729
One disabled landing boat
could completely block the entrance.

83
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:03,651
Once it's blocked off, we'll use a 76 mm
artillery gun barrage to wipe them out.

84
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:05,485
That is all.

85
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:08,447
Comrade Lieutenant...

86
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,450
76 mm artillery guns would be useless.

87
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:14,703
If the landing boats get to shore,
it's all over.

88
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,580
They must be stopped at sea.

89
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:20,167
Also...

90
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,922
why no mention of naval mines?

91
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,594
Are they not set?

92
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:34,681
We...

93
00:08:36,142 --> 00:08:38,644
lined the waterway with them.

94
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:46,610
You marked them clearly on a map then?

95
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:50,614
Bring it to me.

96
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:52,532
I...

97
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:57,913
will be personally reporting that

98
00:08:58,873 --> 00:09:00,833
to the Supreme Commander himself.

99
00:09:06,881 --> 00:09:09,008
When will you begin
the on-site inspections?

100
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,343
Tomorrow at 0700 hours sharp.

101
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:15,555
Comrade Park...

102
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,184
don't be so hasty.

103
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,369
Good work, men. Rest easy.

104
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:42,791
Just pass out on the bed.

105
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:57,348
Incheon became like this
in just two months.

106
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:03,646
Young Master,

107
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,188
allow me to do that for you.

108
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:06,357
I've got hands, too.

109
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:09,860
And I told you not to call me that.

110
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:15,157
The dog days have passed.

111
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,327
I had so many chickens back home.

112
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,498
Confirm their transmission

113
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:24,708
and send this, too.

114
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,793
Yes, Captain.

115
00:10:25,794 --> 00:10:32,090
<i>Report 1, enemy regiment
locations in Incheon.</i>

116
00:10:32,091 --> 00:10:35,219
<i>Report 2, defensive positions
on the coast.</i>

117
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:45,229
KLO Incheon (Korea Liaison Office)
Covert Intelligence Unit

118
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:52,695
This is SEO Jin-Chul from KLO Incheon.

119
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:55,029
Sir, we've made contact with the KLO.

120
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,699
Tell them to locate the mines.

121
00:10:57,032 --> 00:11:00,119
Finding the exact location
is top priority.

122
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:01,869
Do whatever it takes.

123
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,870
Yes, Sir!

124
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,791
This is a direct order
from General MacArthur.

125
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:09,878
Is that Palmido Lighthouse?

126
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:11,379
That is correct.

127
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:27,229
VICTORY CELEBRATION TOAST

128
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:37,031
This is Inspector Park Nam-Cheol
from the headquarters.

129
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:38,991
They're Incheon Hospital staff.

130
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:45,247
Be careful of him.

131
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:48,125
This gentleman is here to monitor us.

132
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:50,084
Isn't that right?

133
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:54,381
Comrade Park...

134
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,925
When I studied
at the Communist University of Moscow,

135
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:01,138
Professor Malchikov was my idol.

136
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:03,891
Mine, as well.

137
00:12:06,352 --> 00:12:08,270
When he...

138
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:12,149
shot his beautiful sister Sonja
and executed her with his pistol,

139
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:16,278
all of the Korean students cheered.

140
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:19,323
Do you know this story?

141
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:24,620
Sonja believed in Christianity...

142
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,791
so she got three bullets to the head.

143
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,878
Comrade Han, what do you think?

144
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:36,799
If your uncle believed in Christianity,

145
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:39,218
what would you do?

146
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:41,553
Dissuade him.

147
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:50,229
And if it's impossible
to dissuade him, then what?

148
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:55,525
But still, he's my uncle...

149
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:58,821
She means, he raised her
since she was a baby.

150
00:12:59,071 --> 00:13:00,364
Just say you can kill him.

151
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:06,452
But how can a religious man
follow our party's ideology?

152
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,539
Religion has to be rooted out
just like with opium.

153
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:14,420
What would you do, Comrade Park?

154
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,718
It's up to the individual.

155
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:30,310
Comrade Park...

156
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:37,275
Do you believe in God?

157
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,487
Do you see God?

158
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,074
Where is He?

159
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:51,039
The party has already said
there is no God.

160
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,544
Isn't that right?

161
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:04,845
What is your unit password?

162
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,684
I could be shot
for being reckless with it.

163
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:24,948
Comrade Lim...

164
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,248
<i>Crimson Dostoevsky</i>

165
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,091
Crimson Dostoevsky.

166
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:53,851
This is Jung Sun-Sil.

167
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:54,936
Head Secretary's Office
DPRK HQ, Pyeongyang

168
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:57,271
Head Secretary's Office DPRK HQ, Pyeongyang
It has been a while, Defense Commander.

169
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:57,856
Head Secretary's Office
DPRK HQ, Pyeongyang

170
00:14:57,857 --> 00:14:59,106
Head Secretary's Office DPRK HQ,
Pyeongyang How may I help you?

171
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:03,278
Do you know Park Nam-Cheol
from the Supreme Headquarters?

172
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:05,822
Yes, of course.

173
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:08,200
Do you know him well?

174
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:14,748
Comrade Park has a knife scar
on the left side of his neck.

175
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:40,524
All done.

176
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:43,819
You don't need a trim today.

177
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:45,194
Very good.

178
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:47,281
As you say.

179
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:58,500
Take it, it's a gift.

180
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:02,254
But Sir, why me?

181
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:04,380
I don't deserve this.

182
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:06,341
Please give it to Comrade Han.

183
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:14,099
I'm kidding! Put it on!

184
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:15,433
Of course!

185
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:24,568
Supreme Commander
Kim Il-Sung! Hooray!

186
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:29,239
We're at wits' end.

187
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,743
They won't cough it up,
and we don't know where it is.

188
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:35,870
Can't they use a minesweeper
at the start of the invasion?

189
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:37,289
That's nonsense!

190
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:40,208
The coverage area is too wide
for something like that.

191
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:52,012
Emergency inspection!

192
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:53,804
Everyone freeze!

193
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,382
Yankee Nemesis MacArthur

194
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:31,760
Puppet Syngman Rhee

195
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:40,477
Defense Commander...

196
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:42,604
This document was submitted to me.

197
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,648
The number of naval mines
doesn't match up.

198
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,151
I need to inspect them personally.

199
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:49,528
Give me the chart.

200
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:56,952
Comrade Park...

201
00:17:57,411 --> 00:17:59,037
you're awfully interested
in those mines.

202
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,960
What's with the fixation?

203
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:10,048
My objective here is to make sure
everything is in order, is it not?

204
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,717
I told you before...

205
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:17,723
I'm reporting that
directly to Pyeongyang.

206
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:19,683
Do you still want to see it?

207
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:22,853
Defense Commander...

208
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,647
have you made a mistake?

209
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:28,733
Why can't I ever get
a clear answer on naval mines?

210
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:55,677
My apologies.

211
00:18:56,928 --> 00:19:04,561
Spies are littered everywhere.

212
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:13,361
Begin sending out false intel
regarding landing operations in...

213
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:17,199
Wonsan, Jumunjin,

214
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:18,574
and Gunsan.

215
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:22,787
Make sure the transmissions
are wiretapped.

216
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:24,371
Send out massive amounts!

217
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:25,372
Yes, Sir.

218
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,250
Yes?

219
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,921
Efforts to gather intel
on the mines were unsuccessful.

220
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:32,798
They need more time.

221
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,050
Without detecting the mines,

222
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:38,261
our fleet cannot navigate through
the narrow waterways at Incheon.

223
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:39,638
Orders, Sir?

224
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:40,931
Orders?

225
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:42,808
Get God on the phone.

226
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:45,894
Tell Him it's me.
Tell Him we need more time.

227

6, the UN forces are assembling in Kobe port.

Central Relay Center DPRK HQ, Pyeongyang They're calling
for all-out attack at the Nakdong River frontline.

235
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:20,693
They're calling for all-out attack
at the Nakdong River frontline.

236
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,320
Where are they targeting?

237
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,867

We're to recruit Lim.

241

LONG LIVE THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA

242
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:13,023
Where do you think MacArthur will attack?

243
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,278
I'm certain it's Incheon.

244
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:26,661
I have to convince
the idiots in Pyeongyang...

245
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:29,748
but the proof isn't there.

246
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:40,508
I know you worked
at the National Intelligence Bureau.

247
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:44,262
You didn't hear anything?

248
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,308
Any words you heard
from the Soviets or China?

249
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:53,188
Headquarters believes
that it won't be Incheon.

250
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,984
I believe MacArthur will...

251
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:01,821
come to Incheon.

252
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:09,120
Do you know what those Americans
estimate as their chances at Incheon?

253
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,623
Five thousand to one.

254
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,417
It's virtually impossible.

255
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:20,382
So why should he come
to Incheon with those chances?

256
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,639
To be remembered as a hero?

257
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:35,480
That old decrepit wants Incheon
to be his Normandy?

258
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:46,408
UN Command HQ, Tokyo
August 23, 1950, final strategy meeting

259
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:50,828
Well, well, well...

260
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:54,832
The Pentagon must be on milk break,
dispensing The Three Stooges

261
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:56,333
to silence the old mad dog.

262
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:57,252
The Three Stooges, huh?
To silence the old mad dog.

263
00:22:57,252 --> 00:22:58,252
The Three Stooges, huh?

264
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:00,004
Who's Moe?

265
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:01,005
Well, I'm Larry.

266
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:02,423
Well, I'm sure as hell
not gonna be Curly.

267
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:04,008
- C'mon gentlemen!
- Then, I'm Moe!

268
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:05,051
Big smile!

269
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:11,890
DPRK HQ, Pyeongyang
Where do you think the UN will attack?

270
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:15,894
Wonsan, Jumunjin, Gunsan
and Incheon are all smoke screens.

271
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:18,648
I believe it's very likely
that they will invade Gimpo

272
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,066
with paratroopers
from hundreds of planes!

273
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:23,319
They could defy convention

274
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,071
and attack Pyeongyang directly.

275
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:28,115
Supreme Commander
Kim Il-Sung

276
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:28,783
Supreme Commander Kim Il-Sung Why
is no one talking about Incheon?

277
00:23:28,784 --> 00:23:30,827
Why is no one talking about Incheon?

278
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:33,788
Incheon tides
are the worst in the world!

279
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,749
They rise and fall at an average
rate of 29 feet each day.

280
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,209
Sometimes as high as 36!

281
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,588
Our ships will be stranded
within ten minutes of entry!

282
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,880
And the harbor?

283
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:45,008
Harbor's too narrow
to be able to turn around.

284
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,969
That is why we developed
three separate routes.

285
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:50,847
Red, green and blue!

286
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:52,390
Even if we get through,

287
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:55,226
there's only one landing zone
in Incheon.

288
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:55,894
Incheon Harbor

289
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:56,770
There!
Incheon Harbor

290
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:57,145
Landing is not the only problem.
Incheon Harbor

291
00:23:57,146 --> 00:23:58,426
Landing is not the only problem.

292
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:00,314
The mudflats will swallow our tanks.

293
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:03,568
How do you expect our marines
to climb treacherous cliffs that high

294
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,528
with waves that harsh?

295
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,530
There is a simple solution.

296
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:08,948
We use ladders.

297
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:12,242
Ladders...

298
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:13,620
More importantly,

299
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:17,874
how do you expect to move
75,000 troops at dusk

300
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,668
with only one hour
of daylight remaining?

301
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:24,047
There is a lighthouse
on the Palmido shore.

302
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:27,467
We will seize it, and there will be light.

303
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:31,136
Well, I don't know
about you, gentlemen,

304
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:32,680
but this gives me great confidence.

305
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:35,517
I'm gonna go back to Washington
and break the good news.

306
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:37,477
"President Truman,

307
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:40,939
General MacArthur says
we've got nothing to worry about.

308
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:44,901
Because we have ladders
and a lighthouse.

309
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:46,653
We're not going to Busan.

310
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:51,282
Instead, we're gonna send
75,000 troops to Incheon.

311
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:53,326
Why?

312
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,038
Because we have ladders
and a lighthouse."

313
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,124
I think I'm gonna drink to that.

314
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:01,208
To a successful campaign!

315
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:03,085
Vandenberg,
do you want to win this war?

316
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:05,462
I think I should be asking
the same question of you, General.

317
00:25:05,463 --> 00:25:06,297
What do you think?

318
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:10,342
There are men dying in Busan,
and you're proposing a suicide mission!

319
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:12,427
Fortifying Busan is suicide!

320
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:15,598
Don't hit them where they are strong,
hit them where they are not!

321
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:19,602
Cut off their supply line!
Force 'em to starve!

322
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:21,354
Is MacArthur stupid?

323
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:25,316
All of our forces
are at the Nakdong frontlines.

324
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:27,694
Why'd he try to fight us there?

325
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:30,029
Are they all morons?

326
00:25:30,488 --> 00:25:32,322
Out of the frying pan and into the fire?

327
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:34,033
Hey, hey, hey!

328
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:36,451
Even the U.S. Secretary
of Defense has said

329
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:40,747
the odds of a successful invasion
of Incheon are five thousand to one.

330
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:41,958
Five thousand to one.

331
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,918
Five thousand to one!
That's the odds that you get on this one!

332
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:48,298
This is the riskiest military operation
that I've ever encountered!

333
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,048
But that's it!

334
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,551
Know your enemy and yourself,
you can win all wars!

335
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:53,678
Supreme Commander...

336
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:58,098
do you know what MacArthur wants?

337
00:25:58,099 --> 00:25:59,559
I fight wars to win!

338
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:02,729
Operation Chromite
is the only way to victory!

339
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:05,023
Operation Chromite?

340
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:06,481
It's a cute name.

341
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:10,028
You intentionally delay reporting to us...

342
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:11,362
your plans.

343
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:14,490
You wait until we get here
all the way from Washington,

344
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:17,160
and then you not only insult us...

345
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:19,621
but the President of the United States.

346
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:20,954
And then,

347
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:23,749
you have one plan with no recourse!

348
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,168
One plan!

349
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,460
Why?

350
00:26:26,544 --> 00:26:28,713
Why the fixation on Incheon?

351
00:26:29,005 --> 00:26:30,798
What MacArthur wants...

352
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:33,676
is to be the president.

353
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:38,347
That's why he needs a miracle
of five thousand to one.

354
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:42,519
This is exactly why he'll invade Incheon!

355
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,187
What are you after?

356
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:46,940
What do you want out of this?

357
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:52,236
Two days after the war
broke out in Korea,

358
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:55,197
I made a secret trip there
from Tokyo to assess the damage.

359
00:26:55,198 --> 00:26:56,490
I made a secret trip there from Tokyo to assess the
damage. South Korean Defense Frontline June 28, 1950

360
00:26:56,491 --> 00:26:56,866
South Korean Defense Frontline
June 28, 1950

361
00:26:56,867 --> 00:27:00,327
I came across a young Korean boy alone in the trench.
South Korean Defense Frontline June 28, 1950

362
00:27:00,328 --> 00:27:00,745
South Korean Defense Frontline
June 28, 1950

363
00:27:00,745 --> 00:27:01,204
No older than sixteen South Korean
Defense Frontline June 28, 1950

364
00:27:01,205 --> 00:27:03,081
No older than sixteen.

365
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,708
He had no gun, no shirt.

366
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:08,211
All others had retreated.

367
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,546
I was perplexed.

368
00:27:10,922 --> 00:27:13,049
"Why are you here?" I asked him.

369
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:14,758
He replied,
"No one ordered me to leave."

370
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:17,479
<i>No one ordered me to leave.</i> He
replied, "No one ordered me to leave."

371
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:21,307
I was moved by his courage.

372
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:26,187
I said, "I will give you
anything you want."

373
00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:30,233
He looked at me
with fire in his eyes and said,

374
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:33,443
<i>Give me a gun and give me bullets.</i>

375
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:37,031
"Give me a gun and give me bullets."

376
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:39,284
That boy and I shared something.

377
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:41,077
We were soldiers.

378
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:43,745
Two soldiers with the same goal...

379
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:44,746
victory!

380
00:27:46,249 --> 00:27:49,711
I knew then I had to save
this boy's country.

381
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,227
We've got until September 10,
2100 hours to secure the chart.

382
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:15,653
It's not in the armory nor the archives,
not even the naval war room.

383
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:18,823
Their offices are the only places
left to check.

384
00:28:23,411 --> 00:28:25,413
FOR THE VICTORY OF THE PEOPLE

385
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:39,177
Welcome.

386
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:44,849
When does the boat depart
from Songhaksa?

387
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,147
Have you brought an umbrella?

388
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:55,568
Sir...

389
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,660
Navy Intelligence Bureau
Captain Jang Hak-Soo.

390
00:28:58,029 --> 00:29:00,198
KLO Incheon, Choi Suk-Joong.

391
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:02,950
Come sit down.

392
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:12,502
How can I help you?

393
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:16,547
We'll bring the naval mine chart.

394
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:18,841
Arrange a carrier for us.

395
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:22,094
When will it arrive?

396
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:23,388
Midnight tomorrow.

397
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,808
Understood.

398
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:31,020
After you hand over the chart, muster at
the abandoned school on Youngheung Island.

399
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:34,481
A unit led by Captain SEO Jin-Chul
will be waiting there.

400
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:37,652
Be careful.
Lim Gye-Jin is relentless.

401
00:29:56,754 --> 00:29:57,754
Come in.

402
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,140
Not asleep yet?

403
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:09,099
May I...

404
00:30:10,143 --> 00:30:12,478
go visit my children for a moment?

405
00:30:13,354 --> 00:30:16,190
My wife sells vegetables
at a morning market nearby.

406
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:23,239
Once this mission is over,
the war will end.

407
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:26,659
Please hold on a little longer.

408
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:29,369
Of course.

409
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:31,289
Have a good night.

410
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,008
MARCH FORWARD TO ULTIMATE VICTORY
IN THE WAR OF UNIFICATION

411
00:30:53,603 --> 00:30:55,438
We must infiltrate during the day.

412
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:57,439
Kang Bong-Po...

413
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:01,068
track guards during all shifts,
and their relief time.

414
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:05,323
Nam, distract the guards.

415
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:10,411
And Cho will sneak into Lim's office
through the window.

416
00:31:13,998 --> 00:31:16,667
Song and Yang, get us more weapons.

417
00:31:17,585 --> 00:31:20,797
Oh and CHUN,
secure the vehicles and exfil route.

418
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:25,301
I'll keep Lim and Ryu occupied
in the meantime.

419
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,100
Let's synchronize.

420
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:38,356
It's currently 1638 hours.

421
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,489
Upon securing the chart,

422
00:31:47,073 --> 00:31:50,117
get out swiftly and safely.

423
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,540
Do it again.

424
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:58,417
Is this a joke?

425
00:31:59,043 --> 00:32:00,670
Your salute is all wrong!

426
00:32:00,962 --> 00:32:02,254
Get your eyeline right!

427
00:32:02,255 --> 00:32:04,298
Where are you going?

428
00:32:04,882 --> 00:32:06,926
Stand together. Salute again.

429
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:09,886
You clap and salute, clap and salute!

430
00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:12,264
Stay focused! Clap and salute!

431
00:32:12,265 --> 00:32:15,141
Again! Salute! Clap! Salute and clap!

432
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:16,268
Don't salute, clap!

433
00:32:27,238 --> 00:32:31,783
Turn left when I say "Comrade,"
and your training is complete,

434
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:34,620
but if you turn right, you're a traitor.

435
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:36,080
Okay, Comrade.

436
00:32:37,081 --> 00:32:38,791
Snap out of it! Do it right!

437
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:40,083
Again, Comrade.

438
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:42,378
We're leftists. Once more.

439
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:43,921
Comrade!

440
00:32:43,922 --> 00:32:46,507
Snap out of it! You stupid shit!

441
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:51,469
Here.

442
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:01,522
I have many things to report,
so I'll head back, Sir.

443
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:03,898
Okay.

444
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,280
Comrade Ryu...

445
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:13,868
It's a good day,

446
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,828
why not stay a little longer?

447
00:33:27,715 --> 00:33:28,883
Have a great time.

448
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:20,518
Do it right!

449
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:26,023
Comrade Ryu...
What brings you here?

450
00:34:29,402 --> 00:34:30,402
Get back.

451
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:32,029
Back to your position!

452
00:34:32,363 --> 00:34:33,363
Yes, Sir!

453
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:39,203
I managed to secure myself
a bottle of vodka.

454
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:40,870
Comrade Ryu...

455
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,290
Don't you hear me?

456
00:34:48,379 --> 00:34:50,339
How about 50% alcohol vodka?

457
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,050
Your tongue will go insane.

458
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:54,677
That vodka...

459
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:58,556
looks like this.

460
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:20,453
Open it!

461
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:47,021
Incheon Sea Naval Mine Placement

462
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:55,070
Guards! Guards!

463
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,740
Two Southern spies!

464
00:35:58,949 --> 00:35:59,950
Capture them!

465
00:36:00,451 --> 00:36:01,494
Bastards!

466
00:36:10,878 --> 00:36:11,878
Lift the sofa!

467
00:36:17,802 --> 00:36:18,802
Get the chart!

468
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:23,348
Go!

469
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,900
In-Gook!

470
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:48,790
Get them! Go capture them!

471
00:36:48,791 --> 00:36:49,791
In-Gook!

472
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:56,047
Go!

473
00:36:58,342 --> 00:37:01,971
When we achieve unification,
you should come to Incheon.

474
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,600
Okay.

475
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:18,320
What is it?

476
00:37:24,368 --> 00:37:25,828
<i>You must get out of there!</i>

477
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:29,039
They're all imposters!
South Korean spies!

478
00:38:00,321 --> 00:38:01,321
Park Nam-Cheol...

479
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:04,158
I've got a question for you.

480
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:07,841
You're part of the Soviet faction, right?

481
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:12,708
There's a famous story
that Soviet faction members know.

482
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:15,127
A guy was ordered

483
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:21,508
to shoot his bourgeois father,
but he couldn't.

484
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,096
So his friend fired the gun instead,

485
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:30,643
and he went nuts
and shot his comrades,

486
00:38:31,018 --> 00:38:32,937
then defected to the South.

487
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:40,778
I know the faces
of all Soviet faction members,

488
00:38:41,779 --> 00:38:43,989
but I don't know his face.

489
00:38:51,413 --> 00:38:53,582
What was that crazy bastard's name?

490
00:39:04,718 --> 00:39:06,135
Jang Hak-Soo.

491
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:07,888
Right, Jang Hak-Soo!

492
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,016
Jang Hak-Soo.

493
00:39:20,484 --> 00:39:21,777
So, Jang Hak-Soo...

494
00:39:22,444 --> 00:39:23,988
why are you here?

495
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:30,324
LONG LIVE THE SOVIET UNION

496
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:35,331
Answer me...

497
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:37,418
Jang Hak-Soo.

498
00:39:38,085 --> 00:39:39,128
Young Master...

499
00:39:40,671 --> 00:39:41,880
Hold.

500
00:40:04,862 --> 00:40:06,572
Get out! Get outta here!

501
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:12,661
Out! Go!

502
00:40:27,593 --> 00:40:29,261
Pan-Dong! Yang Pan-Dong!

503
00:40:31,013 --> 00:40:32,097
Die!

504
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:48,906
The traitors are inside!

505
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:50,114
Get inside!

506
00:40:50,324 --> 00:40:51,825
Hurry! Get inside!

507
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:54,870
The commander is in danger!
Go save him!

508
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:09,050
Captain!

509
00:41:09,343 --> 00:41:10,343
Captain!

510
00:41:11,345 --> 00:41:12,387
Hop in! Go on!

511
00:41:17,851 --> 00:41:19,186
Captain!

512
00:41:32,533 --> 00:41:33,992
Protect the commander!

513
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:50,341
Hurry up!

514
00:41:57,891 --> 00:41:59,476
Sang-Deuk!

515
00:42:00,978 --> 00:42:01,979
Captain!

516
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:06,607
Go!

517
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:07,650
Just go!

518
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:17,286
Sang-Deuk!

519
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:20,037
No!

520
00:42:41,435 --> 00:42:43,187
You sons of bitches!

521
00:42:44,813 --> 00:42:47,065
They walked in and robbed you blind!

522
00:42:48,025 --> 00:42:49,400
Who was on guard?

523
00:42:49,401 --> 00:42:50,611
I-I was, Sir!

524
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:55,991
Who else is a spy?

525
00:42:58,202 --> 00:42:59,453
Did you help them infiltrate?

526
00:43:02,581 --> 00:43:03,582
Commander!

527
00:43:05,209 --> 00:43:08,629
These brothers had Yankee weapons!

528
00:43:09,963 --> 00:43:11,003
Are you the older brother?

529
00:43:13,842 --> 00:43:15,510
Brother! Brother!

530
00:43:16,011 --> 00:43:17,179
Don't kill me!

531
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:18,889
I'll talk!

532
00:43:26,939 --> 00:43:28,148
Look at him shake!

533
00:43:30,692 --> 00:43:32,027
Untie him!

534
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:38,532
What's your name?

535
00:43:39,618 --> 00:43:42,119
Lee Young-Cheol, Sir.

536
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:45,499
Tell me who handed you...

537
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:47,708
the guns.

538
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:52,256
Go on, tell me.

539
00:43:52,631 --> 00:43:56,093
A man, he had big eyes...

540
00:43:56,593 --> 00:43:58,470
and was wearing a watch.

541
00:44:07,229 --> 00:44:08,522
A Kim Il-Sung watch!

542
00:44:08,897 --> 00:44:09,897
I swear!

543
00:44:14,528 --> 00:44:17,447
Isn't school the rendezvous point?

544
00:44:20,409 --> 00:44:21,618
The mission went south.

545
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:23,787
Perhaps it was too much.

546
00:44:30,794 --> 00:44:32,629
Why are you all so weak?

547
00:44:32,921 --> 00:44:34,089
Skipped dinner?

548
00:44:34,923 --> 00:44:37,551
How will you even hold up
a gun like that?

549
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:41,179
Pull yourselves together.

550
00:44:43,265 --> 00:44:45,100
They're members of KLO Incheon.

551
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:49,271
They handle the DPRK food supply,
so they got unlimited access.

552
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,567
Let's go to Dongmundang first.

553
00:45:03,493 --> 00:45:05,120
Ah, General Vandenberg.

554
00:45:05,662 --> 00:45:06,872
General MacArthur.

555
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:08,582
Good to see you!

556
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:12,711
Please, sit. Tea? Coffee?

557
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:15,630
You've put us in an impossible
situation, General.

558
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:18,759
Truman is seriously
considering your plan.

559
00:45:19,468 --> 00:45:21,929
But he wants to make
one thing perfectly clear.

560
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,556
We don't want the Chinese
to join the fight.

561
00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:28,852
Once we reach this line...

562
00:45:32,439 --> 00:45:33,899
the war has to end.

563
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:40,488
This war will not end by a politician
simply drawing some line on a map.

564
00:45:40,489 --> 00:45:41,907
I won't agree to that.

565
00:45:42,074 --> 00:45:45,327
It's a direct order from your
Commander-in-chief.

566
00:45:46,703 --> 00:45:48,330
Why are you being
so stubborn, General?

567
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,082
And why is Truman so ignorant?

568
00:45:50,499 --> 00:45:53,627
He wants a limited war?
That doesn't do any good.

569
00:45:54,211 --> 00:45:57,297
Communism cannot be contained
with a limited war.

570
00:45:57,589 --> 00:46:01,635
These politicians...
They don't know what war really is.

571
00:46:02,552 --> 00:46:07,349
God, it's immoral to send our soldiers
to war unless total victory is sought!

572
00:46:09,768 --> 00:46:11,019
I'm curious, General...

573
00:46:12,187 --> 00:46:13,939
What's behind Operation Chromite?

574
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:18,068
What do you really want out of this?

575
00:46:19,403 --> 00:46:21,488
Is Incheon supposed to be
your Normandy?

576
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:23,239
Huh?

577
00:46:23,448 --> 00:46:25,325
Some grand theatrics...

578
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:28,203
before your second run
at the presidency?

579
00:46:32,874 --> 00:46:36,169
You think I want to go to Incheon
to become president?

580
00:46:37,087 --> 00:46:40,132
I have dedicated 50 years
of my life to the battlefield.

581
00:46:40,382 --> 00:46:43,093
I'm Douglas MacArthur. I win wars.

582
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:46,513
Don't try and educate me
or analyze my motives.

583
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:55,147
<i>Why did you volunteer
for this operation?</i>

584
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:58,290
<i>Why did you volunteer
for this operation?</i>

585
00:47:02,863 --> 00:47:03,989
<i>Well...</i>

586
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:06,991
<i>I wanted to protect my mother!</i>

587
00:47:06,992 --> 00:47:09,119
<i>"I wanted to protect
my mother," Sir.</i>

588
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:15,208
<i>What are your plans for after the war?</i>

589
00:47:17,043 --> 00:47:18,879
<i>I'd like to get a good night's sleep.</i>

590
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:23,216
<i>I would like that, too.</i>

591
00:47:33,643 --> 00:47:36,188
<i>I will land on Incheon no matter what.</i>

592
00:47:38,857 --> 00:47:40,525
<i>Open the way for me, Son.</i>

593
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:44,779
I'll wait for you in Incheon, Sir.

594
00:48:13,225 --> 00:48:15,018
This way. Hurry.

595
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:21,398
Uncle...

596
00:48:22,734 --> 00:48:23,776
Chae-Sun...

597
00:48:23,777 --> 00:48:24,819
What's going...

598
00:48:27,364 --> 00:48:28,782
Wait, shush!

599
00:48:29,157 --> 00:48:30,157
Uncle...

600
00:48:42,379 --> 00:48:43,755
What's all this about?

601
00:48:53,807 --> 00:48:55,017
- Uncle...
- Chae-Sun!

602
00:48:55,018 --> 00:48:57,769
Jang Hak-Soo is a spy!
He's lying to you!

603
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:59,853
Please listen to me!

604
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:01,374
- No, you listen!
- What are you doing?

605
00:49:02,649 --> 00:49:03,942
Rope! Rope!

606
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:06,110
What's going on?

607
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:07,988
What's happening?

608
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:10,864
Let go!

609
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:12,157
Uncle!

610
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:14,619
Let me go!

611
00:49:17,831 --> 00:49:20,417
Freedom fighters hid here
during the Japanese imperialism.

612
00:49:21,585 --> 00:49:23,169
Chae-Sun's parents built this place.

613
00:49:32,971 --> 00:49:33,971
This is a secret tunnel.

614
00:49:34,222 --> 00:49:36,891
It's connected
to the vacant house next door.

615
00:49:39,019 --> 00:49:40,270
Use it in case of emergency.

616
00:49:41,229 --> 00:49:42,689
Uncle, you're a traitor, too?

617
00:49:46,776 --> 00:49:48,319
You can observe outside from here.

618
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:54,326
You're a traitor? Their snitch?

619
00:49:55,869 --> 00:49:57,120
Please stay quiet

620
00:49:58,371 --> 00:49:59,581
until sunrise.

621
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:01,916
Are you mad?

622
00:50:02,167 --> 00:50:03,627
We'll all be killed!

623
00:50:22,062 --> 00:50:23,688
Stand by until sunrise.

624
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:33,156
Please get me in touch
with the captain of KLO Incheon.

625
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:34,490
Will do.

626
00:51:09,859 --> 00:51:10,859
Who's there?

627
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,280
Choi Suk-Joong.

628
00:51:26,501 --> 00:51:27,501
Are you...

629
00:51:29,504 --> 00:51:30,797
looking for this?

630
00:51:49,399 --> 00:51:50,400
I was...

631
00:51:51,568 --> 00:51:53,695
a communist once, too.

632
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:01,911
There's a phrase that I really loved.

633
00:52:03,913 --> 00:52:08,168
"If the roots are rotting,
how could they bear fruit?"

634
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,548
It's a good phrase
to get students hooked.

635
00:52:16,134 --> 00:52:17,218
But one day...

636
00:52:22,182 --> 00:52:27,395
my comrades captured a bourgeois
and handed me a gun

637
00:52:28,813 --> 00:52:30,356
and told me to shoot.

638
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,488
But it was my father.

639
00:52:51,628 --> 00:52:54,297
I hesitated, too shocked to react.

640
00:52:57,717 --> 00:53:01,471
Then my best friend shot my father.

641
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:09,187
My hesitation cost my father's life.

642
00:53:13,733 --> 00:53:17,445
My friend looked at me,
filled with conviction...

643
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,909
and said,
"Ideology is thicker than blood."

644
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:29,415
You are being lied to.

645
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:33,586
What your uncle is doing-

646
00:53:45,849 --> 00:53:46,849
Lights out!

647
00:53:57,318 --> 00:53:58,444
Search every inch.

648
00:54:29,392 --> 00:54:30,392
Let's go!

649
00:54:35,899 --> 00:54:36,941
It's empty, Sir.

650
00:54:48,161 --> 00:54:49,913
Where's Jang Hak-Soo?

651
00:54:53,291 --> 00:54:56,461
I don't know who that is.

652
00:55:08,389 --> 00:55:10,266
Fucking traitor.

653
00:55:12,143 --> 00:55:13,895
Wake the whole neighborhood!

654
00:55:17,023 --> 00:55:18,232
Walk faster!

655
00:55:18,566 --> 00:55:19,566
Tie him up!

656
00:55:43,508 --> 00:55:45,385
Please! Please help him!

657
00:55:46,761 --> 00:55:48,846
He's trying to save you!

658
00:55:52,934 --> 00:55:54,936
He's going to die!

659
00:55:56,020 --> 00:56:01,275
I AM A YANKEE PUPPET
I DESERVE FULL PUNISHMENT

660
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:05,070
Please untie me!

661
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:09,366
If I talk to him,
the commander will listen to me!

662
00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:11,619
Captain, she's gonna snitch!

663
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,454
We'll all be killed!

664
00:56:14,247 --> 00:56:16,206
I won't tell them about you.

665
00:56:16,207 --> 00:56:16,749
I'll never tell.

666
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:18,000
I'll never tell.
LONG LIVE THE INDEPENDENCE OF KOREA

667
00:56:18,001 --> 00:56:19,335
You have to believe me!

668
00:56:20,169 --> 00:56:22,630
We can't just watch him die!

669
00:56:28,469 --> 00:56:29,469
Open the tunnel!

670
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:31,680
Captain!

671
00:56:32,098 --> 00:56:33,098
Captain!

672
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:46,237
Uncle! Please!

673
00:56:48,072 --> 00:56:49,240
Lim Gye-Jin...

674
00:56:50,158 --> 00:56:54,287
do you actually believe
in your rotten ideology?

675
00:56:54,537 --> 00:56:56,998
Do you really want
everyone to be equal?

676
00:57:03,546 --> 00:57:07,258
How can you kill those
who have different ideas?

677
00:57:07,884 --> 00:57:10,178
It's your last chance.

678
00:57:12,472 --> 00:57:15,558
Where is Jang Hak-Soo?

679
00:57:17,226 --> 00:57:18,811
Go on, shoot me.

680
00:57:21,689 --> 00:57:22,690
Shoot me!

681
00:57:27,612 --> 00:57:29,072
No!

682
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:39,206
Uncle! No!

683
00:57:43,044 --> 00:57:44,044
Let go!

684
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:53,638
U-Uncle!

685
00:57:54,472 --> 00:57:56,723
Come on, bitch!

686
00:57:56,724 --> 00:57:57,724
Uncle!

687
00:58:03,689 --> 00:58:04,689
Where are they?

688
00:58:06,109 --> 00:58:07,151
Where are those rats?

689
00:58:08,486 --> 00:58:09,486
Tell me!

690
00:58:14,742 --> 00:58:15,942
- You traitor!
- That's enough.

691
00:58:17,036 --> 00:58:18,036
Enough.

692
00:59:04,542 --> 00:59:06,878
It's Kim Hwa-Gyun, the driver!

693
00:59:15,261 --> 00:59:16,345
Good, you're all safe.

694
00:59:18,723 --> 00:59:20,766
Who's Captain Jang Hak-Soo?

695
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:23,644
I am.

696
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,651
We received Choi's message
and came to help.

697
00:59:31,402 --> 00:59:33,571
I'm SEO Jin-Chul,
Captain of KLO Incheon.

698
00:59:35,281 --> 00:59:38,618
The Incheon landing op is a go.

699
00:59:39,452 --> 00:59:41,287
The op commences in three days.

700
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:43,479
Since the naval mine chart is gone,

701
00:59:43,831 --> 00:59:47,335
you'll have to find
another way to locate them.

702
00:59:47,668 --> 00:59:48,919
Easy for you to say!

703
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:52,048
Can't you see we're being slaughtered?

704
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:53,340
Stop it!

705
00:59:53,591 --> 00:59:55,301
You're not the only ones at risk!

706
00:59:55,551 --> 00:59:56,843
We're all in the same shit!

707
00:59:56,844 --> 00:59:57,929
How dare you?

708
00:59:58,262 --> 01:00:00,097
There are only five of us left!

709
01:00:01,349 --> 01:00:02,849
Stop! Stop!

710
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:03,850
Enough!

711
01:00:07,271 --> 01:00:10,274
Even the last man standing
must finish this!

712
01:00:15,363 --> 01:00:17,949
Ryu Jang-Choon is in charge of the mines,
he'll know everything.

713
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:21,202
We must kidnap Ryu.

714
01:00:25,081 --> 01:00:26,207
Do you have a plan?

715
01:00:27,208 --> 01:00:28,251
He's hospitalized here.

716
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:31,921
Once we take him,
we'll exit through the basement.

717
01:00:32,213 --> 01:00:34,507
So have a car standing by
at the backdoor.

718
01:00:34,757 --> 01:00:37,301
DPRK soldiers will be dispatched
from the front,

719
01:00:37,593 --> 01:00:39,095
so lure them from this area.

720
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:41,193
Lastly, this section must be blocked off.

721
01:00:41,931 --> 01:00:43,599
This is very crucial.

722
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:45,850
I will...

723
01:00:46,769 --> 01:00:48,020
block them off.

724
01:00:50,439 --> 01:00:51,439
Me, too.

725
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,320
All right.

726
01:00:58,322 --> 01:01:01,658
If we're not at the rendezvous
by 0850 hours,

727
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:05,288
assume that we've been exposed
and proceed without us.

728
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,208
Any questions?

729
01:01:10,793 --> 01:01:15,506
Who'll take point from his room
to the X-RAY room?

730
01:01:17,091 --> 01:01:18,801
I have someone in mind.

731
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:59,258
LET'S KICK AMERICA
OUT OF THE KOREAN BORDERS

732
01:02:11,687 --> 01:02:12,687
Stop the truck!

733
01:02:33,542 --> 01:02:34,542
Are you Mrs. Nam?

734
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:34,727
Honey...

735
01:03:49,702 --> 01:03:50,702
Give him.

736
01:03:55,166 --> 01:03:57,751
He's handsome.

737
01:04:05,509 --> 01:04:07,136
Allow me.

738
01:04:30,910 --> 01:04:31,910
Don't you worry.

739
01:04:34,288 --> 01:04:35,498
I'll come back alive.

740
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:47,800
Move out!

741
01:05:12,743 --> 01:05:14,823
LEPROSY EXAMINATION ROOM
SUSPICIOUS SKIN DISEASE UNIT

742
01:05:23,087 --> 01:05:24,755
MEDICINE ROOM

743
01:05:40,688 --> 01:05:41,897
Afternoon.

744
01:05:42,356 --> 01:05:43,774
Commander.

745
01:05:47,069 --> 01:05:47,945
What do we do?

746
01:05:47,945 --> 01:05:48,445
A PATIENT'S LIFE IS THE PEOPLE'S LIVES

747
01:05:48,446 --> 01:05:50,526
A PATIENT'S LIFE IS THE PEOPLE'S LIVES
Comrade Han...

748
01:05:52,032 --> 01:05:53,116
Your uncle...

749
01:05:55,619 --> 01:05:57,454
chose the wrong path.

750
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:03,627
Use this opportunity
to raise your profile.

751
01:06:05,713 --> 01:06:09,049
Ideology is thicker
than blood after all.

752
01:06:22,730 --> 01:06:23,981
You'll feel drowsy.

753
01:06:32,156 --> 01:06:33,157
Where are you going?

754
01:06:33,449 --> 01:06:36,285
He needs an X-ray.
Shrapnels are still inside.

755
01:06:37,828 --> 01:06:38,828
It's okay.

756
01:06:39,663 --> 01:06:40,706
I can do it myself.

757
01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:55,304
I have something to tell you.

758
01:06:56,013 --> 01:06:58,057
Could you stay here for a moment?

759
01:06:59,558 --> 01:07:00,559
Certainly.

760
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:37,220
What-

761
01:07:37,721 --> 01:07:38,721
Who are you?

762
01:07:52,861 --> 01:07:54,405
Move! Move!

763
01:08:04,123 --> 01:08:05,323
They're going to the basement!

764
01:08:05,457 --> 01:08:06,457
Go after them!

765
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:11,004
Captain!

766
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:13,006
Over here!

767
01:08:13,298 --> 01:08:14,298
Run!

768
01:08:15,008 --> 01:08:16,008
Here!

769
01:08:16,677 --> 01:08:18,178
Run! Now!

770
01:08:22,391 --> 01:08:23,391
Move!

771
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:29,480
After them!

772
01:08:39,867 --> 01:08:40,867
Step on it!

773
01:09:14,777 --> 01:09:15,777
Stay on their trail!

774
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:36,088
Grenade, grenade!

775
01:09:50,813 --> 01:09:52,648
THE PEOPLE OF INCHEON ARE FREE

776
01:10:06,537 --> 01:10:07,537
Watch out!

777
01:11:11,351 --> 01:11:12,060
No!

778
01:11:12,061 --> 01:11:13,270
Captain!

779
01:12:00,901 --> 01:12:01,901
After them!

780
01:12:14,039 --> 01:12:15,039
Move!

781
01:12:16,750 --> 01:12:18,168
Go on without me.

782
01:12:19,419 --> 01:12:20,753
You have to save yourself!

783
01:12:20,754 --> 01:12:22,255
Shut up! We're leaving together!

784
01:12:23,715 --> 01:12:24,715
You fucking rat!

785
01:12:28,512 --> 01:12:29,512
DAL-Joong!

786
01:12:55,622 --> 01:12:56,873
Captain!

787
01:13:13,682 --> 01:13:15,976
Sis! We did it!

788
01:13:22,357 --> 01:13:24,276
Sis!

789
01:13:38,290 --> 01:13:39,290
Sis!

790
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:46,048
No!

791
01:14:15,827 --> 01:14:18,038
Any reports on our men?

792
01:14:22,125 --> 01:14:26,088
This was successful in Wonsan,
but it's no guarantee.

793
01:14:26,838 --> 01:14:28,255
What do you mean?

794
01:14:28,256 --> 01:14:29,381
What are you doing?

795
01:14:29,382 --> 01:14:31,342
Your heart might explode.

796
01:14:31,343 --> 01:14:33,095
Hey! Hey!

797
01:14:33,261 --> 01:14:35,180
Why would my heart explode? Why?

798
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:37,557
Mines aren't the only thing in your way!

799
01:14:37,849 --> 01:14:39,101
Mines are nothing!

800
01:14:41,478 --> 01:14:42,478
What's that?

801
01:14:42,771 --> 01:14:43,814
What's that sound?

802
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:46,608
Th-There's something else on Wolmido!

803
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:49,444
Untie me and I'll tell you!

804
01:15:05,961 --> 01:15:09,380
Our infantry stands at 75,000
on four aircraft carriers,

805
01:15:09,381 --> 01:15:13,719
representing 16 countries, including
the U.S., England, France and Australia.

806
01:15:13,969 --> 01:15:18,640
260 battleships are ready to deploy
from Tokyo, Kobe, Sasebo and Busan.

807
01:15:18,932 --> 01:15:21,267
On D-Day, one regiment
from the ROK Marine Corps

808
01:15:21,268 --> 01:15:23,060
will deploy from Busan
and join us there.

809
01:15:23,061 --> 01:15:26,648
We've also recruited Korean students
from the U.S. and Japan as interpreters.

810
01:15:27,357 --> 01:15:28,357
Good.

811
01:15:30,318 --> 01:15:32,904
Deliver this message
to the X-RAY operatives.

812
01:15:34,072 --> 01:15:35,906
"Valiant men of X-RAY,

813
01:15:35,907 --> 01:15:39,910
make contact with KLO
and light the Palmido Lighthouse

814
01:15:39,911 --> 01:15:43,081
on September 15th, 0000 hours.

815
01:15:44,166 --> 01:15:45,584
Guide our fleet to the beach.

816
01:15:47,252 --> 01:15:48,252
Lastly,

817
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:52,257
may the grace of God be with you."

818
01:15:53,008 --> 01:15:55,427
Roger that.
We'll be waiting for further orders.

819
01:15:59,139 --> 01:16:00,891
We got a report from the U.S. Navy.

820
01:16:01,391 --> 01:16:03,185
"Ryu arrived safely,

821
01:16:03,518 --> 01:16:06,188
and gave us the naval mine locations.

822
01:16:06,897 --> 01:16:08,190
Here's our next mission.

823
01:16:08,899 --> 01:16:12,277
We'll depart for Palmido
at 2200 hours.

824
01:16:12,861 --> 01:16:14,654
Enemy resistance will be formidable.

825
01:16:15,405 --> 01:16:18,325
Prepare for full engagement."

826
01:16:18,992 --> 01:16:21,995
So we just need to light the lighthouse?

827
01:16:22,913 --> 01:16:23,913
Yes.

828
01:16:24,372 --> 01:16:25,498
Something wrong?

829
01:16:26,333 --> 01:16:29,419
How many enemy soldiers
do you anticipate there?

830
01:16:29,878 --> 01:16:31,963
Two squads, roughly 20 men.

831
01:16:34,341 --> 01:16:38,386
I think Ryu was referring
to the Wolmido stronghold.

832
01:16:39,179 --> 01:16:40,639
I'd like to check it out.

833
01:16:41,389 --> 01:16:43,016
Look! Over there!

834
01:16:46,228 --> 01:16:47,646
Captain! Hurry!

835
01:16:48,730 --> 01:16:51,066
<i>Citizens of Incheon!</i>

836
01:16:51,608 --> 01:16:52,400
Gather around!

837
01:16:52,401 --> 01:16:54,235
DON'T HESITATE FOR YOUR ONE AND
ONLY COUNTRY Gather around!

838
01:16:54,236 --> 01:16:55,254
DON'T HESITATE FOR YOUR
ONE AND ONLY COUNTRY

839
01:16:55,278 --> 01:16:58,614
<i>The traitors will be judged!</i>

840
01:16:58,615 --> 01:16:59,074
LOOK AT THE END OF THE REBELLION
THIS IS THE END OF U.S. IMPERIALISM

841
01:16:59,075 --> 01:17:00,491
LOOK AT THE END OF THE REBELLION THIS IS THE END OF
U.S. IMPERIALISM <i>Let us exterminate the traitors</i>

842
01:17:00,492 --> 01:17:00,909
LOOK AT THE END OF THE REBELLION
THIS IS THE END OF U.S. IMPERIALISM

843
01:17:00,910 --> 01:17:03,536
<i>and raise the red flag!</i>

844
01:17:13,546 --> 01:17:15,924
Young Master, don't be scared.

845
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:20,387
Don't ever lose your courage.

846
01:17:22,847 --> 01:17:28,520
Enough of that "Young Master."

847
01:17:29,062 --> 01:17:30,981
You're much older than I am!

848
01:17:32,357 --> 01:17:33,608
Just call me Dae-Soo.

849
01:17:35,568 --> 01:17:36,903
Do it!

850
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:38,570
I can't.

851
01:17:39,197 --> 01:17:40,323
Hurry!

852
01:17:42,951 --> 01:17:44,577
D-Dae-Soo...

853
01:17:45,078 --> 01:17:46,078
Good.

854
01:17:46,329 --> 01:17:49,708
When we're born again,

855
01:17:51,209 --> 01:17:53,503
you'll be my big brother.

856
01:17:57,215 --> 01:17:58,258
Brother...

857
01:18:01,678 --> 01:18:03,470
Dae-Soo!

858
01:18:03,471 --> 01:18:04,597
Shut up!
Dae-Soo!

859
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:09,560
Brother!

860
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:12,147
DAL-Joong!

861
01:18:15,692 --> 01:18:16,692
You son of a-

862
01:19:04,949 --> 01:19:09,120
WE WILL REWRITE KOREAN HISTORY THROUGH BLOOD
SHOOT THE PUPPET SOLDIERS ONCE AND FOR ALL

863
01:19:17,837 --> 01:19:21,006
400 km off southern tip of Jeju Island
September 13, 1950 (D-2)

864
01:19:21,007 --> 01:19:25,260
Sir, Hurricane Kezia is currently passing 400 km off the southern tip of
Jeju Island. 400 km off southern tip of Jeju Island September 13, 1950 (D-2)

865
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:27,179
Sir, Hurricane Kezia is currently passing
400 km off the southern tip of Jeju Island.

866
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:28,556
If she continues on this course,

867
01:19:28,890 --> 01:19:30,558
tomorrow night will be treacherous.

868
01:19:31,101 --> 01:19:32,977
We will not turn back!

869
01:19:33,895 --> 01:19:36,231
A long time ago I promised myself

870
01:19:37,232 --> 01:19:40,110
that I would live
as though I expected to live forever.

871
01:19:41,528 --> 01:19:45,406
Nobody grows old
by merely living a number of years.

872
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:48,827
People grow old
only by deserting their ideals.

873
01:19:49,327 --> 01:19:51,538
Years may wrinkle the skin.

874
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:55,208
However, when you give up your ideals,

875
01:19:56,042 --> 01:19:58,128
it will wrinkle the soul.

876
01:20:04,843 --> 01:20:07,846
This will not be my last campaign.

877
01:20:32,579 --> 01:20:38,126
Incheon Shore
September 14, 1950 (D-1)

878
01:20:50,221 --> 01:20:55,393
Incheon Sea
2252 hours, September 14, 1950

879
01:21:02,859 --> 01:21:04,067
Prepare to fire.

880
01:21:04,068 --> 01:21:06,237
- Prepare to fire.
- Prepare to fire.

881
01:21:06,613 --> 01:21:07,613
Prepare to fire!

882
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:08,865
Prepare to fire!

883
01:21:13,661 --> 01:21:15,163
<i>Deploy all air units.</i>

884
01:21:15,747 --> 01:21:17,165
<i>- Copy that, Sir.
- All clear.</i>

885
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:32,679
Fire.

886
01:21:42,398 --> 01:21:44,567
Wolmido Island

887
01:22:17,642 --> 01:22:19,394
Must you go to Wolmido?

888
01:22:20,728 --> 01:22:22,939
When it's safe, we'll fire a flare.

889
01:22:23,231 --> 01:22:25,149
Please let General MacArthur know.

890
01:22:26,776 --> 01:22:29,404
I understand. Godspeed.

891
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:46,004
I volunteered.

892
01:22:46,296 --> 01:22:48,423
Medics are always in need.

893
01:22:51,968 --> 01:22:55,054
Can't you come with us?

894
01:22:57,599 --> 01:22:58,808
I'll be back shortly.

895
01:23:41,768 --> 01:23:46,189
Cigarettes taste the best
after making love.

896
01:23:49,317 --> 01:23:51,527
When the war is over,
come over for dinner.

897
01:23:51,861 --> 01:23:53,863
My wife makes the best noodles.

898
01:23:54,155 --> 01:23:55,490
And a pint to boot.

899
01:24:02,205 --> 01:24:03,539
Last radio transmission, Sir.

900
01:24:03,831 --> 01:24:05,958
Captain Jang is moving
toward Wolmido Island.

901
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:09,379
He said he will light the flare once
the beach landing site has been secured.

902
01:24:28,898 --> 01:24:32,985
Palmido Island
2341 hours, September 14, 1950

903
01:24:39,826 --> 01:24:40,826
Halt!

904
01:24:45,748 --> 01:24:47,166
We have a Headquarters Pass!

905
01:25:17,739 --> 01:25:20,783
Palmido Lighthouse
2357 hours, September 14, 1950

906
01:25:21,117 --> 01:25:23,578
2358 hours, September 14, 1950

907
01:25:50,229 --> 01:25:51,355
Foe is upstairs!

908
01:26:04,869 --> 01:26:07,914
The Yankee artillery attack
will cease soon.

909
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:11,334
We will stand by until then.

910
01:27:38,629 --> 01:27:39,629
Sir, look!

911
01:27:39,797 --> 01:27:40,797
In the harbor!

912
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:47,346
And God said, "Let there be light."

913
01:27:48,890 --> 01:27:50,725
The road to Incheon is open!

914
01:27:51,475 --> 01:27:52,268
Ceasefire.

915
01:27:52,268 --> 01:27:52,935
Ceasefire!

916
01:27:52,935 --> 01:27:53,728
- Ceasefire!
- Ceasefire!

917
01:27:53,728 --> 01:27:54,437
Ceasefire!

918
01:27:54,438 --> 01:27:55,479
Deploy advance unit.

919
01:27:55,730 --> 01:27:56,897
Deploy advance unit!

920
01:27:56,898 --> 01:27:58,733
Ceasefire, all units. Ceasefire.

921
01:28:17,335 --> 01:28:19,616
Narrow Channel, Incheon Sea
0040 hours, September 15, 1950

922
01:28:23,716 --> 01:28:24,716
Come.

923
01:28:25,176 --> 01:28:26,385
Faster.

924
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:30,264
I'll turn Incheon Beach into a bloodbath!

925
01:28:31,265 --> 01:28:32,390
Come at me!

926
01:28:32,391 --> 01:28:33,476
Commander.

927
01:28:33,809 --> 01:28:34,809
We'll begin, Sir!

928
01:28:38,898 --> 01:28:39,898
Follow me!

929
01:28:52,370 --> 01:28:53,788
The time has come.

930
01:28:54,956 --> 01:28:59,376
Let's show those Yankees
what we're made of!

931
01:28:59,377 --> 01:29:00,377
Yes, Sir!

932
01:29:00,461 --> 01:29:03,047
- Battle station!
- Battle station!

933
01:29:03,839 --> 01:29:04,839
Move!

934
01:29:21,148 --> 01:29:22,148
Stop! Stop!

935
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:23,400
Stopping!

936
01:29:27,989 --> 01:29:30,574
Captain, TNT! It's TNT!

937
01:29:41,961 --> 01:29:43,504
Does General MacArthur
know about this?

938
01:29:43,796 --> 01:29:45,339
This was never reported, so he won't.

939
01:29:46,132 --> 01:29:48,259
The UN forces could be wiped out!

940
01:29:49,468 --> 01:29:50,468
What should we do?

941
01:29:51,095 --> 01:29:52,430
Do we detonate them?

942
01:29:55,850 --> 01:29:56,850
It's our duty!

943
01:29:58,019 --> 01:29:58,978
Okay!

944
01:29:58,979 --> 01:30:00,563
Bong-Po! To the beach!

945
01:30:00,730 --> 01:30:01,730
To the beach!

946
01:30:24,545 --> 01:30:26,625
Two vessels and one advance boat
have been destroyed!

947
01:30:27,506 --> 01:30:30,091
Sir, we may have missed an artillery
turret. Should we try to turn around?

948
01:30:30,092 --> 01:30:32,260
It's still low tide! We can't do that!

949
01:30:32,261 --> 01:30:34,596
The advance unit is already heading
toward the landing zone!

950
01:30:34,597 --> 01:30:36,116
Should we keep providing
cover-fire, Sir?

951
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:38,391
Increase speed as fast as possible.

952
01:30:38,392 --> 01:30:39,185
Yes, Sir!

953
01:30:39,185 --> 01:30:40,185
Increasing speed!

954
01:30:43,939 --> 01:30:46,150
Did you see
the artillery muzzle flash?

955
01:30:46,734 --> 01:30:47,401
Yes!

956
01:30:47,401 --> 01:30:48,110
Head for it!

957
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:49,611
Toward the turret!

958
01:30:49,612 --> 01:30:50,612
Captain...

959
01:31:02,124 --> 01:31:03,124
Brother!

960
01:31:14,845 --> 01:31:15,638
Captain!

961
01:31:15,846 --> 01:31:16,846
Captain!

962
01:31:17,598 --> 01:31:18,307
Captain!

963
01:31:18,307 --> 01:31:19,307
Slow down.

964
01:31:19,558 --> 01:31:20,768
Go slow, slow!

965
01:31:22,019 --> 01:31:23,019
Slow.

966
01:31:50,548 --> 01:31:51,549
On the double!

967
01:31:52,007 --> 01:31:53,008
Plant faster!

968
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:55,886
Take the left, left!

969
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:00,640
Stop!

970
01:32:07,106 --> 01:32:08,106
Move them faster!

971
01:32:16,448 --> 01:32:19,243
MacArthur will be
in the vanguard battleship.

972
01:32:26,250 --> 01:32:28,668
Destroy the vanguard battleship first!

973
01:32:28,669 --> 01:32:29,795
3.5 Left!

974
01:32:30,045 --> 01:32:31,505
2.3 Up!

975
01:32:38,095 --> 01:32:39,388
Load cannon!

976
01:32:39,805 --> 01:32:40,848
Loading cannon!

977
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:02,160
Jang Hak-Soo...

978
01:33:18,010 --> 01:33:19,386
Reverse! Reverse!

979
01:33:46,330 --> 01:33:47,998
Finish all the work!

980
01:34:01,929 --> 01:34:02,929
Follow me!

981
01:34:03,889 --> 01:34:05,599
Get rid of them!

982
01:34:32,584 --> 01:34:34,878
Sir, that might have been
Captain Jang and his men.

983
01:34:35,129 --> 01:34:36,129
What should we do?

984
01:34:37,298 --> 01:34:38,674
Stand by.

985
01:34:42,011 --> 01:34:43,387
The water is receding, Sir.

986
01:34:43,721 --> 01:34:46,055
For our troops to make
a successful landing,

987
01:34:46,056 --> 01:34:48,725
the entire fleet needs enough time
to pass through the narrow waterway.

988
01:34:48,726 --> 01:34:52,229
Sir, if we wait another hour, our chances
of landing will drop significantly.

989
01:34:52,521 --> 01:34:55,149
- We should take-
- I said stand by, goddamnit.

990
01:34:57,609 --> 01:34:58,736
Wait for the signal.

991
01:35:23,719 --> 01:35:24,719
Fire!

992
01:35:43,405 --> 01:35:44,405
Retreat!

993
01:35:56,668 --> 01:35:58,045
Bong-Po, let's move!

994
01:36:00,589 --> 01:36:01,589
Bong-Po!

995
01:36:11,809 --> 01:36:12,809
Bong-Po!

996
01:36:19,149 --> 01:36:20,149
Bong-Po!

997
01:36:20,359 --> 01:36:21,944
Wake up! Come on! Bong-Po!

998
01:36:22,319 --> 01:36:23,319
Bong-Po!

999
01:36:25,989 --> 01:36:28,367
We have to get out of here!
On your feet!

1000
01:36:35,165 --> 01:36:36,500
Hurry...

1001
01:36:41,713 --> 01:36:42,714
Stay put.

1002
01:37:30,053 --> 01:37:33,056
Just tell me Captain Jang fired
that flare gun.

1003
01:37:33,474 --> 01:37:35,017
I believe so, Sir.

1004
01:37:38,479 --> 01:37:40,898
Initiate Operation Chromite!

1005
01:38:10,511 --> 01:38:12,346
Hey, Jang Hak-Soo!

1006
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:18,268
Come on out!

1007
01:38:35,369 --> 01:38:37,454
What's there to communism?

1008
01:38:39,540 --> 01:38:42,124
It's all about wanting
a better life together, isn't it?

1009
01:38:42,125 --> 01:38:43,919
Fucking rat...

1010
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:48,632
No matter what you Yankee puppets do,

1011
01:38:49,675 --> 01:38:53,637
the red flag will march forward!

1012
01:39:03,689 --> 01:39:04,982
Jang Hak-Soo...

1013
01:39:07,776 --> 01:39:10,028
I sentence you to death

1014
01:39:10,445 --> 01:39:12,406
for tainting the people
with your betrayal!

1015
01:39:22,916 --> 01:39:24,376
Let's put an end to this.

1016
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:14,300
JANG HAK-SOO KILLED ME

1017
01:40:15,636 --> 01:40:19,076
THE U.S. IMPERIALISTIC PUPPET JANG HAK-SOO!
TAKE ALL OF THE U.S. IMPERIALISTIC PUPPETS!

1018
01:41:22,661 --> 01:41:23,662
<i>Mother...</i>

1019
01:41:25,414 --> 01:41:27,082
<i>I went to see you yesterday,</i>

1020
01:41:27,916 --> 01:41:31,086
<i>but I turned back
without saying goodbye.</i>

1021
01:41:33,505 --> 01:41:38,009
<i>I was afraid that I wouldn't be
able to walk away.</i>

1022
01:41:40,387 --> 01:41:41,388
<i>Mother...</i>

1023
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:46,727
<i>To complete my assignment,</i>

1024
01:41:48,270 --> 01:41:49,938
<i>I chose our country.</i>

1025
01:41:53,191 --> 01:41:57,487
<i>It's unfilial for the child
to die before his parent.</i>

1026
01:42:00,449 --> 01:42:02,284
<i>I wanted to be by your side.</i>

1027
01:42:05,829 --> 01:42:06,829
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1028
01:42:09,291 --> 01:42:11,293
<i>I'll watch over you from above.</i>

1029
01:42:40,113 --> 01:42:41,573
You said...

1030
01:42:43,325 --> 01:42:44,576
you'd come back.

1031
01:43:41,716 --> 01:43:44,302
Honey, look carefully for Dad.

1032
01:43:47,055 --> 01:43:49,975
- Watch out for him.
- Yes, Mom!

1033
01:43:57,315 --> 01:44:01,278
Don't be so disappointed
if you don't see Captain Jang today.

1034
01:44:02,153 --> 01:44:03,488
Don't worry.

1035
01:44:04,155 --> 01:44:06,407
Whether he's close or far,

1036
01:44:06,783 --> 01:44:08,368
dead or alive,

1037
01:44:10,245 --> 01:44:15,208
my son will always be by my side.

1038
01:44:20,964 --> 01:44:22,007
Hak-Soo!

1039
01:44:22,716 --> 01:44:23,716
Hak-Soo!

1040
01:44:52,996 --> 01:44:56,875
I was born in Masan
but grew up in Incheon.

1041
01:44:57,208 --> 01:45:01,087
I have great eyesight,
so I shoot really well. And I cook well.

1042
01:45:01,421 --> 01:45:05,258
I have someone to protect.

1043
01:45:05,550 --> 01:45:09,178
I'd like to do something meaningful.

1044
01:45:09,179 --> 01:45:13,516
I hope to use my shady skills
to save my country.

1045
01:45:14,768 --> 01:45:16,895
I lost all my family to this war.

1046
01:45:17,103 --> 01:45:18,897
I come from a family
of freedom fighters.

1047
01:45:19,606 --> 01:45:22,816
We should be fighting
for our own country.

1048
01:45:22,817 --> 01:45:24,653
I heard we get a ton of rice.

1049
01:45:24,945 --> 01:45:26,529
I have too many kids to feed.

1050
01:45:26,863 --> 01:45:28,949
I reproduced like rabbits.

1051
01:45:31,993 --> 01:45:32,993
All right.

1052
01:45:33,244 --> 01:45:34,663
Shall we take a photo?

1053
01:45:55,350 --> 01:45:58,644
To the 15 men who died
during Mission X-RAY,

1054
01:45:58,645 --> 01:46:02,149
including Lieutenant Lim Byung-Re,
Sergeant Hong Si-Wook and members of KLO,

1055
01:46:02,150 --> 01:46:05,275
and those who sacrificed their lives
for Korea's freedom and peace,

1056
01:46:05,276 --> 01:46:08,238
we dedicate this film
to them and their families.

1057
01:46:10,448 --> 01:46:13,367
13 clays after the successful
landing operation of Incheon,

1058
01:46:13,368 --> 01:46:17,329
on September 15, 1950,
the UN Allied Forces reclaimed Seoul.

1059
01:46:17,330 --> 01:46:20,791
They went on to take Pyeongyang,
but the Chinese army drove them back.

1060
01:46:20,792 --> 01:46:23,127
On July 27, 1953,
an armistice was reached,

1061
01:46:23,128 --> 01:46:57,007
drawing the war to an end after 3 years
with over 3 million casualties.
