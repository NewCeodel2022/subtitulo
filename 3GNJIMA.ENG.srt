1
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,830
No identification is intended or should be confused...

2
00:00:29,832 --> 00:00:31,030
...with real people, companies or organizations.

3
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,440
Finally, the fourth floor.

4
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,540
I'm very nervous!

5
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,210
What the hell! I'm so scared.

6
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:48,850
That is scary...

7
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,240
Damn! Do not mess with me!

8
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,360
You are a chicken.

9
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,120
It is not this? 402?

10
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,530
Really exist.

11
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,080
This shit is great.

12
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,986
Hey Hae-chan. You said we wouldn't go in.

13
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,630
But we are right in front of room 402.

14
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:09,830
You see it? 402!

15
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,680
We are not chickens like you. We are real men!

16
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,070
Now we will open it and leave.

17
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,470
You thought we wouldn't make it. But we did it!

18
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,820
We are real men, asshole!

19
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,680
We are opening the door! Hold this.

20
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,390
We are doing it for real!

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,400
It does not work.

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,230
Stop kidding!

23
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,240
It does not open. I do not know how...

24
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:33,810
You are a coward.

25
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,520
- What was that? - That?

26
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,850
Wait.

27
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,970
Hello everyone. You must have seen this on Youtube.

28
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,470
The high school students who disappeared in Gonjiam.

29
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,540
Then what should I do?

30
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,780
I have checked if the video is fake.

31
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,980
The teenagers disappeared in their horror experience.

32
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,980
This is real.

33
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,620
And the ghost photo doesn't look fake.

34
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,550
So!

35
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,401
Our next stop...

36
00:02:24,451 --> 00:02:27,530
...for the "Horror Times" horror experience squad is...

37
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,530
...one of the three most haunted houses in Korea...

38
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,899
...and one of the 7 strangest places on the planet!

39
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,800
Namyoung Psychiatric Hospital.

40
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:41,269
Since its inauguration in May 1961, it was the best mental hospital in Korea,

41
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:46,240
but closed in October 1979 after a mass suicide of patients

42
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,809
and the disappearance of its director.

43
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,520
The building is still standing, but abandoned.

44
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,720
Gonjiam Haven, friends!

45
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,620
footage!

46
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:57,790
No. 1026.

47
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,330
The 11th Awards Ceremony...

48
00:03:00,332 --> 00:03:03,330
...to the citizens was celebrated in the "Blue House".

49
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:07,829
The grand prize goes to Park Young-ae,

50
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:11,069
Director of Namyoung Psychiatric Hospital,

51
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:15,909
which recognizes his achievements in treating not only mental patients,

52
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:19,410
but also of political prisoners and brutal criminals.

53
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,410
There are numerous rumors about the Gonjiam Asylum.

54
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:24,830
Some say it was built...

55
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,849
...in the place where the Japanese brutally murdered...

56
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,049
...and buried the Korean resistance...

57
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,960
...so no one could trace the bodies.

58
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:38,829
Or was it the national torture center in the 1960s and 1970s disguised as an asylum...

59
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:42,069
...or that the mass suicide was really murders carried out by the principal...

60
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:45,370
...who later committed suicide, and did not disappear.

61
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,809
So there are countless reports of ghost sightings...

62
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,739
...and testimonials of crying after the closure of the asylum.

63
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,349
The biggest rumor among all is about room 402,

64
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,750
the only enclosed space in the asylum.

65
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,980
They say that whoever dares to open that room will be cursed to death.

66
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,150
So we'll go to Gonjiam Asylum,

67
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:08,989
on October 26, the day it closed, to investigate the truth

68
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:15,100
about supernatural phenomena and ghosts that many people witnessed.

69
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:16,770
Do you want to join?

70
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,480
I am on the terrace of a cafe in Gangnam.

71
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,080
I guess I'm the first. I will wait for others to come.

72
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,550
- For "Horror Times"? - Yeah.

73
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,820
- Hello. - Hello.

74
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,320
- Are you filming me? - Yeah.

75
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,059
Yes, my family is in the United States...

76
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,890
...and I'm here with my dance group.

77
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,059
Awesome.

78
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,500
- What do you do for a living? - I'm studying nursing...

79
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:50,300
- Guys must like you! - I'm in a women's college.

80
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,900
Is not the?

81
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,640
Are here!

82
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,840
Hello everyone.

83
00:04:58,910 --> 00:04:59,780
Hello.

84
00:04:59,781 --> 00:05:01,850
- Nice to meet you. - Hello.

85
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,649
Let's do a presentation.

86
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:06,650
Clear!

87
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,290
These are the selected candidates:

88
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,790
Ah-yeon, Park Ji-hyun, and...

89
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,230
- ¡Charlotte!
- Charlotte Moon.

90
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,560
Y de "Horror Times",

91
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,230
Lee Seung-wook, Park Sung-hun.

92
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,160
- Hello. - Hello.

93
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,499
Seung-wook will be MC...

94
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,770
...and Sung-hun will operate the first camera.

95
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,440
And do you know who I am? Ha-joon, the squad captain.

96
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,980
- It's like a group date. - Correct.

97
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:34,110
- I didn't mean that... - Just stop talking.

98
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,449
It seems that one is missing.

99
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,220
- As if you've seen a ghost... - Isn't he?

100
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,320
I guess so.

101
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,350
- Call? - Here!

102
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,860
- Here! - Come here!

103
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,390
Yes please come here!

104
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,890
Here it comes!

105
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,169
Hello, are you here for "Horror Times"?

106
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:57,400
- Hello! - Sorry, I got lost.

107
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,800
Je-yoon will do the editing and graphic effects.

108
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,239
Ji-hyun, the second camera.

109
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,240
And a Gopro camera for every two.

110
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,940
Please, memorize the plan and the indication sheet.

111
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,750
What are you doing?

112
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,620
It's for the damn documentary.

113
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,730
- Health! - To the bottom!

114
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,530
- Nice to meet you! - Health!

115
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,099
Where have you been among CNN's seven weirdest places?

116
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,230
The Sedlec Ossuary in the Czech Republic, the Island of the Dolls in Mexico,

117
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,639
and the Aokigahara Forest in Japan.

118
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,640
I have been to three places.

119
00:06:32,641 --> 00:06:36,239
Everyone who saw the ghost in Gonjiam...

120
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,810
...they first heard a sound.

121
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,310
- Do you mean a ping pong ball? - You're right.

122
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,420
The people who saw the ghosts there heard a ping pong ball.

123
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,660
But why that specific sound?

124
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:50,030
Actually, there is a ping pong table. Broken in half.

125
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:54,330
Couldn't it be the echo of the water drops?

126
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,339
But why did the director kill all her patients?

127
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,970
There is no proof that she killed them.

128
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,380
People say that since all the patients died...

129
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,780
...and the director disappeared.

130
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,780
Rumor also says that she hanged herself in the hospital bathroom.

131
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,890
Its neck was apparently stretched out about a foot long.

132
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,390
Disgusting...

133
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,290
Re scared?

134
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:17,930
I?

135
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,830
No.

136
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,430
- You seem to be. - No way!

137
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:26,129
Whose idea was it to broadcast this live?

138
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,639
A car racing club went up...

139
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:34,039
...the video of his run on his website a while ago.

140
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,179
It reached 200,000 views and earned over $100,000 from ads.

141
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,610
- 100 thousand dollars? - Yeah.

142
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,350
Can you make money streaming this kind of stuff?

143
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,050
Hell yes...

144
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,459
I guess you're some kind of student...

145
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,090
...who learns everything by the rules.

146
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,629
He never breaks the rules.

147
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,959
- She is cute. - Yes, very pretty but...

148
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,759
- ...learn everything by the rules. - Stop.

149
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,530
Not from experiences...

150
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,730
How many views do you expect?

151
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,370
- One million! - One million?

152
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,039
I'm aiming for that.

153
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,810
- Difficult. - You mean a million?

154
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,110
It means winning $500,000 since that is 5 times more than 200,000 views.

155
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,680
Captain.

156
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,050
I really think we should send her home.

157
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:19,620
Because?

158
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,820
- Ready? - Clear.

159
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,089
My God!

160
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,159
- I catch it? - I can not believe it!

161
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,600
I catch it!

162
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,800
Incredible!

163
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,800
- He got it! TRUE? - Let me see!

164
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,140
Impossible!

165
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:41,310
How do you do that?

166
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,380
hurry up

167
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,780
Just throw it!

168
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,880
Shoot!

169
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,820
Hey!

170
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,120
My God, I'm so sorry.

171
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,120
I think we really should send her home.

172
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,660
- Come here. - Please...

173
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,960
- By millions of views! - Millions of views!

174
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,300
Health!

175
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,810
Nobody saw the ghost of the director.

176
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,079
Don't you think her spirit should be there too?

177
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,940
You're right.

178
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,950
But people only saw the patients and a high school girl.

179
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:24,590
Patients, I get it. But why a high school girl?

180
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,420
About 30 years ago?

181
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,659
Three high school girls went there to test their nerves...

182
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,160
...and were found unconscious while trying to open room 402.

183
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,299
They were immediately sent to the hospital.

184
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,669
Two of them went crazy and committed suicide.

185
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:43,369
The other remained unconscious. That was what I heard.

186
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:47,370
That is why there is a rumor that room 402 is cursed.

187
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,609
What is our plan for room 402?

188
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:53,250
The climax of this experience will be opening the door.

189
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,920
- You never mentioned that. - Brilliant!

190
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,469
It's more fun to find out by surprise.

191
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,040
We are opening it! Yeah!

192
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:06,340
- Aren't we all going in? - Because?

193
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,580
Are you afraid?

194
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,610
Hell no!

195
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,520
You are very good at joking.

196
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,120
Seriously, who's going to open that door?

197
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,520
- Guys, are you ready? - Yeah.

198
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:21,225
let's get started

199
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,330
Come on, come on, come on!

200
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,700
- No! - Come in, please!

201
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,200
No, hell no!

202
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,770
You already have it!

203
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,579
Wait wait.

204
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,009
- Come on Je-yoon, come on Je-yoon! - I can not accept it.

205
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,809
- Someone tampered with it. - What are you saying?

206
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,479
Horror Times does no such thing!

207
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,980
Something is wrong with this.

208
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,690
Are you afraid? I can go with you.

209
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,550
Take care of yourself.

210
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,860
Why are you shaking?

211
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,830
It's calm.

212
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,200
He saw us!

213
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,440
¡Hope!

214
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,050
¡Hope!

215
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,460
Wait!

216
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,460
Let's go now.

217
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,460
Awesome.

218
00:11:15,461 --> 00:11:17,100
- Can that follow us? - Of course!

219
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,579
Anyway, we won't be able to enter if we arrive early.

220
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,250
Let's have some fun.

221
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:34,289
Do you mean go for a dip like in previous horror experiences?

222
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,760
We are almost in November.

223
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:10,290
You have reached your destination.

224
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,630
There.

225
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,660
That's the entrance all barricaded.

226
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,739
They have blocked it!

227
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,510
- We can't get in here. - So how will we get through?

228
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,539
We'll go in the back.

229
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,540
Police patrol here even at night.

230
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,550
- Oh really? - Yeah.

231
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,620
Check it out.

232
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,650
Can this car go in?

233
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,760
It's great.

234
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,530
This is scary.

235
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,370
- We are here. - Let's get out of here.

236
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,030
At last!

237
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,840
- It must be heavy. - Aren't you helping?

238
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,610
Hey, look at the camera.

239
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,250
Here.

240
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,820
Shall we go to the top?

241
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:11,820
Yeah.

242
00:13:11,821 --> 00:13:14,820
The hospital is right in front of us. Why should we climb this hill?

243
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,289
There are surveillance cameras.

244
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,460
My head hurts.

245
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,860
- Can't you see this? - Why do you wear heels?

246
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,999
Hey, hurry up!

247
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,170
¡Je-yoon!

248
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,340
Are you OK?

249
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:32,640
Is this a horror club...

250
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,580
...or an extreme sports club?

251
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,550
A drone camera follows us from above.

252
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,350
Hello!

253
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:44,820
Let's go.

254
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,160
Do it well!

255
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,170
- Help me with this. - That?

256
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,380
It's so cosy.

257
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,130
It is 9:25 PM.

258
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,769
Sung-hun and Seung-wook are in Gonjiam Asylum...

259
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,840
...to install the cameras.

260
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,040
I wish they didn't find the ghosts too soon.

261
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,010
We have ghosts here too.

262
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,110
My cap!

263
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,050
The camera is on.

264
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,250
Okay, they're in.

265
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,560
Seung-wook that's good.

266
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,659
Good with the angles and positions.

267
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,360
No jokes.

268
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,370
The camera has moved automatically.

269
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,079
This is a tracking camera. The camera follows the movement.

270
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,810
Everything is new to you, girl.

271
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:17,250
- She is so pretty. - We should send her home.

272
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,450
¡Sung-hun! ¡Seung-wook!

273
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,060
Good job!

274
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,830
It's cold when it gets dark.

275
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,460
hurry up The store is hot.

276
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,060
How was Gojiam?

277
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,600
It is there...

278
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,770
Good job. Did you see the ghost?

279
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,410
They haven't arrived yet.

280
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,840
I am so hungry.

281
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,479
- Good job. - Really.

282
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,009
I'm starving. We should eat something.

283
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:49,549
- Darling! - I'm making noodles now.

284
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,049
Good girl. You're smart in that way.

285
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,750
- Are you doing it now? - Yeah.

286
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,160
- Let's eat. - It's done.

287
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,660
- Settle down. - Do we have a ladle?

288
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,540
It's good.

289
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,740
Are you OK?

290
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,310
Water please.

291
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,580
Are you OK?

292
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:21,780
No I'm not.

293
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,789
- Wow, GoPro sessions! - Great!

294
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,720
- There are many! - Will we all use it?

295
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:29,790
Of course.

296
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,920
What is this?

297
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,320
Electromagnetic field meter.

298
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:35,929
What would it be like in Korean?

299
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,300
A ghost detector.

300
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,269
An electromagnetic field detector to be exact.

301
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:43,100
The special magnetic field flows where the psychotic flow occurs.

302
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:47,170
So people use this to detect spirits.

303
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,540
We usually call this meter EMF.

304
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,620
It fits there.

305
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,629
I'm pinning it in case you take it off when you get really scared.

306
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,160
You can only remove it here.

307
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,260
It makes me more nervous.

308
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,330
Tighter, tighter!

309
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:15,440
Tightest.

310
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,700
Yes, tighter!

311
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:22,910
With this you can record your face and your point of view at the same time.

312
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,040
- Oh. - You see.

313
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,580
Great!

314
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,690
- Brilliant? - Yeah.

315
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:38,090
So it's almost working hours for the ghosts.

316
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,099
Everyone must be nervous.

317
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,130
Let's go?

318
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,440
- Yeah! - Let's go!

319
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,040
Check Ah-yeon's front camera and Je-yoon's POV camera.

320
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,140
I do not receive them.

321
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,980
And now?

322
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:04,209
Alright. Sound test. Say your name.

323
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,210
Sung-hyun.

324
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:05,860
Seung-wook.

325
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,150
Charlotte.

326
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:08,510
Ji-hyun.

327
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,450
¡Je-yoon!

328
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,120
Ah-yeon.

329
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,590
Sound check done.

330
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,460
Hey.

331
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,060
I already feel chills.

332
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,230
- Something could come to light. - TRUE?

333
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,930
Should we use the EMF?

334
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,040
Already? We're not even close to the entrance.

335
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,540
What what?

336
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,609
- Something just happened. - I heard a flutter.

337
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,679
- Was it a bird? - Bird?

338
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,480
That scared me.

339
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,380
Damn.

340
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,350
Stay still, my heart.

341
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:49,189
It's just that it came out so suddenly. I'm not afraid of anything.

342
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:52,600
- You look scared. - No.

343
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,249
- You're lying. - I'm not!

344
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,550
Do not lie.

345
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,990
Why are you laughing?

346
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:06,760
What's that?

347
00:19:07,362 --> 00:19:08,628
What the fuck?

348
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:09,699
That?

349
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,400
- What is it? - What is it?

350
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,070
¡Dinos!

351
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,940
Do not touch it.

352
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,280
What exactly happened?

353
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,220
Leave it there. We can use it as a brand.

354
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,980
- Good. - Good idea.

355
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,290
Someone's underwear as a brand...

356
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,999
We have passed 12,000 views.

357
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,040
We're going on the air in 5 minutes.

358
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,050
Carefully.

359
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:06,590
Be careful.

360
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,290
Be careful with the steps.

361
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,360
Why do you wear heels?

362
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,700
Be careful!

363
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,738
Are you OK?

364
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,840
Careful!

365
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:28,040
Give me your hand, Ah-yeon.

366
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,910
It's slippery here.

367
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,710
Be careful, Charlotte.

368
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,610
Thank you.

369
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,750
Look over there.

370
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,020
Great.

371
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,520
Damn.

372
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,190
So the top floor is the fourth?

373
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,370
Yes, the basement is the first floor here.

374
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,470
Where is room 402?

375
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,870
I can't tell from the outside.

376
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,510
Rumor has it that if you shit in there, you can do it big.

377
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,879
You should have told me earlier! I already shit!

378
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,210
Damn.

379
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,720
Let's go!

380
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,950
Be careful.

381
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:16,490
That?

382
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,820
Lights out, everyone!

383
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,760
Cover up the LED lights!

384
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,500
- Cover them. - That?

385
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,830
It's not patrol time.

386
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,030
He is a police officer?

387
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,870
Shut up and wait.

388
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,120
They left?

389
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:08,340
This place is crazy.

390
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,790
What are you doing, Ji-hyun?

391
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:27,690
- Come here. - I'm coming.

392
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,400
- Let's move together. - It's so scary.

393
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:35,200
I'm afraid.

394
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:56,590
Look!

395
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,990
This is the main entrance that leads to the second floor.

396
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,560
Let's go in.

397
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,030
Forward.

398
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,700
Wait for me.

399
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,400
It's frightening.

400
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,440
You will not come?

401
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,240
I need to film from behind.

402
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,210
OK.

403
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,080
I want to pee.

404
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:25,250
I am filming. You go ahead. I'll film from behind.

405
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:26,990
I have it.

406
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,460
- Shall we continue? - Yeah.

407
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:38,330
Shit, what am I supposed to do? It is real?

408
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,070
It's really scary.

409
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,540
What is written on it?

410
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:50,310
"Go inside and you will die."

411
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,880
And "Fuck it" afterwards...

412
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,510
Time to start broadcasting.

413
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,420
Hey, meet up here. We are starting!

414
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,180
OK!

415
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,490
get ready.

416
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,320
Three, two, one.

417
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,230
Come on!

418
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:10,219
We, the Horror Times horror squad,

419
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,790
we managed to sneak into the forbidden Gonjiam Asylum.

420
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:18,860
Today is October 26. And it's just past midnight.

421
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,270
We can already feel the cold in this building...

422
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,240
...where the spirits are said to appear at midnight.

423
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:29,640
Korea's first live horror show!

424
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,380
Gonjiam's Horror Experience...

425
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,380
...starts now!

426
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,820
Very good opening, Seung-wook.

427
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,290
RV first and get in!

428
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:39,650
- Hurry, hurry! - Come on!

429
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:48,130
Music!

430
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,200
- Enters. - Get in.

431
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,620
Seung-wook, get ready.

432
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,920
Now!

433
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,920
It's twelve past four at night.

434
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:18,960
We are finally inside the Gonjiam Asylum.

435
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,229
Here is the hall.

436
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:27,370
"Someone is living here..."

437
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,540
It's giving me a chill.

438
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,740
You always have chills.

439
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,910
What do you want me to have? Suffocation?

440
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,550
Wait.

441
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:42,650
Here is the hallway on the second floor.

442
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:49,220
The rooms are aligned on both sides.

443
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:55,130
There is a lot of garbage on the floor.

444
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:59,870
We approach the reception desk.

445
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:02,440
Ji-hyun and Charlotte, go ahead.

446
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,380
What the fuck?

447
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,880
Where is? Is here.

448
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,420
Here.

449
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,380
Ji-hyun, get ready. Now!

450
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,819
Charlotte pours the holy water...

451
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:38,090
which he took from Myung-dong Cathedral in a container.

452
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,730
Let's put up a camera and capture ghosts.

453
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:51,600
Seung-wook, your line.

454
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,510
We already installed the high-tech equipment...

455
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:01,180
...at points of supernatural phenomena and ghost appearances.

456
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,020
Let me summarize the report of...

457
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,990
What was that?

458
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,720
Where?

459
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:10,820
Where was?

460
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,790
Was it in the principal's room?

461
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:15,030
It closed itself. It is not like this?

462
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,529
This is real, folks.

463
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:20,970
The door to the director's room closed by itself.

464
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,170
We'll go and check it out.

465
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:32,680
I am horrified.

466
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,790
DIRECTOR'S ROOM

467
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:16,720
Now we are in the director's room.

468
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,930
Might be a coincidence but

469
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:23,460
It may be a coincidence, but just before, the door closed by itself.

470
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:29,969
It is the phenomenon that many people who came here witnessed.

471
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:30,910
Check this out!

472
00:28:30,911 --> 00:28:32,470
- That? - Come here, quickly!

473
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,010
Sung-hun, zoom in on the photo.

474
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,150
Seung-wook your line.

475
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,650
Seung-wook your line.

476
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:46,850
It looks like a group photo of hospital patients and staff.

477
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,520
It looks like an ordinary group photo,

478
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,590
but if you look closer, something is wrong.

479
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:55,360
- Everyone looks at... - Different directions...

480
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,029
And the woman in the center appears to be...

481
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:02,000
...the director who is rumored to have killed all the patients and disappeared.

482
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,070
- She looks creepy. - I agree.

483
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:06,510
We found other photos.

484
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,210
The director receiving the award.

485
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:15,279
Playing ping pong.

486
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,950
I guess this lady liked ping pong.

487
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,750
That may explain the sound of the ping pong ball.

488
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:21,060
Stop! You scare me!

489
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,560
What's that? Over there...

490
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:34,270
Says. "People who read".

491
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,410
It seems that people read some books back then.

492
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,810
- From President Park Jung-hee. - This is a surprise!

493
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:45,450
- By the way, who is Park Jung-hee? - Former president.

494
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:49,680
Ex-president, father of the director.

495
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:52,150
Was your father also president?

496
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,490
Charlotte...

497
00:29:59,030 --> 00:29:59,960
What the hell?

498
00:29:59,961 --> 00:30:02,600
- I was surprised... - This is really crazy.

499
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:04,900
Is that hair?

500
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:08,570
- Isn't that a person? - No.

501
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,770
Let's get this over with.

502
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,680
Luckily we have found some photos and we have shown them to you.

503
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,880
Sung-hun and I are going to prepare...

504
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,050
...the ritual medium to draw out vengeful spirits...

505
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:29,089
...of the patients who were unjustly murdered.

506
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:30,359
Meanwhile, the other members...

507
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:35,430
...you will be introduced to the horror sites on the 1st, 3rd and 4th floors.

508
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,270
Everything will be live, of course.

509
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,068
OK.

510
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,900
Everyone, move to the spots and wait while I put on the replay.

511
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:44,439
For supernatural phenomena and the appearance of ghosts.

512
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,910
Let me summarize the report of...

513
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,520
Charlotte and Ji-hyun on the first floor, ready?

514
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,520
Yeah!

515
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,290
Time for horror sites.

516
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:14,900
Ready, let's go!

517
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,800
I'm on the first floor now.

518
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:24,640
And Charlotte, who has already experienced 3 of CNN's 7 Weirdest Places,

519
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:27,810
is leaving his signature to celebrate his fourth experience.

520
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,280
¿Charlotte?

521
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,140
Hello everyone!

522
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:34,719
After the Sedlec Ossuary in the Czech Republic,

523
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,549
the Aokigahara Forest in Japan and the Island of the Dolls in Mexico,

524
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,690
among CNN's 7 Weirdest Places,

525
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,130
I, Charlotte, finally made it to the Gonjiam Asylum!

526
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:48,800
I left my signature as a souvenir, just like in the other places.

527
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,400
And I can see that someone wrote "Let's live" here.

528
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,800
It's scary.

529
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:58,270
Move to the hall.

530
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,510
It says, "Someone lives here."

531
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,680
That?

532
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:09,250
No, it says it's ghosts that live here.

533
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,150
Damn. Ghosts live here, folks.

534
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,620
And we are in the place where the ghosts live.

535
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:20,430
And there are strange writings on the wall.

536
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:21,530
Ji-hyun.

537
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,170
Look at this.

538
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,900
Why is this off?

539
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,769
LABORATORY

540
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:32,510
This is the lab, folks.

541
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,340
Let's go in.

542
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:53,930
What the hell?

543
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,000
The interior looks like the laboratory.

544
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,840
Water on the floor.

545
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:06,440
The water is dripping.

546
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,680
Numerous medical charts scattered on the floor.

547
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:13,510
There are also traces of fire on the wall.

548
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:18,850
Cabinets collapsed on the floor.

549
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,690
Here is the laboratory.

550
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,720
There are tiles on the walls,

551
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:33,660
and most of them are smashed as if the room had been bombed.

552
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:38,430
On the floor are IVs, needles...

553
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:41,440
...and a microscope.

554
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:46,670
There are also many medicine bottles.

555
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,850
And also a doll.

556
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:56,850
Ji-hyun.

557
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,720
It is the place where my friend took the psychic photo.

558
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,220
Look at it.

559
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:07,290
This is the place where my friend took the photo...

560
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,599
...when he came here last year.

561
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,800
It was real. Point the camera at me.

562
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:16,270
Are you OK?

563
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:18,670
- What is this? - What the hell?

564
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,740
- What's that smell? - God...

565
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:24,850
Is that a chicken?

566
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:28,780
Let's go. Let's get out of here.

567
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:32,850
Good job to both of you. Move to the fourth floor.

568
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,289
Je-yoon and Ah-yeon on the third floor.

569
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:36,420
Ready and go!

570
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,960
Welcome back.

571
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:43,300
Ah-yeon and I are in the hallway on the third floor.

572
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:47,330
We're only one floor up

573
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,170
but it's colder here.

574
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:53,710
We'll check the temperature.

575
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,510
¿Ah-yeon?

576
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:58,910
It's 13 degrees Celsius.

577
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,680
13 degrees Celsius.

578
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:05,290
It's 13 degrees Celsius on the third floor.

579
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,960
And the second floor before?

580
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,060
13 degrees Celsius.

581
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,460
The temperature is the same.

582
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:22,170
But there is a thing called sensory temperature.

583
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,739
The sensory temperature I feel on the third floor right now...

584
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:29,179
...it's minus 13 degrees Celsius.

585
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,980
- There is a ping pong table! - That?

586
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,680
There really is a ping pong table as the rumors say.

587
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,720
There is a dead bird.

588
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:46,960
Je-yoon, calm down a bit.

589
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:58,810
And now that?

590
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:01,210
Introducing the third floor!

591
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:07,580
Ok, now we will show you the rooms on the third floor.

592
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,020
They should know too

593
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:15,720
people who have been here often say they witnessed

594
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,490
supernatural phenomena on the 1st and 2nd floor

595
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,170
and real ghosts here on this floor and on the 4th floor.

596
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,370
They are said to be haunted spirits of wrongly murdered patients.

597
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:36,180
Now let's... check these rooms.

598
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,940
What the hell...

599
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:06,570
Je-yoon your line.

600
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,879
Alright.

601
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:14,950
This is the shower room where the ghosts were seen many times.

602
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,590
You can see on that wall...

603
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:24,490
...an old blob in the shape of a person.

604
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,590
Please expand it, Ah-yeon.

605
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:33,970
- It looks like a person. - It is what is called "phantom point".

606
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:37,500
That we don't want to believe...

607
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:42,610
Anyway, we, the horror experience squad,

608
00:37:42,612 --> 00:37:46,410
we set up this trail camera and a Gopro

609
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:53,290
at this highest point, to confirm the existence of the ghost.

610
00:37:55,360 --> 00:38:02,730
Now we are finally going further into the shower room.

611
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,250
Here we are.

612
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:26,950
I can see...

613
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,390
Over there! That!

614
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:32,460
What is it? What's that?

615
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,230
Curse! What is it?

616
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:51,510
Shit...

617
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,900
It's a wig.

618
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:58,610
Shit, put that down!

619
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,540
It's frightening! put it away

620
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,579
I said stop that! Do not do that!

621
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,210
No! Damn!

622
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:05,580
No! I'm warning you!

623
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:09,080
- Damn... - Why is he here?

624
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:12,790
Someone must have left it as a joke.

625
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:15,189
Do not do that! I'm warning you!

626
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:18,530
I'm serious! Do you think I'm kidding?

627
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,700
That's all on the 3rd floor...

628
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,860
Ji-hyun and Charlotte on the fourth floor, get ready.

629
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:25,850
Action!

630
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,670
This is the fourth floor corridor, the scariest point of the asylum.

631
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:35,980
Here's our state-of-the-art ghost tracking equipment.

632
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:39,780
The ceiling is equipped with 6 flash lights with infrared sensor...

633
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:44,520
...that respond to the slightest movement and the least amount of energy.

634
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:47,920
Now we will only have to wait until the ghost appears.

635
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,090
Now to Ji-hyun.

636
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:56,400
This is the climax of the horror experience, the infamous room 402...

637
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,570
...where no one has been since the hospital closed.

638
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,900
The room used to be the intensive care room.

639
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:07,040
Many people challenging the Gonjiam Asylum tried to open...

640
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:10,500
...this door that has been closed for so long.

641
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:14,210
But every one of them failed

642
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:18,180
and it was said that they had committed strange suicides,

643
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,789
they fell into a coma or died in accidents.

644
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:23,920
So people call it the curse of room 402.

645
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:29,360
We have seen with our own eyes that it does not open.

646
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,780
No, I can't open it.

647
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,150
Did everyone see it?

648
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:49,619
The door is closed like a solid rock.

649
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,719
But! Later,

650
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:56,520
we will be the first to open and film inside room 402.

651
00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:02,730
We will get to the bottom of the mystery of this room.

652
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,230
Agreed, great!

653
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:12,610
55,000 views.

654
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:22,319
GROUP CARE ROOM 1st FLOOR

655
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:27,319
HALLWAY, 2ND FLOOR

656
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:31,829
SUPPLY ROOM 3RD FLOOR

657
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:36,329
SHOWER ROOM 3RD FLOOR

658
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:40,830
BATHROOM 3RD FLOOR

659
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:45,340
ROOM 402

660
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:48,909
You'll wait here until I finish filming the intro...

661
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:51,410
...and you will follow me as I walk the room.

662
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:54,149
Be sure to film their positions...

663
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:56,250
...at any time during the ritual.

664
00:41:56,252 --> 00:41:56,978
OK.

665
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:59,620
Let's start the ritual.

666
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:03,120
The music is... on.

667
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,590
Seung-wook, your turn.

668
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:43,000
Now I am in the director's room, the place for our medium ritual.

669
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,400
Can you see this?

670
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:52,740
The red ropes attached with small bells hang like a spider web.

671
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:01,649
The amulet, millet and cinnabar...

672
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:05,990
...are prepared at the table for the ritual.

673
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,859
Now!

674
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:12,730
We will perform the dangerous ritual of calling the ghosts.

675
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:17,230
I'd be leaving this room right now if it wasn't for the live feed.

676
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:20,030
I am very scared and nervous, but!

677
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:24,840
We will keep our promise to broadcast this ritual live.

678
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:29,740
Ah-yeon, the youngest member, will perform the ritual.

679
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,110
Ah-yeon, let's get started.

680
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:44,660
She will light the incense...

681
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:00,670
...and burn the amulet...

682
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,250
...full of spells calling bewitched spirits.

683
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:10,580
A monk from Bomoon Temple generously offered us the amulet.

684
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:19,830
Get up and say hello.

685
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:32,240
Now we will sit and wait and see...

686
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:34,100
...what's going on...

687
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,910
The candlelight flickers.

688
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,150
What is it?

689
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:20,150
God!

690
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:28,650
What the hell?

691
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,360
What is it?

692
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:34,490
- Damn! - What the hell is that?

693
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,930
That? That? What is happening?

694
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:45,070
Where to!

695
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,409
Jesus Christ...

696
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:56,650
Did you see the camera turn?

697
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:58,580
It is not a joke!

698
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:00,450
All the rumors were true!

699
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:02,360
Did everyone film?

700
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:03,860
I totally missed it.

701
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,790
This place is on another level.

702
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:08,899
Do not scare me.

703
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,330
Comment Seung-wook!

704
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:12,770
Put everyone in the frame, Sung-hun.

705
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:16,570
Get ready, let's go!

706
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:20,670
Did everyone see that? I still can't believe what I've seen.

707
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:24,569
The place is closed from the outside.

708
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:26,879
But shortly after the ritual they began...

709
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,980
...to move the sail, the bells and the camera.

710
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:34,180
As if anyone wasn't happy with our challenge.

711
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:37,520
But we promise you that we will finish our mission...

712
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:40,520
...regardless of the risk that lies ahead.

713
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,860
Do not go anywhere.

714
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:44,290
OK!

715
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:47,590
Move to the next place. I'll broadcast the replay.

716
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:52,750
She will light the incense...

717
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,590
- Yes captain. - They didn't notice, did they?

718
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,360
No, they really freaked out.

719
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:18,160
Did it seem real?

720
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:20,800
Clear. This rocked!

721
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,470
What is the number now?

722
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,520
100,000 views!

723
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:26,520
- 100,000, really? - Incredible!

724
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:29,660
We're off to a good start

725
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:32,630
so we have to do it right to reach a million views.

726
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:36,100
Recheck the settings and direct their reactions.

727
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,200
I have it!

728
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:40,430
I think Charlotte's reactions are killing this.

729
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:42,770
I'll try to push her further.

730
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:45,840
Good. Make sure they don't find out.

731
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:49,210
Even a ghost can't. I have to go.

732
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:11,600
Shit.

733
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:18,340
What the hell!

734
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:25,680
Are you kidding?

735
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:33,920
That...

736
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:37,920
Come on.

737
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:44,530
Perfect. A good moment.

738
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,190
And now that?

739
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:42,090
So now we're in the lab...

740
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:44,690
...on the first floor after the ritual.

741
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:48,929
We're a little calmer, but like all of you online,

742
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:53,930
we still don't know how to explain what just happened.

743
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:58,800
Anyway, we'll stick with our plan and head to the lab.

744
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:22,190
The whole room smells weird.

745
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,430
- Is this the lab? - It's further in.

746
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,340
Isn't that great?

747
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:39,210
This is the inside of the laboratory.

748
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:43,350
That's the stench.

749
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:45,650
I broke a glass bottle earlier.

750
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:49,020
On the ground, to the left. You can see it?

751
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,820
Kind of like a dead chicken. That's what sucks.

752
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:56,930
Wait. Why is there a doll in the laboratory room?

753
00:50:58,630 --> 00:50:59,730
Are you kidding?

754
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:04,070
It wasn't there before. Right Ji-hyun?

755
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:07,670
It was in the closet, not there.

756
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:08,640
That?

757
00:51:08,641 --> 00:51:10,539
The doll was in the closet!

758
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:12,950
Approach the doll.

759
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:21,550
It looks like the doll in the photo. A patient was holding him.

760
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:25,500
No way.

761
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:27,989
Is there anyone else here?

762
00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:30,030
What are you doing?

763
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:32,429
What are you doing? Do not touch it.

764
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:34,829
No! Do not touch it! Put it back in its place!

765
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:36,999
Down it! Lee Seung-wook!

766
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,199
Hey, put it down already!

767
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,069
Right now! Down it!

768
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:41,670
- Seung-wook. - Film this, quick!

769
00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:44,370
Can't you just put it down?

770
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:47,180
¡Charlotte!

771
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,910
Je-yoon, siguela.

772
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,020
Captain, look at this!

773
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:00,840
Yes. It's the same doll.

774
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:04,440
The captain said it's the same. Why is he touching it?

775
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:06,440
Charlotte, calm down.

776
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:08,449
You can't touch random things in places like this.

777
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:09,949
Ji-hyun! You saw it too.

778
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:12,380
The doll was in the closet!

779
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:13,520
Are we the only ones here?

780
00:52:13,521 --> 00:52:16,320
I'll put the photo on the screen, your comment, Seung Wook.

781
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:19,320
Get ready, let's go!

782
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,660
See this doll I'm holding?

783
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:26,070
Do not get surprised.

784
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:29,940
This doll that Charlotte claims was in the closet...

785
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:34,240
...it's the doll in the photo in the principal's room...

786
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:37,610
...where we perform the ritual.

787
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:40,360
Please compare them.

788
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:45,850
Why has this doll appeared...

789
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:48,820
...and has moved alone?

790
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:53,840
Is there really a supernatural energy in this place?

791
00:52:54,970 --> 00:52:58,970
Strange things keep happening here. Everything is real...

792
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:02,570
...and you're watching it live!

793
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,600
Ok, we'll be back soon...

794
00:53:14,010 --> 00:53:16,310
They are fucking actors!

795
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:21,820
I can't stay here. I want to leave.

796
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:23,690
Charlotte, how can we leave?

797
00:53:28,090 --> 00:53:30,330
This is very extrange.

798
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:34,630
- We can't leave. - Yes, Charlotte.

799
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,740
Stop filming, Ah-yeon.

800
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:41,340
- I'm sorry, Charlotte. - You too, stop filming!

801
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:44,310
¡Lee Seung-wook!

802
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,140
You never touch things in places like this!

803
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:47,650
They are cursed!

804
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:50,320
You can be in serious trouble!

805
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:51,180
I'm sorry.

806
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:55,150
I just wanted to check it out as I couldn't believe my eyes.

807
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,520
Damn...

808
00:53:56,990 --> 00:53:58,319
We should give it some time...

809
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,229
It is more dangerous to be alone.

810
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:02,429
Let's wrap up and get the hell out of here, okay?

811
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:04,000
Do you all hear me?

812
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:09,600
If you all want to resign here, I'll make your decision.

813
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:14,310
Then everything we've done so far would come to nothing.

814
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:16,810
Let's hold out a bit, okay?

815
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:22,310
Let's wrap this up as safely as possible, just like Charlotte said.

816
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:27,450
Yeah, we're here together, so let's end this together.

817
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,390
Okay then.

818
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:34,390
Hey, never do anything risky!

819
00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:36,590
Yes ma'am. I won't touch anything!

820
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,230
Very sorry.

821
00:54:37,231 --> 00:54:40,229
- Never! I'm serious. - Okay, I get it.

822
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:41,729
It's a pause.

823
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:43,740
Go to the next point and get ready.

824
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,810
Je-yoon and Ah-yeon go to the fourth floor.

825
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,439
They will be on the air soon.

826
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,439
Install infrared flashes on the ceiling.

827
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,579
Yes captain.

828
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:53,680
Can we take a minute?

829
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:57,220
When you're done on the 1st floor, go to the 3rd and 4th floors.

830
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:59,680
Seung-wook and Sung-hun, let me know when you're ready.

831
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:00,720
- Alright. - Clear.

832
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:03,050
Can we take a minute? Please?

833
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:06,320
- Don't do that again, never again! - I understand!

834
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:09,390
- You do not hear me? - Let's move!

835
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:15,570
Are you okay Charlotte?

836
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,570
- Yes let's go.

837
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:22,610
get ready and...

838
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:23,740
Come on!

839
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:36,650
This is the group care room.

840
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:38,990
Take a look inside.

841
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:42,190
The roof has fallen...

842
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:45,800
...and small wooden cabinets surround the walls.

843
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:49,200
It looks like a catacomb...

844
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:52,370
...bombed during the war.

845
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,840
Patients received so-called "treatments"...

846
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:01,810
...in these small wooden cabinets.

847
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:04,050
Very spooky.

848
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:11,190
Well, I'll look at this cabinet with a door.

849
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:17,160
Strangely, there is a hole at chest level, not in the face.

850
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,100
What was that hole for?

851
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:21,570
Not for surveillance. I guess.

852
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:23,740
Let me open the door.

853
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:26,740
There is no knob.

854
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:32,940
That? What's going on?

855
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:34,550
- Shit. - That?

856
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:36,310
That?

857
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,379
- Someone pulled my arm. - That?

858
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:40,819
Stop playing, I warned you.

859
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:42,520
I'm not kidding!

860
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:45,360
I told you! This place is cursed!

861
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,329
Seung-wook, put out your hand.

862
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:48,589
Sung-hun, move the camera closer.

863
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:50,530
Seung-wook, your line.

864
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:56,030
Someone tugged at my arm inside that door.

865
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:00,170
I can't say exactly because it happened too fast.

866
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:03,110
So I'll put my arm there again.

867
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:06,110
- You're crazy? - Do not do it!

868
00:57:06,810 --> 00:57:08,350
Deténganlo!

869
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:11,180
- Do not do it! Please do not do it! - Why not?

870
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,120
Let me do it!

871
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:14,720
Hey no!

872
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:18,860
- It's too dangerous! - Stop her right now! Fast!

873
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:22,830
Okay, okay. I understand!

874
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:24,500
Take this.

875
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:25,730
No!

876
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:32,430
Nothing...

877
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:35,200
¡ Ji-hyun! Ji-hyun!

878
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:37,210
- What is happening? - Captain!

879
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:39,870
- What is this? - Do something! Ji-hyun!

880
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:51,650
Ji-hyun your arm...

881
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:44,570
They yell like they're on the pirate ship.

882
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:53,380
- I hear the ping pong ball! - Takes out the EMF.

883
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:07,090
It was written "We are going to live", but it was changed to "We are going to die!"

884
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,300
Are you sure?

885
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:11,599
This place is cursed.

886
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:14,969
We have to go... or we're all going to die.

887
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:16,969
Let's go Charlotte. I can't be here any longer.

888
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:19,239
- What are you doing? - Let's go.

889
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:22,180
- Hey, Ji-hyun. - Look at this.

890
00:59:22,610 --> 00:59:24,780
We will never know what will come next.

891
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:27,420
we are cursed What should I do?

892
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:31,620
- Hey... - Get away, will you?

893
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:33,619
Captain! Do you hear us?

894
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:36,590
- Calm down. - You saw it too!

895
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:40,459
You saw what happened in the medium ritual.

896
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:42,960
He even pulled my scarf.

897
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:46,960
And he also took your arm like he did mine.

898
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:49,170
And the letters on the wall changed!

899
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,870
Listen, Ji-hyun... the truth is... in the ritual...

900
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:54,869
Hey! We are also afraid. We're scared, but...

901
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:57,380
we're on board together, so let's finish and go together.

902
00:59:57,410 --> 00:59:59,710
Not even the captain knows what to say!

903
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:03,450
If something happens, who will take care of it?

904
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:08,250
Move on! We are leaving. Let's go.

905
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:35,010
Be careful Charlotte.

906
01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:54,430
I can see someone wrote. "Let's live."

907
01:00:58,340 --> 01:00:59,340
Hey friend!

908
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:01,450
Friend!

909
01:01:01,810 --> 01:01:02,870
Ha-joon!

910
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:04,220
Say something!

911
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:07,849
Yes Seung-wook.

912
01:01:07,850 --> 01:01:09,680
Because you say nothing!

913
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:11,850
The connection is bad.

914
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,280
Ji-hyun and Charlotte left.

915
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:14,890
I know. I saw it.

916
01:01:15,390 --> 01:01:16,950
I checked the letters on the wall.

917
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,260
They changed it?

918
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,660
Are you kidding? No way.

919
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:23,060
It was "let's die" from the beginning.

920
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,829
I am speechless.

921
01:01:25,830 --> 01:01:27,200
So what happens to them?

922
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:29,700
Don't know. Don't know. They're just scared.

923
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:33,440
Charlotte was already terrified ever since you touched the doll in the lab.

924
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:35,309
But you just saw it too.

925
01:01:35,310 --> 01:01:38,009
They grabbed Ji-hyun's arm and Charlotte's scarf as well.

926
01:01:38,010 --> 01:01:40,880
It seemed that Ji-hyun was faking it.

927
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:44,010
He seemed to have discovered our show.

928
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:45,950
Why the hell would she fake it?

929
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:48,450
How should I know? Maybe she just wanted to leave?

930
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:50,750
- So, the scratch on his arm? - Good.

931
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,460
There could be thorns inside.

932
01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:53,660
What about Charlotte?

933
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:57,370
I saw her scarf with my own eyes! I filmed it too!

934
01:01:57,470 --> 01:02:00,930
That's what seems strange to me too, so I keep going through the video.

935
01:02:01,170 --> 01:02:03,299
Was there wind blowing?

936
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:07,170
It's fucking closed! How can the wind blow?

937
01:02:07,770 --> 01:02:10,900
There has to be something. Very strange. Let's stop here.

938
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:13,100
Do you think you can quit like that?

939
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:20,020
Listen carefully. We have to finish this.

940
01:02:20,890 --> 01:02:22,419
Do you know how many views are now?

941
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:26,060
Over 300,000! What if we stop now?

942
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:28,929
No announcements for interrupted broadcasts!

943
01:02:28,930 --> 01:02:30,010
Let's try some more.

944
01:02:30,650 --> 01:02:33,010
A brief tour of the 3rd floor, we open room 402,

945
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:33,810
and that's it.

946
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:35,140
What if something happens?

947
01:02:35,310 --> 01:02:37,810
I'll buy some time by placing a short repetition...

948
01:02:37,910 --> 01:02:39,340
- Let's live again... - To hell with that.

949
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:43,350
Seung-wook...¡Lee Seung-wook!

950
01:02:44,450 --> 01:02:45,450
Came back!

951
01:02:46,090 --> 01:02:47,090
Hey you!

952
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:48,770
Damn!

953
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,550
I shouldn't have signed on the wall.

954
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:53,320
I am cursed and could die.

955
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:56,060
That's why we left. We should be fine.

956
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:01,730
- You saw it too. - Charlotte!

957
01:03:01,870 --> 01:03:04,570
- Under my name, it was written... - I said we'd be fine!

958
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:07,810
What should I do?

959
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:08,840
Get up!

960
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:12,150
Get up!

961
01:03:13,510 --> 01:03:14,750
Charlotte.

962
01:03:15,310 --> 01:03:17,350
We will return to the camp now...

963
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:19,620
...and we'll go home in the morning.

964
01:03:21,050 --> 01:03:23,550
Let's go home.

965
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:25,720
We can go home.

966
01:03:27,730 --> 01:03:29,590
Let's go home.

967
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:31,360
We can go home.

968
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:37,300
You see it?

969
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:41,240
The scarf stands up on its own. It's not the wind.

970
01:03:43,010 --> 01:03:46,940
Let's get out of here with Je-yoon and Ah-yeon.

971
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:49,380
- Friend. - Yeah.

972
01:03:49,810 --> 01:03:51,620
Hey, let's make a deal.

973
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:53,149
That?

974
01:03:53,150 --> 01:03:56,690
If we end up here everything becomes useless.

975
01:03:57,020 --> 01:04:00,520
300,000 views can generate $150,000 in ads.

976
01:04:00,530 --> 01:04:04,029
Let's ask for 20% more, we can get at least $40,000 each.

977
01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:05,360
Continue with this?

978
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,970
As if someone was not happy...

979
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:20,110
Ji-hyun...

980
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:21,949
Je-yoon,

981
01:04:21,950 --> 01:04:23,449
Seung-wook and Ah-yeon...

982
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:26,150
Charlotte and Sung-hoon, all six of them are there.

983
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:28,890
Who the hell filmed this then?

984
01:04:33,730 --> 01:04:35,390
What the hell! No!

985
01:04:36,430 --> 01:04:37,390
No, don't do this to me!

986
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:38,100
No!

987
01:04:38,101 --> 01:04:39,400
No way!

988
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:42,590
Damn!

989
01:04:52,910 --> 01:04:55,449
As if anyone isn't happy...

990
01:04:55,450 --> 01:04:56,510
Ha-joon.

991
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:00,720
Yeah.

992
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:02,520
We have some conditions.

993
01:05:02,950 --> 01:05:04,050
What conditions?

994
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:07,160
You increase our profits by 20% each. So we're in.

995
01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:09,390
And for the others too.

996
01:05:14,370 --> 01:05:16,220
What are you saying? Yes or no?

997
01:05:21,110 --> 01:05:23,530
Okay, 20% more for you and everyone else too.

998
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:27,420
We'll be back live when the replay is over.

999
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:28,810
Hurry to the third floor.

1000
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:31,110
Don't ever turn off the radio again.

1001
01:05:32,350 --> 01:05:33,720
Or I will kill you.

1002
01:05:39,490 --> 01:05:41,190
Was it that far?

1003
01:05:42,810 --> 01:05:44,550
It's taking too long.

1004
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:46,800
Check it out!

1005
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:48,729
We are on the good way.

1006
01:05:48,730 --> 01:05:50,630
We put it there on the way.

1007
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:53,900
We are almost there.

1008
01:05:54,670 --> 01:05:57,170
We are almost there. Let's go.

1009
01:06:07,890 --> 01:06:10,490
SHOWER ROOM

1010
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:13,120
What you see is the shower room...

1011
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:18,330
...one of the two scariest places along with the corridor on the fourth floor...

1012
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,470
...of this asylum.

1013
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:24,480
Looking up,

1014
01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:28,020
you can see the following cameras.

1015
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:33,260
But no particular signs so far.

1016
01:06:37,230 --> 01:06:38,630
What is that sound?

1017
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:41,200
Does it come from the supply room?

1018
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,770
Get out of the shower room, move to the supply room!

1019
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:49,770
Both of you, quick!

1020
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:11,630
Seung-wook, your line.

1021
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,830
We just heard a strange sound coming from here,

1022
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,500
from the supply room.

1023
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:24,670
You must have heard it too.

1024
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:28,209
A loud sound of something...

1025
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:30,980
...slamming into the wall.

1026
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:35,120
What was that noise?

1027
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,560
Sung-hoon, go behind that closet and film!

1028
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:51,740
Seung-wook, say something first!

1029
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:53,670
Friend!

1030
01:07:53,990 --> 01:07:55,790
Things!

1031
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:01,650
Did everyone see that?

1032
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:07,770
What if there is...

1033
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:14,360
...a supernatural energy...

1034
01:08:21,070 --> 01:08:25,500
¡Sung-hun!

1035
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:56,070
¡Seung-wook!

1036
01:08:56,570 --> 01:08:58,370
¡Lee Seung-wook!

1037
01:09:03,010 --> 01:09:04,110
Hey!

1038
01:09:04,210 --> 01:09:05,240
Wake up!

1039
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:09,650
Seung-wook, please!

1040
01:09:36,310 --> 01:09:36,710
That?

1041
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,170
As...

1042
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:45,480
How is it possible?

1043
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:52,290
We already went there.

1044
01:09:55,590 --> 01:09:57,990
This place is also weird. Ji-hyun...

1045
01:09:58,560 --> 01:09:59,730
Wait.

1046
01:10:02,130 --> 01:10:03,900
What is that smell?

1047
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,200
That?

1048
01:10:11,010 --> 01:10:12,980
Why is that here?

1049
01:10:17,190 --> 01:10:20,420
These were in the lab!

1050
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:24,480
¡ Ji-hyun!

1051
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:29,360
Ji-hyun...

1052
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:34,230
What is happening to you?

1053
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:38,400
¡ Ji-hyun!

1054
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:44,220
Ji-hyun...

1055
01:10:58,990 --> 01:11:00,190
No do not do that!

1056
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:02,260
Ji-hyun...

1057
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:03,460
My God...

1058
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:59,500
Captain! Captain...

1059
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:02,320
Where are you?

1060
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:31,580
Ji-hyun...

1061
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:47,320
Please help me...

1062
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:52,770
Soulmate...

1063
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:01,500
No! Help me! Please!

1064
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:03,230
Please let me out!

1065
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:05,900
Open the door!

1066
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:25,520
Sung-hun...

1067
01:16:27,030 --> 01:16:28,730
We have to go right now!

1068
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,730
Let's go now! Fast!

1069
01:16:30,930 --> 01:16:32,060
The door is almost open!

1070
01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:33,429
It does not matter.

1071
01:16:33,430 --> 01:16:35,300
We shouldn't be here. We have to go!

1072
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:37,539
Because?

1073
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:40,939
Seung-wook is locked in the room below.

1074
01:16:40,940 --> 01:16:44,040
Fuck that bastard! We are about to reach one million!

1075
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:45,710
What are you talking about?

1076
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:47,309
We shouldn't be here.

1077
01:16:47,310 --> 01:16:50,080
We have to save Seung-wook and get out of this place!

1078
01:16:51,350 --> 01:16:52,850
- Yes captain. - Ah-yeon.

1079
01:16:52,990 --> 01:16:54,450
Open the door and come in now.

1080
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:57,790
The captain told me to open the door and come in now.

1081
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:00,560
Both of you, listen to me.

1082
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:04,500
The ritual and the doll we assemble it.

1083
01:17:04,630 --> 01:17:05,630
That?

1084
01:17:05,631 --> 01:17:07,229
We faked it for the views!

1085
01:17:07,230 --> 01:17:09,800
But everything that is happening right now is real!

1086
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:13,110
That fucking idiot...

1087
01:17:13,190 --> 01:17:16,340
Seung-wook could die. We have to save him now!

1088
01:17:16,510 --> 01:17:17,440
This is real?

1089
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:20,310
I'm serious! We're all going to die if we stay!

1090
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:34,030
If you don't do it, I'll do it myself.

1091
01:17:35,830 --> 01:17:37,560
The ping-pong ball again!

1092
01:17:47,210 --> 01:17:49,110
Shit! What the hell is that?

1093
01:17:55,930 --> 01:17:57,020
That...

1094
01:18:01,190 --> 01:18:02,690
Is there someone inside?

1095
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:04,789
What is happening?

1096
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:06,530
Everything is real.

1097
01:18:07,530 --> 01:18:08,590
Please help me!

1098
01:18:09,230 --> 01:18:10,230
¡Sálvenme!

1099
01:18:11,630 --> 01:18:12,630
¿Charlotte?

1100
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:13,730
It's you?

1101
01:18:13,731 --> 01:18:16,999
- I can not open the door! - Let me do it. Charlotte!

1102
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,300
- Charlotte! - Do something! Charlotte!

1103
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:23,210
What are we going to do?

1104
01:18:27,150 --> 01:18:29,310
- ¡Charlotte!
- ¡Charlotte!

1105
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:32,880
¡Sung-hun!

1106
01:18:32,890 --> 01:18:34,950
- Hey... - Where are you going?

1107
01:18:35,890 --> 01:18:39,190
¡Sung-hun! ¡Sung-hun!

1108
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:46,400
Je-yoon...

1109
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:57,310
- ¡Sung-hun! - ¡Sung-hun!

1110
01:18:58,980 --> 01:19:00,480
What is happening?

1111
01:19:42,290 --> 01:19:44,360
What the fuck is this?

1112
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:04,310
- Ah-yeon... - I'm here.

1113
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:06,980
Where is Sung-hun?

1114
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:09,480
Do not move.

1115
01:20:12,990 --> 01:20:14,390
What is under our feet?

1116
01:20:15,050 --> 01:20:16,460
It feels like water.

1117
01:20:21,430 --> 01:20:22,830
Do you have the light?

1118
01:20:27,850 --> 01:20:29,470
What's wrong with that?

1119
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:33,510
- Because it does not work? - Shit.

1120
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:39,640
Why is there echo here?

1121
01:20:46,220 --> 01:20:47,520
I guess we're...

1122
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:52,960
- ...in room 402. - What?

1123
01:20:55,130 --> 01:20:56,830
You have the camcorder, right?

1124
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:00,100
Give me that.

1125
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:07,040
That?

1126
01:21:07,870 --> 01:21:09,340
Where we are?

1127
01:21:16,820 --> 01:21:19,050
There is no door here.

1128
01:21:23,790 --> 01:21:25,190
Why is there no door?

1129
01:21:35,570 --> 01:21:36,840
Water?

1130
01:21:39,670 --> 01:21:41,510
How is it possible?

1131
01:21:53,850 --> 01:21:55,390
What is happening?

1132
01:21:59,790 --> 01:22:00,890
Is there someone.

1133
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,060
Where?

1134
01:22:04,130 --> 01:22:06,129
- A girl... - No way.

1135
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:07,630
He's watching us.

1136
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Are we really in room 402?

1137
01:22:13,670 --> 01:22:14,810
Je-yoon...

1138
01:22:15,010 --> 01:22:16,640
In your face! Hands!

1139
01:22:20,290 --> 01:22:22,690
You too, Ah-yeon...

1140
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:24,860
Do not do that...

1141
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:30,500
Anyone here...

1142
01:22:38,610 --> 01:22:40,380
We have to get out of here.

1143
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:04,130
Ah-yeon... ¡Ah-yeon!

1144
01:26:04,980 --> 01:26:06,180
Sung-hun...

1145
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:11,290
Ah-yeon...

1146
01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:14,820
¡Je-yoon!

1147
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:38,330
¡Sung-hun!

1148
01:28:39,590 --> 01:28:40,590
¡Je-yoon!

1149
01:28:42,170 --> 01:28:43,740
Can you hear me?

1150
01:28:44,540 --> 01:28:47,610
Please help! Where are you?

1151
01:28:49,910 --> 01:28:51,680
Help me please!

1152
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:03,459
Save me! Sung-hun!

1153
01:29:03,460 --> 01:29:06,230
Please come help me!

1154
01:29:06,650 --> 01:29:08,720
Anyone here?

1155
01:29:34,610 --> 01:29:36,680
Isn't it a live stream?

1156
01:29:36,820 --> 01:29:39,249
It was cut after it turned out to be a fake show.

1157
01:29:39,250 --> 01:29:42,390
He knew they would manipulate him.
