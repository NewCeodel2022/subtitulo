the last episode of all.

That was a plate from Louis XIV's era.

00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,740
The viewers don't think it's a CG.

36
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,650
Our show is all about CG, though.

I agree!

45
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,670
"Made in Heaven" refers to Grim Reaper's

47

[Lee El's face 3D model]

677
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:17,830
We'd put on her wig. It's a very difficult work. For four or five hours...

678
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:20,070
She has to sit still like that.

679
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:22,370

683
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,680
- there's their know-how.
- You're going through a lot.

684
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:51,080
People who glued on and worked on my face suffered a lot more.

685
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,870
When I was in pain, I'd express all that and...

686
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:58,190
When I was uncomfortable, I spoke up quite a bit...

687
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:01,150
I'm sure it was hard for them.

688
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:03,900

- Wearing... wearing this?
- I think the director is a bit stunned.

692
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,600
I told you earlier that I'm wearing burgundy top and bottom.

693
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,670
- Burgundy? If you say that, how would I know such a difficult word?
- Plum color.

694
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:23,220
I usually don't dress so particularly while working on dramas...

695
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:27,490
But while working on Goblin, I want to have fun dressing like this.

696
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:30,620
- Just don't use difficult words.
- I got it.

697
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:34,760
- Say reddish color, not burgundy.
- Dark color.
[Goblin convinces the director who was shocked at his full burgundy fashion]

I heard the elementary kids are going to school wearing that hat.

Wow, that hat was made with really great fabric.
[Made in heaven. Watch out for fake merchandise~]

When we decided on the brooch in the beginning...

731
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:31,610
The director was wondering if it was a flat out too much of a spoiler. But we pushed forward.

732

[Of course, for Eun Tak, it stole hearts of the viewers as well]

739
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,260
I asked as if I was doing everything myself.
[Who did the Goblin ask to decorate the interior?]

740

If you were to ask me about expensive props, they'd be furniture usually. [Joo Dong Man, Props Team Leader]

741

They were antique furniture. So, the most expensive props were furniture.
[The Goblin House was decorated with unique and charming antique furniture]

742
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,890
Besides that... the sword that was produced just for Goblin?

743
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:39,180
The sword was especially produced for this project. So, you can say that we put in some expenses to produce that sword.

744
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,550
Wow, you're cool!

[Is this okay? Dishes are breaking nonstop!]

752

It had to go outside like that, but the director kept making NGs...

I have not lived through the times of Louis XIV. I went through Namdaemun market...

754
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:24,750
I bought something similar... looking antique... I bought cheap ones and we broke them.

755

[You're watching the scene that came about after numerous "made in Namdaemun" dishes were broken]

[Buckwheat flowers bloom in late summer]

Among them, as for buckwheat flowers, we filmed the first portion in the summer.

761
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:56,910
We filmed the second half after we got back from Canada. So there weren't any buckwheat flowers around.

762
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:59,000
- Buckwheat flower scent.
- Buckwheat flower bouquet please!
[Beginning of taping, Summer! Goblin was taped at the buckwheat field filled with flower scent]

766
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,060
Buckwheat flowers.

767
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:13,530
That's-That's not what I'm asking.

768
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:15,530
Why are you holding them?

769
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:20,280
My mother grew them in the house for a month.

770
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,600
It's my first time hearing that. Really, it's my first time. Really.

771
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:28,520
She brought them to us at the Jumunjin location. Thanks to her, we were able to finish recording.

[Picturesque first meeting of Goblin and Eun Tak completed!]

776

This scene was left out, but there's a lamp in the Grim Reaper's cafe.

777
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:49,900
- The one hanging off the ceiling in the middle.
- Ah, yes.
[This light fixture came from New York across the ocean]

778

The director and art director bought it from New York.

779
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:54,710
Actually, lots of props in the Grim Reaper's cafe are from New York.

780
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:58,550
- How about the chime? The one hanging.
- Yes, that was bought in New York, too.

781
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:04,730
That light fixture was very expensive also. So, we were very careful...

782
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:06,420
whenever we had to record.

783

It's moving. It's moving...

797
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:56,680
The makeup team and props team worked together to create it.

798
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:01,780
We made a cast that matches Gong Yoo's body and put on the thick and hard...

799
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:03,960
It's thick, but we made it light.

800
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:08,100
So, we made an incision with the drill in the chest area and put the sword in it.

801
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:12,060
I've done exactly the same thing in my previous project.

802
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,930
I had to portray a role where the sword comes out of my body.

803
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:20,000
I put on that cast and had about 30 swords stuck on it. That's very complicated and it takes a long time.

Actually, the fire on the Goblin sword is more green than blue.

811
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:53,160
Red looks too strong and too intense. And blue looks too cold.

812

813

[Actors passionately acting in the perfectly good car]

[The car is prepared in advance for the filming]

828
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:10,490
[The car is split in half?]

829
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:13,040
They prepared two of the same car.

830
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,080
One car is fine and the other one is...

831
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,250
already cut in half...

832
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:19,850
Wow, amazing.

833
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:22,740
They cut it so much better than I had expected. I was so surprised.

834
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:27,710
And with CG, we added fire or sparks in other areas...

835
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:33,240
We made it seem as though it was just cut. We made it very realistic.

836
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:36,270
[Staff members are pulling the car using a rope]

837
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:39,890
Since the car that's cut up can't move by itself...

838
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:43,970
You can't drive it, so they put the training wheels on and pulled it by hand...

839
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:45,330
Like that...
[Back to where they started manually]

840
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:48,100
Yeah...

841
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:53,790
[The scene where the car falls when the Grim Reaper leaning against it steps away from it]

842

843
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,260

844

00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:26,910
Save me!

849
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:28,250
It's too late.

850
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:32,870
[How did they make this scene?]

851
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:44,740
Wow, we finally have the scene with the ship. I thought this scene was so cool...
[Grim Reaper's voice gets louder when his favorite scene comes up]

852
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:46,620
I was so curious even before the episode aired.

853
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:51,190
Even from the highlight scene... it's one of my favorite scenes.

854
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:55,160
[This construction site is the Goblin location?]

855
00:49:56,810 --> 00:49:59,090
Is this the most steep angle for this scene?

856
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:00,520
[Inside a large water tank, the ship is almost standing up!]

857
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:07,290
People will fall in and when you hit it down with the sword, it will blow up...

858
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:09,290
[The preparation began in the day and the recording goes into the late night]

859
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:11,200
Wow, it's really gigantic.
[The preparation began in the day and the recording goes into the late night]

860
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,920
Yes, they made the ship.

861
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,890
Yes, I heard it was very expensive to make it.

862
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:21,160
Yes, from what I heard it cost enough to make an entire episode.

863
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:23,780
So many people worked so hard for this.
[Thanks to so many staff members' hard work, the spectacular scene came together]

864
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:26,940
Our stunt team and martial arts team really suffered.

865
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,090
[Recording in the large water tank]

866
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:35,230
[Combining the blue screen set to produce the sinking ship scene!]

867
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:39,420
[The filming where the combination of ship's movement, actors acting, and special effects are important]

868
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:44,840
The recording is divided into the time before the Goblin gets angry and after he gets angry.

869
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:50,910
So, before he gets angry, they built a ship model on the set

870
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:55,370
and that's how the recording proceeded. And after he gets angry, the ship starts to tilt.

871
00:50:55,370 --> 00:51:01,630
So, the part where the ship tilts, we actually tilted the ship at an angle in the water tank set and proceeded with the recording.

872
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:07,470
Besides the ship and characters, waves, backgrounds, and fire that catches on the body...

873
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:12,020
The fire on the sword and etc... we had to do all that in CG.
[Actual recording scene --> After applying CG]

874
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:15,050
It took a lot of time and concentrated efforts.

875
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:17,610
[About 20 people assigned to the Goblin project completed it after working on it for over 24 hours!]

876
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:22,900
[A great scene was created after the actual recording and CG!]

877
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,650
- Wow, isn't the scale grand?
- Wow!

878
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:31,530
So, it took about a week to record that. I'm so proud.

879
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,430
The viewers don't think it's CG when it comes to that.

880
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:36,500
They do think the ocean is CG.

881
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,550
But they ask how big is the set...

882
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:41,500
So, it's not fair for the CG team.

883
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,440
Our drama is a CG drama.

884
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,670
[Our CG team is the best!]

All I did was just put my spoon on a well prepared table.

987
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:41,690
Anyway, with so many things fitting in well...

988
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:44,290
I believe I was able to receive this award.

989
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:46,570
I think people who deserve the awards received them.

990
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:48,300
It was so fun. The names of the awards.

991
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:49,610
They were perfect.

992
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:52,070
Full of great content...

993
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:55,760
Goblin Recall Special part 2. With our last greeting...

994
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,730
I believe the drama will be safely recalled to the other world.

995
00:58:59,730 --> 00:59:03,020
I'm so sad and regretful to hear you say "our last."

996
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:04,750
Isn't there season 2 or something?

997
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:07,480
Season 2? I'm not sure. Well, who knows?

998
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,820
No one knows what will happen.

999
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:15,320
Please don't forget our drama and keep it in your hearts for a very long time.

1000
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:19,980
Thank you so much for your love. We'll say our goodbyes now.

1001
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:21,910
Everyone, goodbye!

1002
00:59:21,910 --> 00:59:23,290
Bye!

1003
00:59:23,290 --> 00:59:24,620
Thank you!

1004
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:27,620
♬ You’re everywhere even if I close my eyes ♬

1005
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:31,210
Okay, you worked hard!

1006
00:59:31,210 --> 00:59:34,980
Fun drama, Goblin... thank you for your love.

1007
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:38,480
Thank you for taking care of us.

1008
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:42,620
It would be nice to visit you again as a different character and appearance.

1009
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:45,660
All the days spent with you were good.

1010
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:50,790
Every moment I was acting, I was so happy. It was the best.

1011
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:55,350
It will probably be the character and drama I will never forget for the rest of my life.

1012
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:58,850
That's how much I love this project.

1013
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:02,480
Everyone, please don't forget Goblin too fast.

1014
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:06,150
Lonely yet brillant...

1015
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:09,180
Strange yet beautiful. It was like that.

1016
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:12,590
I will do my best to show you good work in the future.

1017
01:00:12,590 --> 01:00:14,680
Thank you.

1018
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:16,680
Bye.

1019
01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:18,410
One, two, three!
[ Wating for those who will stay by our side once again ]

1020
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:22,370
[ We were happy. Our brilliant Goblin ]

1021
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:24,570
Today... what? What?

1022
01:00:24,570 --> 01:00:29,260
I want to, wanna, wanna, wanna... have her leave...

1023
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:35,380
Goblin underwear... Strong and...

1024
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:38,530
Thank you. Be nice.

1025
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:42,560
Wait.

1026
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:46,240
On this side, a pastel tone fireplace... fire...

1027
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,290
What we saw before...

1028
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:02,190
Do it again.

1029
