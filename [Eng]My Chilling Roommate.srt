Why am I late? It's still 30
minutes before the opening time.

If you come later than
me, then you are late.

17
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:28,640
Also, you are a part-timer. Don't you think you
should come in an hour before the cafe opens?

Isn't that abusing power as an employer?

Yes. It's always the same.

It's a real problem. That's why I said
you should stay with me at my house.

00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:48,439
Don't you think it's a shame
for me to die like this?

164
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,620
Well, sure.

165
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:53,050
What should I do?

166
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,679
What can I do to make other people see me?

167
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,229
Well, I got to go.

168
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,659
How can you just leave?
Tell me what I should do!

169
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,240
- Let me go.
- It's a shame for me to die like this, isn't it?

170
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:07,079
What should I do? Tell me something!

171
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,010
It hurts!

172
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,910
I'm sorry.

173
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:23,420
Let's talk again tomorrow.
I have to close the cafe.

174
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,929
What's wrong with you?

175
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:40,590
How can you follow me all the way here?

176
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:43,159
Why are you saying it like that?

177
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:47,070
I'm not trying to do anything to you,
but you are the only one I can talk to.

178
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,089
That's your problem.

179
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:52,609
If you are here, what am I supposed to do?

180
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:56,200
You? Just do what you normally do.

181
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,409
I'll just stay here quietly.

182
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:02,329
I'm not talking about that.

183
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:06,670
It's like talking to a wall. I'll
just stay here for the time being!

184
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,880
For the time being? Why are
you deciding that on your own?

185
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:13,599
What? Why are you suddenly
talking informally to me?

186
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,699
You've been talking informally to me from the
beginning. You were rude from the start.

187
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,130
You have zero manners.

188
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,360
We really don't see things eye to eye.

189
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,080
- What I'm saying is...
- Whatever. Just get out of here!

190
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,929
Get out of my house!

191
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,769
- Wait, one second...
- I said, get out!

192
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,509
Wait for a second!

193
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:36,280
Listen, I have no place to go!

194
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,979
What did you just say?

195
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,169
I said...

196
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:49,060
I have no place to go.

197
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,140
[Secretary]

198
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,899
Yes, what is it?

199
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:28,330
Managing Director, the thing is...

200
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:34,480
I get it. Please continue
to report it to me.

201
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:44,680
Ji Chan... Where are you?

202
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:49,729
Anyway, it's not okay.

203
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:54,300
Why not? Also, you said I'm a ghost.

204
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,020
Then, isn't it up to me?

205
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,199
I think you don't understand it. I'm...

206
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,179
Anyway, I'm not going anywhere.

207
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:05,349
I don't have a place to go or home.

208
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:08,690
- On top of that...
- On top of that, what?

209
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,700
I don't remember anything.

210
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,360
What?

211
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,819
I'm saying I don't remember anything.

212
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:25,629
Why I was there, or who I was.

213
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,869
I can't remember it.

214
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,799
This is driving me crazy.

215
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,339
You're lying to me right now, aren't you?

216
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,880
It's driving me crazy, too!

217
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:40,950
So let me stay here for a while.

218
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,150
Also, don't worry!

219
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:49,889
You are totally not my type.

220
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:52,350
What?

221
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,159
I'm exhausted!

222
00:21:55,160 --> 00:22:01,260
It's funny you can still
be sleepy when you're dead.

223
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:16,020
I wonder if you can sleep fine at all.

224
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:18,879
What? What did you say?

225
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,280
You'll regret that you
decided to stay here.

226
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,350
What did you say?

227
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:34,990
She's not even looking back.

228
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:50,339
What the heck is going on?

229
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,690
No! Don't come to me!

230
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,669
Where am I?

231
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:05,129
Why am I here?

232
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:08,340
Who's that?

233
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:15,290
Excuse me, hello?

234
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,610
Was it a dream?

235
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:22,690
Wait, why is my body not moving?

236
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:28,770
Why is my chest feel so heavy?

237
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:39,199
My goodness! Who the heck are you?

238
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:45,150
It seems like that young boy is
yelling at this old grandma, right?

239
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:49,380
Why do you care? He's so cute
even when he's screaming!

240
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,150
You're so cute!

241
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,979
What's cute about him?
He's pretty like a girl.

242
00:24:54,980 --> 00:25:00,859
Shut your mouth up. How dare you say that
when you look like you're not fully made?

243
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:05,199
Hey, what? What's wrong with my face?
When I was younger, so many women...

244
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,110
Who are these crazy people?

245
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:12,490
Hey, what's... Wait, where did she go?

246
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:15,300
Hey, Jung Se Ri!

247
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:19,339
Oh, my... Oh, my!

248
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:22,159
Hey, Jung Se Ri!

249
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,890
Hey, Jung Se Ri. Hey!

250
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,639
What is it?

251
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,179
Why is she sleeping out here?

252
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,059
Hey. Hey!

253
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,810
- Stop it!
- Oh, goodness.

254
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:47,800
Oh, my.

255
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,010
It must be exhausting for you.

256
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:59,110
She must be tired since she's going
through living hell every day.

257
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,420
Poor thing.

258
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,300
Does she live like this
with ghosts every day?

259
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:31,470
Don't worry about it, handsome Oppa.

260
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,029
That's her life, so she's used to it.

261
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:38,589
Oppa, my foot. You're at least
fifty years older than him.

262
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,589
You really don't have a conscience.

263
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:44,049
Anybody who's handsome is Oppa to me.
Do you want to die by my hand?

264
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:47,719
Am I going to die again? Hey, try it.
Go ahead and kill me.

265
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,589
- Go ahead and kill me.
- It's making me furious!

266
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,750
Be quiet!

267
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,479
Go fight somewhere else, or talk quietly.

268
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,519
That ghost with no eyes
is still very vivid to me.

269
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:04,070
It's giving me goosebumps.

270
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,189
I'm getting starving now.

271
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:15,970
But why am I getting hungry?

272
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,139
Does ghost also have to eat?

273
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,140
You surprised me!

274
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:27,969
Tell me about the ghost that you saw.

275
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:31,500
What? What ghost?

276
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,859
Yes, ma'am?

277
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:39,219
The ghost that you saw in your dream.
Tell me about it.

278
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:43,370
Oh, that ghost.

279
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:47,569
I don't remember clearly, but
I was walking on a street.

280
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:53,029
But then, suddenly, a ghost
with no eyeballs popped up.

281
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:56,200
And then?

282
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,259
What did she say? She said something
like, "It's not a place for you to be!"

283
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,859
Anyway, I've never seen something
that grotesque in my life.

284
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:08,099
Eyeballs. Are you sure it was
the ghost with no eyeballs?

285
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,600
Excuse me?

286
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,609
I'm asking, are you sure it
was the ghost with no eyeballs!

287
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:15,870
What is she saying? Why
can't I hear her clearly?

288
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:20,909
I guess this boy just became a ghost.

289
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:24,289
I'm sorry?

290
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:30,960
Are you sure you saw the
ghost with no eyeballs?

291
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,539
Yes! It was a female
ghost with no eyeballs.

292
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:39,320
- Right!
- Yes, it was a ghost with no eyeballs.

293
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,289
It was a ghost with no eyeballs.

294
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:46,530
Did you see that ghost?
I'm asking if you saw her.

295
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:48,790
- That's right. The ghost!
- Yes, yes.

296
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,229
- The ghost?
- I saw her.

297
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:53,219
Grandma? Are you talking about me?

298
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,769
The ghost.

299
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:57,940
What are you two doing?

300
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:05,130
Because of you, she woke up!
She barely slept.

301
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:09,640
What? It seems like he's
saying something to me, right?

302
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:13,390
Anyway, I'll get going first.

303
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,749
What's going on?

304
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:25,960
What? It's nothing.

305
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,810
You don't have to worry about it.

306
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:35,180
He's a good-looking guy, but his
personality is not that great.

307
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,959
It came out, right?

308
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,070
W-What are you talking about it?

309
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,270
That woman is back.

310
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:54,659
Why is she not coming? What
time does she think it is!

311
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:59,890
Why is she not coming? What
time does she think it is!

312
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:07,260
- Is she sick?
- Is she sick?

313
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,820
- Hey, why are you coming so late?
- Hey, why are you coming so late?

314
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,550
I'm sorry. I had to talk.

315
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:27,620
Talk? With whom?

316
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:30,760
Is it with a ghost again?

317
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:32,840
Don't you think so?

318
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:36,239
What kind of ghost is it this time?
A grandpa? A child?

319
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,240
Whoever it is, it's the same.

320
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:43,670
If you have to see it, I hope
it's a handsome young man's ghost.

321
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:57,669
Even though it's your friend's cafe,
how can you come this late to work?

322
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:00,010
What is it? Why are you
looking at me like that?

323
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,939
- Follow me.
- What?

324
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,849
Just follow me.

325
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:06,960
Why? Hey!

326
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:24,070
Is this the right place?

327
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,959
I think this is the correct place.
But why did you bring me here?

328
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,139
Look around carefully.
Do you remember anything?

329
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,409
What?

330
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:36,450
What do you mean what? Look around
carefully. You might remember something.

331
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:40,149
What are you saying? I
can't hear your voice!

332
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:44,030
What? What are you saying suddenly?

333
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:47,700
What's going on? I can't hear you!

334
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,719
Stop joking around.

335
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,519
Seriously, what is she saying?
It's frustrating.

336
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,070
- Hey!
- My goodness!

337
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,839
You are a ghost.

338
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,860
I'm sorry?

339
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:22,389
Did you see it? That's how you do it.

340
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,909
I'm sorry?

341
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:28,989
What? I can hear it clearly again!

342
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:31,230
Grandma!

343
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,650
It's okay. We have to solve it quickly.

344
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,399
This is amazing!

345
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,449
Can I do this to anybody?

346
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:46,290
Anyway, please think about it.
Do you remember anything more?

347
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:51,119
I don't know. When I woke up, I was here.

348
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,229
And as I walked, I went to that cafe.

349
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:56,040
How did you come to the cafe?

350
00:32:56,060 --> 00:33:00,320
Cafe... I'm not sure.

351
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:03,459
Somehow, it looked like a familiar brand.

352
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:06,449
Well, it's a franchise cafe.

353
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:09,889
Anyway, I don't remember
anything at the moment.

354
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:13,040
So...

355
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:33,590
What was it? Why did that happen?

356
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:39,189
The time you can possess someone
else's body is not that long.

357
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:43,499
What? I can hear clearly again!
Why is this happening?

358
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:48,719
It is a common phenomenon for spirits who
have just been separated from their bodies.

359
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,960
It's a bit unstable.

360
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:55,670
But it's really fascinating.

361
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:59,110
Can I do this to anybody?

362
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:17,380
Let's not bother anybody else
and talk about it over there.

363
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:27,269
It's hot.

364
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:29,329
Are you hot?

365
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:34,649
Yes, it's hot. Isn't it strange if
you don't feel hot in this weather?

366
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:37,300
Is that so?

367
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:45,149
What is it?

368
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:48,589
What the heck are you doing?
Did you just hit me?

369
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,770
Does it hurt?

370
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:54,529
Of course, it hurts! What nonsense
are you saying after hitting me?

371
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:56,819
If you feel the pain, it's weird.

372
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:00,969
What's weird for me to say
it hurts when it hurts?

373
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:08,970
Listen to me carefully.
You may not be dead.

374
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,310
Ghosts can't touch living humans.

375
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,049
Of course, it's possible when
you become an evil spirit.

376
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:20,630
Anyway, ghosts can't feel something
like hot or cold temperature.

377
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:24,010
Also, you just felt the pain.

378
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:30,460
So I think you might be still alive.

379
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:36,880
Also, I think it has a connection with
the demon that came out in your dream.

380
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:44,400
So you have to regain your
memory as soon as possible.

381
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:48,040
That way, you can go
back to your place to be.

382
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,100
I must have surprised you.

383
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:59,000
But still, it's good news.

384
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:07,040
Anyway, I'll get going first.

385
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:26,460
What the heck did she say?

386
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:30,280
I couldn't hear anything after
"Listen to me carefully!"

387
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:04,580
- What was that?
- Is it you again?

388
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,339
Who are you? Are you a pickpocket ghost?

389
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:14,650
No, you already stole
it, so are you a robber?

390
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:18,400
What the heck...!

391
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,590
Why are there so many?

392
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:35,769
It's surrounded by ghosts. It's freaky.

393
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:38,610
Hey, you better keep your stuff...

394
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,909
- Hey.
- I-I'm sorry!

395
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:46,209
What are you doing? Do you
want to die by my hand!

396
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:47,819
I mean, why do you come out like that?

397
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,029
- Are you a pervert!
- It's not like that...!

398
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,559
- So why did you...!
- Get out.

399
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,979
Get out of here, right now. Right now!

400
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:57,140
- Get out of here!
- So why are you coming out like that!

401
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,520
Get the heck out of here!

402
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:06,100
Get out of here, right now!

403
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,910
I was helping you at the thought of you.

404
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:11,940
Also, you are not my type!

405
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:17,360
My type is someone with
big eyes, a sharp nose,

406
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:22,620
tall, and looks good with long hair.

407
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,100
Wait, what?

408
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,860
Ah, come on...

409
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:55,510
Welcome.

410
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,589
Are you the owner?

411
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:02,240
No, I'm not.

412
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,820
Did the owner not be here today?

413
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,609
Yes, she went out for a bit today.
How can I help you?

414
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:11,760
She's the Managing Director
from the headquarter.

415
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,700
What's going on? Is there a problem?

416
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:23,500
No, nothing. She's the Managing
Director from the headquarter.

417
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:26,079
Is that so? But what about it?

418
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,470
- Are you the owner?
- Yes, what's going on?

419
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:32,839
Didn't a person come here from
the headquarter a few days ago?

420
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:38,359
From the headquarter? Nobody came. When
did headquarter worry about branches?

421
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,510
What's wrong with this woman's tone?

422
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:44,589
I don't know about the person from the headquarter, but
hurry up and go. You guys are in the way of the business.

423
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:49,179
- Seriously, what the...
- Please stop it.

424
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:51,710
Let's go.

425
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:03,600
Come out now.

426
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:09,869
What are you talking about it suddenly?

427
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:12,529
Come out now when I'm talking nicely.

428
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:14,880
Come out... to where?

429
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:17,389
One, two...

430
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:21,640
I get it! I'll come out.

431
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,700
I guess you are very tired.

432
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:29,869
Why don't you go inside and have some rest?

433
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:32,690
You're right. I really don't feel great.

434
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,810
Please take care of the store for a bit.

435
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,700
What the heck are you doing right now?

436
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,740
Why are you mad about it?

437
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,579
You seemed in trouble,
so I tried to save you.

438
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:56,440
Do you know how hard it is to the
person when you get into their body?

439
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,580
I get it! You really have a temper.

440
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,219
- Hey!
- Hey?

441
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,900
Yes, I called you "hey." What
are you going to do about it?

442
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,969
Can you please stop shouting?

443
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:10,920
If you keep screaming, you will
get wrinkles around here like this.

444
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:17,380
What the heck is wrong with that person?

445
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:21,600
What are you so angry about?

446
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,410
He says you'll get wrinkles here like this!

447
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:25,840
Unni!

448
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:28,679
Se Ri, do you want me to go and punch him?

449
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,810
It's fine.

450
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:32,559
Let it slide just once.

451
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,890
Why do I have to?

452
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,369
Over there.

453
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:39,159
Look over there!

454
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,040
What about it?

455
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:26,150
What are you doing over here?

456
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,789
What is it?

457
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:37,629
How did you know I was here?

458
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:40,659
Why are you sitting here looking sad?

459
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:44,209
What? Why are you being
nice to me suddenly?

460
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:46,660
You were talking informally to me before.

461
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:50,009
What's wrong with me speaking informally?
You always talk rudely to me.

462
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:53,809
What? Why are you calling
me informally again?

463
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:56,360
Speaking of it, let's
straighten out our ages.

464
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:58,280
How old are you?

465
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:00,950
Me? What about you?

466
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:02,890
I asked you first.

467
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:07,329
Why don't we take our
IDs out at the same time?

468
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:10,960
What ID do I have when I'm a ghost?

469
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:13,000
So I'm asking you. How old are you?

470
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:14,859
I don't know. It's not important.

471
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:19,419
You were always getting angry at me.
But why did you come to see me?

472
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:25,299
Well, I'm just thankful to you.

473
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,850
What?

474
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:32,500
I forgot about my birthday as well.
How did you know about it?

475
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:37,249
What do you mean how did I know? I figured because
your friend was making such a fuss about it.

476
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:40,050
Oh, because of Eun Hye.

477
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:47,150
It would've been nicer if
we had met before I died.

478
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:49,130
It's too bad.

479
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:51,970
Excuse me?

480
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:58,479
I'm saying it would've been more
fun if we had met before I died.

481
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,470
Who died?

482
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:04,139
Who died? Are you kidding me?

483
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:09,829
I talked about it at such length.
Did you already forget about it?

484
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:13,140
What? Talked about what?

485
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:15,429
I said you might not have died.

486
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:18,529
No, I'm sure you didn't die.

487
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:20,950
What?

488
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:31,890
Please! Remember it, please!

489
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:38,030
Please, remember it!

490
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:49,359
Remember it, please...

491
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:53,020
Please...

492
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:05,129
♫ Everything is the same ♫

493
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:11,739
♫ But only me, without anyone knowing ♫

494
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:15,759
♫ As if I came back after
living in a different world ♫

495
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,270
♫ Even the morning
sunshine looks unfamiliar ♫

496
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:25,509
♫ Only because you are not here ♫

497
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:31,289
♫ Now it's time to wake up.
Now it's time to wake up ♫

498
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:33,199
It's okay.

499
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,059
You don't have to rush.

500
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:39,080
We can do it slowly.

501
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:47,810
♫ The dream called you, the dream
that I don't want to wake up from ♫

502
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:51,329
♫ I'll let you go just that much ♫

503
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:57,140
♫ I'll say goodbye a little by little ♫

504
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:08,619
♫ By looking at my phone
that's not ringing ♫

505
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:15,230
♫ And while longing for
you who disappeared ♫

506
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:19,289
♫ When painful tears fall down ♫

507
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:22,939
It's okay, it's okay.

508
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:30,040
♫ Only faded memories remain ♫

509
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:21,040
Slamming brake, a crosswalk, and a minivan.

510
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:24,009
Car accident and a syringe.

511
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:27,579
If you look at the situation,
it sounds like a car accident.

512
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:30,380
But what is this syringe for?

513
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:36,490
Excuse me, customer. Are
you not going to work?

514
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,669
Why don't you drink this?

515
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:43,079
Wow, you're totally ignoring me now.

516
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,709
It's Colombian Supremo coffee.

517
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:49,040
- Supremo?
- Yes, it's Supremo coffee. What about it?

518
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:50,939
How did you know that?

519
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:52,129
What?

520
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:56,749
How did you know this coffee is
made with Supremo coffee beans?

521
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,279
I'm not sure.

522
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,560
Excuse me.

523
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:02,110
Yes, sir!

524
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:05,469
Hey, you better get back to work
before I hire another barista.

525
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:09,260
You are really... I get it!

526
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:45,029
How did it go with what I ordered?

527
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:48,530
I executed immaculately.

528
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:52,129
You never know, so please
check it one more time.

529
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:54,320
Yes, sir.

530
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:14,190
Are you not going to get on?

531
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:37,380
What about Ji Chan?

532
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:40,110
Not yet.

533
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,569
Are you looking for him at all?

534
00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:45,370
Of course, very much!

535
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:49,769
I'm looking for him very much!

536
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:52,069
It's not like you don't
want to find him, is it?

537
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:55,709
Me? Why would I?

538
00:49:55,710 --> 00:49:58,450
If it's not, it's fine.

539
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,900
What's that discomforting answer?

540
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:19,010
That girl is not okay as well.

541
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:34,080
You are going to make the ground sink.

542
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:43,529
How did you know I was here?

543
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:46,740
I just saw you while I was passing by.

544
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:50,829
Is that so.

545
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:53,680
But why are you keep sighing?

546
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:56,219
Nothing special.

547
00:50:56,220 --> 00:51:02,420
It's kind of ridiculous
that I can't remember.

548
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:08,550
And I feel pathetic about myself right now.

549
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:16,069
Sometimes, it's happier when
you don't remember anything.

550
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:18,769
What?

551
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:26,770
I have a day I clearly remember,
which I don't want to recall.

552
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:32,090
My family was wealthy before.

553
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:36,550
My dad was running a company called A1.

554
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:40,580
What is this? Are you bragging
about your wealthy family suddenly?

555
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:46,210
Just listen to me. I usually don't talk
about this, but I'm telling you specially.

556
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,070
So what happened after that?

557
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:56,860
Was it when I was ten years old?
My dad's company went bankrupt.

558
00:51:56,870 --> 00:52:00,440
My mom killed herself because of it.

559
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:06,020
And my dad passed away soon
after because of that shock.

560
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:12,960
I still remember that day vividly.

561
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,209
It keeps coming out in my dream as well.

562
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:20,999
Anyway, it all started on that day.

563
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,639
That's when I began to
see ghosts around me.

564
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,840
Is that so.

565
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:34,850
But what's more upsetting is that my dad's company went
bankrupt because of his friend, who he trusted the most.

566
00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:36,930
What?

567
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:39,929
I don't know more in detail.

568
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:44,449
But it's said that he intentionally played around
with stocks to take over my dad's company's share.

569
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:46,650
What kind of bastard is that?

570
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:49,329
Don't you have to catch
them and put them in jail?

571
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:52,480
It's really infuriating!

572
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,439
What is it?

573
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,799
Thank you.

574
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,259
What about it?

575
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:04,339
Thank you for cursing them for me.

576
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:06,930
Hey, it's okay for you to curse them.

577
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:10,159
Anybody who did something to
be cursed should be cursed.

578
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:13,499
Okay, repeat after me.

579
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:17,919
Hey, you bastards. Go to hell! Try it.

580
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,769
Hey, you bastards. Go to hell.

581
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:24,939
What are you doing? You
have to say it stronger.

582
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:28,050
Hey, you bastards! You all go to hell!

583
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,730
Try it again.

584
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:33,419
Hey, you bastards. Go to hell!

585
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:36,639
Can you do it again?

586
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:39,870
Hey, you bastards! Go to hell!

587
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:42,019
Yes! There you go.

588
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:45,610
- Okay, one more time.
- Can you show it to me again?

589
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:48,589
Hey, you bastards. Go to hell!

590
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:52,030
Hey, you bastards! Go to hell!

591
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:55,929
Yes, you are good at it! Try it louder.

592
00:53:55,930 --> 00:54:00,890
Hey, you bastards! Go to hell!

593
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:30,289
Is he not home?

594
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:32,900
Hello?

595
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:37,830
What? Did he go somewhere?

596
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,669
Song Ji Chan.

597
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:43,959
Hey, rude boy!

598
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:47,029
Rude boy?

599
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:49,560
Rude boy?

600
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:55,020
Where did he go?

601
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:01,050
Rude boy?

602
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:11,870
Where have you been without telling me?

603
00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:38,150
Don't come to me!

604
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:40,169
Jung Se Ri, are you okay?

605
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:42,090
Yes...

606
00:57:43,610 --> 00:57:48,139
Jung Se Ri! Wake up!

607
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:50,960
Jung Se Ri. Jung Se Ri!

608
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:55,070
Please wake up. Jung Se Ri?

609
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:09,300
Her body temperature dropped tremendously.

610
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:12,890
This often happens when a
spirit fails to possess.

611
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:18,519
What can I do for her?

612
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:21,720
Stay by her side.

613
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:05,960
♫ It feels like I dreamt
a very long dream ♫

614
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:13,030
♫ When I open my eyes, you aren't there ♫

615
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:20,329
♫ It comes to me as a distant memory,
but also clear as if it was yesterday ♫

616
00:59:20,330 --> 00:59:26,399
♫ As if I dreamt a very nice dream ♫

617
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,989
♫ Now it's time to wake up ♫

618
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:34,050
♫ It's time to say goodbye to you ♫

619
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:41,819
♫ It's scary to forget everything,
but it's painful to hold onto you ♫

620
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:48,629
♫ The dream called you, the dream
that I don't want to wake up from ♫

621
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:52,229
♫ I'll let you go just that much ♫

622
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:57,610
♫ I'll say goodbye a little by little ♫

623
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:00,300
Thank you.

624
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:04,020
Jung Se Ri.

625
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:18,550
Is she dead?

626
01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:24,030
She's still breathing.

627
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:31,909
Can you hear us?

628
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:34,190
Why are you all looking at me like that?

629
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,250
Thank goodness. She's alive.

630
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:41,940
God, Buddha, thank you all so much!

631
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:49,909
What happened? Why have I lied down here?

632
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:52,190
Do you not remember?

633
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:56,349
It's already been two days. We
thought you were going to die.

634
01:00:56,350 --> 01:00:59,539
That evil spirit was trying to... Ouch!

635
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:03,400
- What's wrong with you?
- Be quiet!

636
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:13,960
But why is he sleeping here?

637
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:19,390
That rude boy has been protecting you for
two days straight and fell asleep now.

638
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:22,230
Grandma, he's not a rude boy.

639
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:27,719
Okay, let's let Se Ri have some rest.
Let's all go out of the room.

640
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:32,030
Okay. Have some rest, Jung Se Ri.

641
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:51,050
Oh, at that time...

642
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:08,600
Yes, what is it?

643
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:11,140
We found him.

644
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:17,020
Is he... alive?

645
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:32,850
This is your sister. Your sister is here!

646
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:35,809
Please, open your eyes.

647
01:02:35,810 --> 01:02:39,280
What happened to you?

648
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:45,299
I'm so sorry we found you late.

649
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:49,499
I'm really sorry.

650
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:55,050
Ma'am, please calm down
and listen to the doctor.

651
01:02:57,090 --> 01:02:59,749
How is he right now?

652
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:04,330
Fortunately, it's not life-threatening,
but he's still in a coma.

653
01:03:04,370 --> 01:03:06,449
We are doing our best, but
we have to wait and see...

654
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:11,839
He'll wake up. My brother will.

655
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:13,730
Please take great care of him.

656
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:17,010
We'll do our best.

657
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:10,040
I'm sorry, ma'am.

658
01:04:57,050 --> 01:04:59,630
Ji Min.

659
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:26,330
Ji Min, it's nice to walk together.

660
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:39,770
But this neighborhood is in the
opposite direction of Ji Min's house.

661
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,940
Wait, Ji Min. Let's go together!

662
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:58,889
J-Ji Min?

663
01:05:58,890 --> 01:06:01,540
Ji Min!

664
01:06:01,570 --> 01:06:07,189
Ji Min, wake up. Please, Ji Min!

665
01:06:07,190 --> 01:06:09,700
Ji Min!

666
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:39,809
- Grandma.
- What?

667
01:06:39,810 --> 01:06:43,370
How long will you just wait
and stare at it from here?

668
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:45,469
Let's just borrow her body for a second.

669
01:06:45,470 --> 01:06:48,470
- Shall we?
- Yes.

670
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:51,809
What? Me?

671
01:06:51,810 --> 01:06:55,540
- Don't you know respecting your elder?
- Respect your elder.

672
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:57,940
Then why don't you go inside...

673
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:11,030
Oh, I found him!

674
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:15,819
VIP ward, Song Ji Chan.
[Personal Information of Patients]

675
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:18,600
Okay.

676
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:14,230
Am I already drunk?

677
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:11,380
W-Who are you...?

678
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:24,560
Please don't come to me...!

679
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:17,060
What was it? Was it a dream...?

680
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:37,349
Who are you?!

681
01:10:37,350 --> 01:10:40,569
Take me inside of you.

682
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:42,729
Who are you!

683
01:10:42,730 --> 01:10:46,300
Why are you doing this to me?

684
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:52,750
Take me in.

685
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:56,910
No, no...!

686
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:06,069
You can get what you want.

687
01:11:06,070 --> 01:11:10,899
What are you talking about right now?

688
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:17,610
I'll let you have what you want.

689
01:11:20,490 --> 01:11:22,319
What I want?

690
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:26,569
Yes. What you want.

691
01:11:26,570 --> 01:11:32,080
What I want...

692
01:11:36,790 --> 01:11:43,640
What I want...?

693
01:11:51,860 --> 01:11:58,510
The things that I want...

694
01:12:35,890 --> 01:12:39,009
What? What is it?

695
01:12:39,010 --> 01:12:41,350
Respect your elder.

696
01:12:41,370 --> 01:12:43,549
Again? No, I don't want to!

697
01:12:43,550 --> 01:12:46,719
It feels like I'm getting ten years
older when I possess someone's body!

698
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:52,219
Is ten years an issue when you can disappear
forever? Stop talking nonsense and go!

699
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:55,319
No, this time I really don't want to!

700
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:59,859
Why don't you send him instead?
Hey, you should go.

701
01:12:59,860 --> 01:13:03,160
Why all of a sudden bring me into this?
You two should figure it out.

702
01:13:03,190 --> 01:13:05,009
- You go this time.
- No, you go!

703
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:07,769
You weren't doing anything. You go!

704
01:13:07,770 --> 01:13:10,340
I'll go inside.

705
01:13:12,450 --> 01:13:17,279
Who's this new face that
appeared out of the blue?

706
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:21,599
He's not a new face. He comes to the cafe
sometimes. You know, that pure-love guy.

707
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:25,579
I have worked here before, so I know
the company's layout well. Let me do it.

708
01:13:25,580 --> 01:13:26,749
Will you?

709
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:29,319
I just need to go in and get Song
Ji Chan's information, right?

710
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:32,910
Yes, that's right. Okay.

711
01:13:32,930 --> 01:13:35,190
I'll be back.

712
01:13:38,770 --> 01:13:44,080
Something's suspicious about him.

713
01:14:15,740 --> 01:14:19,670
What brings you here?

714
01:14:19,710 --> 01:14:22,049
You look very relaxed.

715
01:14:22,050 --> 01:14:29,270
No, I'm busy. I'm just cooling
my head off for a second.

716
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:31,239
Is that so?

717
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:34,719
Oh, that's right. I saw you bought stocks.

718
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,149
W-What?

719
01:14:36,150 --> 01:14:40,889
Why are you so shocked? It's not
like you did something illegal.

720
01:14:40,890 --> 01:14:45,830
Nothing. I'm just a bit surprised.

721
01:14:45,860 --> 01:14:48,810
Since you suddenly talk
about stocks out of nowhere.

722
01:14:48,850 --> 01:14:53,210
I'll cut to the point. Give me that stock.

723
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:54,519
What?

724
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,859
Why do you keep making me say it twice?

725
01:14:56,860 --> 01:15:00,019
What's up with your confidence?

726
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:04,109
Do you want to be disappeared
as well like Ji Chan?

727
01:15:04,110 --> 01:15:07,769
J-Ji Chan?

728
01:15:07,770 --> 01:15:14,310
What? It sounds like you
did something to Ji Chan.

729
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:25,020
Hey, hey! It hurts!

730
01:15:25,050 --> 01:15:29,720
It hurts... It hurts!

731
01:15:37,830 --> 01:15:40,009
What's this?

732
01:15:40,010 --> 01:15:42,089
Until this week.

733
01:15:42,090 --> 01:15:46,280
Sign this, and put it on my desk.

734
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:57,450
What the heck is this thing?

735
01:15:57,490 --> 01:16:00,609
[Stock Transfer Agreement]

736
01:16:00,610 --> 01:16:05,000
Stock transfer agreement...?

737
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:24,560
What should we do?

738
01:16:24,570 --> 01:16:28,839
I feel bad for our
prince, Ji Chan, as well.

739
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:31,560
But what should we do with our poor Se Ri?

740
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:33,629
Let's reveal everything.

741
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:37,770
If we reveal everything, how
will you deal with the aftermath?

742
01:16:39,450 --> 01:16:43,040
Revealing everything? About what?

743
01:16:54,660 --> 01:16:58,669
Are you saying you'll transfer your
stocks to Managing Director Song?

744
01:16:58,670 --> 01:17:02,609
Yes, including all of my shares.

745
01:17:02,610 --> 01:17:05,620
But why all of a sudden?

746
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:08,970
Ji Eun completely changed.

747
01:17:09,010 --> 01:17:13,380
She was crushing my wrist like a Hulk...!

748
01:17:13,390 --> 01:17:15,920
It was horrifying! It still hurts.

749
01:17:15,940 --> 01:17:19,020
Should I tag a person to her?

750
01:17:19,030 --> 01:17:20,689
A person?

751
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:25,469
Why don't you put a tail on her
first and see who made her do so?

752
01:17:25,470 --> 01:17:32,489
Thinking of Managing Director Song's personality,
she would've not decided on it alone.

753
01:17:32,490 --> 01:17:35,309
Right?

754
01:17:35,310 --> 01:17:38,079
I'll send a trustworthy person right away.

755
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:40,369
Okay, let's do so. Hurry up and go.

756
01:17:40,370 --> 01:17:43,460
Yes, I'll hurry up and go.

757
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:05,209
So you're saying he's the youngest son of
the KS Group's Chairman Song Young Sik.

758
01:18:05,210 --> 01:18:06,930
Yes.

759
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:09,249
And you know who's the KS Group.

760
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:15,310
It's the company that illegally acquired
your father's company, A1 Group.

761
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:19,059
Because of that guy, your
mother took her own life away.

762
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:23,900
And your father passed away from the
stress. They are your arch enemy.

763
01:18:23,950 --> 01:18:26,760
That terrible bastard.
What did I say before?

764
01:18:26,770 --> 01:18:29,279
I told you I had bad feelings
for that punk from the beginning!

765
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:32,649
But our prince doesn't even know who he is!

766
01:18:32,650 --> 01:18:35,419
Also, he didn't do anything!

767
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:39,159
I knew it. I knew it from when he
was saying Supremo coffee and stuff.

768
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:42,130
- It's not like that...
- Stop it!

769
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:46,370
Se Ri.

770
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:50,930
You know that evil spirit has
come to you recently, right?

771
01:18:50,970 --> 01:18:55,750
When evil spirits can't possess any human
body, they eat spirits like us to survive.

772
01:18:55,790 --> 01:18:57,539
You've been sleeping
well these days, right?

773
01:18:57,540 --> 01:19:01,830
It's because of the evil spirit
that other ghosts can't come.

774
01:19:03,650 --> 01:19:06,679
It's not certain yet.

775
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:10,599
But I think Ji Chan has
the power of exorcising.

776
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:13,330
The power of exorcising?

777
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:17,700
There were no spirits in history that
could fight against evil spirits.

778
01:19:17,730 --> 01:19:20,230
But you also saw it.

779
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:25,350
If Ji Chan can put the evil
spirit into a corner that much,

780
01:19:25,370 --> 01:19:29,320
he definitely has the energy of exorcism.

781
01:19:29,350 --> 01:19:33,889
So we have to trust Ji Chan on this.

782
01:19:33,890 --> 01:19:37,800
But there's no guarantee that the rude punk will
win the fight with the evil spirit, isn't it?

783
01:19:37,820 --> 01:19:42,059
If that happens...!

784
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:45,150
You use this.

785
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:55,599
What is this?

786
01:19:55,600 --> 01:20:00,000
It's called "Spirit box," which
I got from an exorcist who died.

787
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:05,300
It's a box that can put spirits in it.

788
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:10,960
When it opens, it sucks in
entire spirits around it.

789
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:14,809
So if I open it, I go into the box, too.

790
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:20,380
In the worst-case scenario,
you open this box, Se Ri.

791
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:27,869
I have a question.

792
01:20:27,870 --> 01:20:35,870
What happens to Song Ji Chan if he
loses the fight with the evil spirit?

793
01:20:36,650 --> 01:20:42,569
Well, if he loses the fight, then...

794
01:20:42,570 --> 01:20:46,859
He'll disappear forever.

795
01:20:46,860 --> 01:20:51,020
Including his soul.

796
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:06,370
Exorcism?

797
01:21:23,470 --> 01:21:26,790
Hasn't it come in yet?

798
01:21:26,810 --> 01:21:29,370
Okay.

799
01:21:32,090 --> 01:21:37,379
Look at this bastard. He
lost his sense of fear.

800
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:40,389
Managing Director.

801
01:21:40,390 --> 01:21:43,750
I think someone's following us.

802
01:22:37,010 --> 01:22:40,539
Who is it? Who made you follow me?

803
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:43,069
I don't know...!

804
01:22:43,070 --> 01:22:45,259
Is it Song Ji Seok?

805
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:50,470
I only got an order to follow you.

806
01:23:14,810 --> 01:23:20,510
Sir, he's not picking up the phone.

807
01:23:20,530 --> 01:23:24,490
I asked him to tail her,
but he went off the grid!

808
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:27,580
He must be still following her right now...!

809
01:23:27,620 --> 01:23:31,929
He's following her, but what?!

810
01:23:31,930 --> 01:23:34,819
Ji Chan... Did you find Ji Chan?

811
01:23:34,820 --> 01:23:36,820
Not yet, sir...

812
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:39,809
I'm sure Ji Eun took him away.

813
01:23:39,810 --> 01:23:44,049
I'm sure the two are
excited together right now.

814
01:23:44,050 --> 01:23:46,060
[Stock Transfer Agreement]

815
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:55,480
It wasn't easy for me to get these stocks, and
now she wants them for free? That's nonsense!

816
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:57,809
Call him again and ask him how it went!

817
01:23:57,810 --> 01:23:59,900
Yes, sir.

818
01:24:06,730 --> 01:24:10,810
What? Where is that sound coming from?

819
01:24:14,210 --> 01:24:16,970
What? You...

820
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:30,409
What is this?

821
01:24:30,410 --> 01:24:35,169
I think you'll know better.

822
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:38,149
I don't know! How do I know about this?

823
01:24:38,150 --> 01:24:41,080
This is just...

824
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:47,579
I guess you have a lot in mind these days.

825
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:50,670
N-No, it's not like that.

826
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:55,510
It says transfer, so I was
going to write as giving up.

827
01:24:55,540 --> 01:25:01,229
Why don't you two have a conversation?
I'll let you have some privacy.

828
01:25:01,230 --> 01:25:04,329
Where do you think you are going?

829
01:25:04,330 --> 01:25:06,670
Pardon?

830
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:09,390
I'm asking, where are you going?

831
01:25:09,410 --> 01:25:12,980
I was just going to close the door for you.

832
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:30,400
You were going to give up, not transfer.

833
01:25:30,420 --> 01:25:33,350
Yes, that's right. Giving up
is the correct word, isn't it?

834
01:25:33,370 --> 01:25:36,069
If I transfer it to you, the tax is heavy.

835
01:25:36,070 --> 01:25:39,629
And shareholders will gossip about
it that it's insider trading.

836
01:25:39,630 --> 01:25:41,489
So if I simply give up, you can...

837
01:25:41,490 --> 01:25:44,699
Now that I heard of it,
giving up is correct.

838
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:48,000
Right? Giving up is correct.

839
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:54,489
You'll die anyway, so it doesn't matter
if you give it up or transfer it to me.

840
01:25:54,490 --> 01:26:00,309
Hey... Why are you saying
it so scary like that?

841
01:26:00,310 --> 01:26:02,849
I was going to transfer it
to you as soon as possible.

842
01:26:02,850 --> 01:26:06,610
But this punk said you took Ji
Chan away and scheming stuff.

843
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:09,869
No! I just did it because the
Vice President ordered me!

844
01:26:09,870 --> 01:26:14,619
What, you bastard? You said we
should tag a person to her first.

845
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:16,929
You made me do so!

846
01:26:16,930 --> 01:26:20,230
Are you out of your mind!

847
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:22,810
Be quiet.

848
01:26:25,410 --> 01:26:27,670
You.

849
01:26:27,710 --> 01:26:30,829
Yes, Managing Director.

850
01:26:30,830 --> 01:26:34,779
- Kill him.
- I'm sorry?

851
01:26:34,780 --> 01:26:36,479
Hey, you!

852
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:39,709
I said, kill him.

853
01:26:39,710 --> 01:26:45,360
How can I do that to the Vice President...?

854
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:58,300
Wait, Director Kang... Director Kang!

855
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:42,940
Welcome...

856
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:07,600
Are you okay?

857
01:28:10,210 --> 01:28:13,610
I'm fine.

858
01:28:13,620 --> 01:28:17,389
Thank goodness the wounds
didn't hit the critical spots.

859
01:28:17,390 --> 01:28:21,229
Let me see.

860
01:28:21,230 --> 01:28:28,479
The burn is also not that bad, so
you'll be okay if you rest a few days.

861
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:30,510
Where have you been?

862
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:32,219
Who did this to you?

863
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:33,929
Were you worried about me?

864
01:28:33,930 --> 01:28:38,169
Of course, I was worried about you.
How can I not worry?

865
01:28:38,170 --> 01:28:41,620
How can I not be worried about you when
you were gone after seeing you every day?

866
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:43,249
It hurts!

867
01:28:43,250 --> 01:28:46,980
What hurts when you are a ghost?
Also, you need to get punished more.

868
01:28:47,010 --> 01:28:50,530
My goodness! I went to the company.

869
01:28:52,690 --> 01:28:56,029
The company?

870
01:28:56,030 --> 01:28:58,640
KS Group.

871
01:29:00,390 --> 01:29:03,839
Did your memory come back...?

872
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:08,969
Not all of them, but a
little bit came back.

873
01:29:08,970 --> 01:29:12,859
How much do you remember?

874
01:29:12,860 --> 01:29:15,989
The fact that I was working in the company,

875
01:29:15,990 --> 01:29:20,539
and I had an older brother and a sister.

876
01:29:20,540 --> 01:29:24,750
Then why did you get these wounds?

877
01:29:24,770 --> 01:29:29,289
What? I just fell and tumbled.

878
01:29:29,290 --> 01:29:31,489
What?

879
01:29:31,490 --> 01:29:37,770
I'm a bit tired. I think I need to rest.

880
01:29:41,180 --> 01:29:43,279
Yes, he's right.

881
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:46,299
He should have some rest.

882
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:49,140
Why don't we leave him alone?

883
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:17,229
Get out!

884
01:30:17,230 --> 01:30:19,449
Get out of my body now!

885
01:30:19,450 --> 01:30:22,350
Please! Get out!

886
01:30:24,380 --> 01:30:27,270
Are you afraid?

887
01:30:34,740 --> 01:30:37,170
There's nothing for you to be scared of.

888
01:30:37,180 --> 01:30:38,719
You...

889
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:41,609
You are the one who made a choice.

890
01:30:41,610 --> 01:30:44,879
You can't take it back anymore.

891
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:46,970
Please get out of me now.

892
01:30:46,990 --> 01:30:51,759
I don't need anything anymore. I
don't need anything, so please leave!

893
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:55,570
Now, I'm the one who's making the decision.

894
01:30:55,610 --> 01:30:57,349
What?

895
01:30:57,350 --> 01:31:02,189
You have no choice.

896
01:31:02,190 --> 01:31:06,310
No, no...

897
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:38,370
♫ It feels like I dreamt
a very long dream ♫

898
01:31:38,380 --> 01:31:40,940
♫ When I open my eyes, you aren't there ♫

899
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:44,080
I'm sorry, Jung Se Ri.

900
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:52,629
I guess the one who made you
miserable is me, after all.

901
01:31:52,630 --> 01:31:59,220
♫ As if I dreamt a very nice dream ♫

902
01:31:59,240 --> 01:32:02,979
I'll bring everything
back to you from now on.

903
01:32:02,980 --> 01:32:06,469
I'll give your father's company back.

904
01:32:06,470 --> 01:32:09,680
And I'll bring back your bright smile, too.

905
01:32:09,710 --> 01:32:15,259
I'll bring you back to the happy time.

906
01:32:15,260 --> 01:32:18,370
I'll get back everything.

907
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:26,979
Thank you, Jung Se Ri.

908
01:32:26,980 --> 01:32:30,499
♫ Now it's time to wake up ♫

909
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:34,680
♫ It's time to say goodbye to you ♫

910
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:42,419
♫ It's scary to forget everything,
but it's painful to hold onto you ♫

911
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:49,460
♫ The dream called you, the dream
that I don't want to wake up from ♫

912
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:52,790
♫ I'll let you go just that much ♫

913
01:32:52,830 --> 01:32:58,739
♫ I'll say goodbye a little by little ♫

914
01:32:58,740 --> 01:33:01,590
What made you come to work this early?

915
01:33:01,610 --> 01:33:04,079
I guess the sun will rise in the west.

916
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:08,559
That's what I have to say. Why are you
making coffee this early in the morning?

917
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:11,270
Have a seat over there.

918
01:33:23,430 --> 01:33:26,460
Eat this.

919
01:33:29,730 --> 01:33:31,739
Thank you for the food.

920
01:33:31,740 --> 01:33:34,560
Song Ji Chan.

921
01:33:43,940 --> 01:33:47,320
It was too obvious.

922
01:34:03,710 --> 01:34:08,019
Hello! You haven't visited in a while.
I guess you were busy.

923
01:34:08,020 --> 01:34:12,530
Yes, a little bit.

924
01:34:12,550 --> 01:34:15,659
- Se Ri.
- Yes?

925
01:34:15,660 --> 01:34:18,570
Somebody came to see you outside.

926
01:34:18,610 --> 01:34:20,649
To see me?

927
01:34:20,650 --> 01:34:22,349
Yes.

928
01:34:22,350 --> 01:34:26,640
Who would that be? Excuse me for a second.

929
01:34:40,570 --> 01:34:44,150
What is it? Who came to see me?

930
01:35:05,220 --> 01:35:06,929
Hey...!

931
01:35:06,930 --> 01:35:10,520
What's wrong? Why are you in such a hurry?

932
01:35:10,540 --> 01:35:13,279
- Se Ri got...!
- What happened to Jung Se Ri?

933
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:15,639
Se Ri got abducted by bad people!

934
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:18,060
What?

935
01:36:07,420 --> 01:36:10,349
Why is she not picking up her phone?

936
01:36:10,350 --> 01:36:13,600
If she comes, I'm really
going to fire her this time.

937
01:36:13,610 --> 01:36:18,479
It's so frustrating. You have the
location tracking on her, you stupid girl!

938
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:21,970
If she doesn't pick up her phone, you have
to track her location and call the police!

939
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:26,369
It's so frustrating. It's driving me crazy!

940
01:36:26,370 --> 01:36:30,010
- Excuse me.
- Yes!

941
01:36:35,290 --> 01:36:37,560
It's Incheon.

942
01:36:37,590 --> 01:36:39,359
Hey, you!

943
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:42,879
Seriously, he's so impatient.

944
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,059
He'll be all right, won't he?

945
01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:47,380
- Let's hurry up and go, too.
- Go where?

946
01:36:47,390 --> 01:36:49,940
Of course, we are going to Incheon!

947
01:36:51,490 --> 01:36:53,409
What are you doing? Aren't you coming?

948
01:36:53,410 --> 01:36:56,459
Well, I'm not feeling that great.

949
01:36:56,460 --> 01:37:00,570
- Are you not coming?
- Coming!

950
01:37:41,100 --> 01:37:44,400
Who are you?

951
01:37:47,010 --> 01:37:50,030
You can leave the room.

952
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:12,669
W-What is it?

953
01:38:12,670 --> 01:38:15,370
Who are you to do this to me?

954
01:38:15,410 --> 01:38:18,059
Didn't we meet before?

955
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:20,600
We met once in the cafe.

956
01:38:20,620 --> 01:38:24,339
Don't you remember?

957
01:38:24,340 --> 01:38:27,270
Are you the older sister of Song Ji Chan?

958
01:38:27,310 --> 01:38:32,400
Yes. Your memory isn't that bad.

959
01:38:32,430 --> 01:38:36,390
But why would you do this to me?

960
01:38:40,530 --> 01:38:45,070
Why do you think I brought you here?

961
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:56,700
You are...

962
01:38:59,870 --> 01:39:02,159
No, not yet!

963
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:04,799
It's not the time for you to come out yet!

964
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:08,519
Give me what I want first. Then
I'll give you what you want!

965
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:12,229
Are you crazy? Do you know what
kind of thing you have done?

966
01:39:12,230 --> 01:39:14,229
It doesn't matter!

967
01:39:14,230 --> 01:39:17,349
What?

968
01:39:17,350 --> 01:39:22,399
If I can get what I want, I
don't care about any other thing!

969
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:25,299
You are out of your mind.

970
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:28,989
Song Ji Chan will come here.

971
01:39:28,990 --> 01:39:32,159
I just need to get rid of him.

972
01:39:32,160 --> 01:39:34,910
No...!

973
01:39:46,730 --> 01:39:50,329
What's going on? That
rude boy is not in here.

974
01:39:50,330 --> 01:39:53,050
What about Se Ri?

975
01:39:53,090 --> 01:39:55,240
She's with the evil spirit.

976
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:57,499
- I-Is the evil spirit in there, too?
- Yes.

977
01:39:57,500 --> 01:39:59,999
- Let's go in there.
- How can we go there just like this?

978
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,909
He says the evil spirit is there.

979
01:40:01,910 --> 01:40:04,499
Let's watch the situation
a bit more and then go in.

980
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:08,650
Watch what? What if
something happens to her?

981
01:40:08,690 --> 01:40:12,790
Where did the prince go?
It's driving me crazy.

982
01:40:12,820 --> 01:40:14,649
I can't wait any longer. Let's go!

983
01:40:14,650 --> 01:40:17,620
Grandma. Grandma!

984
01:40:17,650 --> 01:40:22,290
Seriously... Grandma!

985
01:40:26,710 --> 01:40:29,610
You're here.

986
01:40:39,050 --> 01:40:40,809
What the heck are these?

987
01:40:40,810 --> 01:40:42,109
Grandma!

988
01:40:42,110 --> 01:40:45,340
Se Ri, are you okay?

989
01:40:49,450 --> 01:40:52,100
Grandma!

990
01:41:02,170 --> 01:41:06,010
No, Song Ji Chan!

991
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:24,360
No!

992
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:34,149
Why did you come here? Leave here, now!

993
01:41:34,150 --> 01:41:35,819
I told you I'd protect you.

994
01:41:35,820 --> 01:41:39,850
Don't worry about me and please go!

[3 months later]

1010
01:45:22,860 --> 01:45:26,050
- Excuse me.
- Yes!

1011
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:34,150
You can click here like this.

1012
01:45:40,830 --> 01:45:46,699
It's good to see her smiling, at least.

1013
01:45:46,700 --> 01:45:49,419
I'm glad.

1014
01:45:49,420 --> 01:45:54,859
What are you so glad about?
She can't even see us anymore.

1015
01:45:54,860 --> 01:45:59,049
Now our wish is gone out
of the window, right?

1016
01:45:59,050 --> 01:46:03,430
What? Were you still
clinging to that wish thing?

1017
01:46:03,460 --> 01:46:05,659
Were you still around here because of that?

1018
01:46:05,660 --> 01:46:11,040
It's not just because of
that, but a little bit.

1019
01:46:11,060 --> 01:46:14,960
Both of you, be quiet!

1020
01:46:14,980 --> 01:46:20,459
I think now it's time for us to go, too.

1021
01:46:20,460 --> 01:46:27,959
Take care, Jung Se Ri.

1022
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:31,060
Let's go.

1023
01:46:43,140 --> 01:46:48,070
Farewell. Thank you so much for everything.

1024
01:46:50,450 --> 01:46:52,640
Jung Se Ri, what are you doing?

1025
01:46:52,660 --> 01:46:54,670
I'm coming!

1026
01:46:56,150 --> 01:47:00,000
Why are you making such a fuss?
Take it easy.

1027
01:47:00,040 --> 01:47:03,910
It's because it's so busy. I don't
know why it's so hectic these days.

1028
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:07,930
It's good to be busy.
You'll be rich, ma'am.

1029
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:12,469
I got to buy a building as soon as
possible and get out of this life.

1030
01:47:12,470 --> 01:47:16,990
- I think the coffee beans arrived. Can you take that?
- Okay.
