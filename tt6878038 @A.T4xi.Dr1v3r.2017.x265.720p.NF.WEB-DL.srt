1
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:57,640
(This film is based on true events.)

2
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,365
(Spring 1980, Seoul)

3
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:20,748
That girl who once gave me a bouquet of flowers...

4
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:30,338
Why do I miss her so much today?

5
00:01:33,192 --> 00:01:39,640
Her neatly bobbed hair,
like a rain-soaked blade of grass...

6
00:01:42,488 --> 00:01:48,760
Her sparkling eyes still shine in my heart.

7
00:01:51,736 --> 00:02:00,280
At times when I feel lonely, I remember that day...

8
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:09,496
At times when I miss her, I begin to dream...

9
00:02:11,976 --> 00:02:18,468
That longing I can't forget...

10
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:27,832
How cruel that time has taken her away.

11
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:45,791
(A TAXI DRIVER)

12
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,791
Private Taxi

13
00:02:45,992 --> 00:02:47,251
- Lift the state of emergency!
- Lift it! Lift it!
Private Taxi

14
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:49,498
- Lift the state of emergency!
- Lift it! Lift it!

15
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,255
No more martial law!

16
00:02:51,248 --> 00:02:53,416
No more! No more!

17
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,178
What, is it an accident?

18
00:02:59,336 --> 00:03:02,558
Disperse, or we will act with force!

19
00:03:02,968 --> 00:03:04,184
I repeat.

20
00:03:05,192 --> 00:03:06,440
Disperse,

21
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:08,272
or we will act with force!

22
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,978
I wondered why today was so quiet.

23
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,528
Did they go to university to protest?

24
00:03:19,176 --> 00:03:21,028
Enough is enough...

25
00:03:43,448 --> 00:03:46,348
Spoiled bastards need
to be shipped off to Saudi Arabia.

26
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,605
Work themselves to death in the burning desert,

27
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:53,609
then they'll realize, "Wow, my country is great!"

28
00:04:05,788 --> 00:04:07,368
How can you dash at my car?

29
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,208
If you jump out like that...

30
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:11,085
Run!

31
00:04:11,078 --> 00:04:12,503
Hey, where are you going?

32
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:13,837
Hey, you!

33
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:15,089
Get back here!

34
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:16,465
- Stop!
- Taxi!

35
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,965
Taxi!

36
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:21,720
That...

37
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,640
To the hospital, quickly!

38
00:04:30,998 --> 00:04:32,608
Mister, please go faster.

39
00:04:32,608 --> 00:04:35,692
The first baby takes a long time,
even after the water breaks.

40
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:39,108
My wife spent 12 hours in the delivery room.

41
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,392
The first baby's always like that.

42
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:44,576
Hey, hey, hey...

43
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:47,913
No more martial law!

44
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:53,001
Don't tell me you're that close!

45
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:55,587
Oh, whatever.

46
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:02,845
(Throw out the dictatorship and bring in democracy!)

47
00:05:05,496 --> 00:05:06,932
We're here, honey.

48
00:05:13,768 --> 00:05:15,941
My best driving ever!

49
00:05:16,536 --> 00:05:18,536
This way.

50
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:20,737
Other taxi drivers won't take pregnant women.

51
00:05:20,728 --> 00:05:23,068
But I did, remembering my daughter's birth.

52
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:26,238
Thanks... Honey, where's my wallet?

53
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,537
You packed the damn bag!

54
00:05:28,868 --> 00:05:30,968
Take another look, it must be there.

55
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:35,538
Sorry but I left my wallet behind.
Tomorrow, I promise...

56
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,421
You know how many times I heard that?

57
00:05:37,418 --> 00:05:40,215
I could've bought a house with all that taxi fare!

58
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,384
No, I promise...

59
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,093
There she goes again!

60
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,553
It's coming!

61
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:45,928
Hold on just a second!

62
00:05:46,504 --> 00:05:48,849
Here's my business card.

63
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,351
Call me tomorrow, I'll pay double! So sorry!

64
00:05:52,888 --> 00:05:55,080
Pay me double instead?

65
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:58,066
Best of luck in there, okay?

66
00:05:58,328 --> 00:05:59,398
Best of luck!

67
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,234
This is no place to play soccer.
Go play over there!

68
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,800
Did she go out?

69
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,599
Hey princess, sleeping already?

70
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,437
You should eat dinner.

71
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,357
Huh?

72
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,948
Who did this to you?

73
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,658
I fell down.

74
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,828
Sang-gu, that brat!

75
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:35,831
It wasn't Sang-gu! I really fell.

76
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,041
Are you gonna lie to your dad?

77
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,961
Eun-jung! Should I hit you instead?

78
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,216
Ma'am! Sang-gu!!

79
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:53,515
Ah, just the person I wanted to see.

80
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:57,144
What do you say about this?

81
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,939
How could she do this to our precious son?

82
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,774
But she also has...

83
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:06,278
Really, I've never seen
a girl as wild as Eun-jung!

84
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,364
You're too soft on her 'cause her mother died!

85
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:12,200
That's a bit...

86
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,286
And since you're here, one more thing!

87
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,289
I've held my tongue because I know your situation.

88
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:21,084
But you owe me 100,000 won in rent!

89
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:24,129
I'm sorry. Ma'am, I'll...

90
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:27,758
You're 4 months late,
at least tell us when you'll pay!

91
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,927
100,000 won is a lot of money for us too.

92
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:35,349
Sang-gu, you're sleepy! Must have eaten too much.

93
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:41,146
I don't care what my husband says,
I've had it this time.

94
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:48,445
And discipline your daughter, will you?

95
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:51,073
Breaks my heart to see my son like this.

96
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,716
Oh, I'm hungry!

97
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:11,843
Bean sprout soup?

98
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:17,099
Hey, don't fold the backs of your shoes.

99
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,643
Not answering again.

100
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:23,897
Those shoes are too small. Dinner's ready.

101
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:27,526
Then ask me to buy you new ones!

102
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,871
Wow, tastes great.

103
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:43,125
You could get married tomorrow!

104
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,836
Sang-gu's mom brought that over.

105
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:50,590
Right, I thought it was too salty.

106
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,730
Lift your head.

107
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,158
Dad, do we have to move?

108
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:19,411
Yup, we're gonna buy Sang-gu's house.
After I get rich.

109
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,705
So don't worry and study hard.

110
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,122
Okay?

111
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,467
Ouch, it stings.

112
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:36,178
Then why don't you listen?

113
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:40,223
What did I say? Play nice with him, don't fight.

114
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:42,684
But he started it!

115
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:44,060
Just ignore him.

116
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:49,149
Learn to bear it. Life is never going to be fair.

117
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:56,364
Want to go on a picnic this Wednesday?

118
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,075
No school on Buddha's Birthday.

119
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:03,788
You should work. More customers on holidays.

120
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:08,251
Oh my, you're even worse than your mother.

121
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:13,298
Who do you take after, to be so sweet!

122
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:22,682
Under the emergency decree starting on May 18,

123
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:26,770
martial law is in force,
all political activity is banned,

124
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,898
the nation's universities are temporarily closed,

125
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:33,026
and labor strikes are strictly forbidden.

126
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:36,863
The recent street demonstrations by students...

127
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:40,867
So does this mean I'll lose passengers again?

128
00:11:44,656 --> 00:11:48,584
(May 19, 1980 Press Center, Tokyo)

129
00:12:16,077 --> 00:12:17,328
Beer and sushi again?

130
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:19,664
Hey Peter, how was the parliament today?

131
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,836
Same as always, nothing different.

132
00:12:25,461 --> 00:12:29,048
This is JÃ¼rgen Hinzpeter from ARD-nDR, Germany.

133
00:12:29,465 --> 00:12:31,467
He's been living in Japan for about 8 years.

134
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:33,219
It might be helpful to know him.

135
00:12:33,261 --> 00:12:36,556
It's good to meet you,
Mr. Hinzpeter. David John, BBC.

136
00:12:37,807 --> 00:12:39,142
Just call me Peter.

137
00:12:39,138 --> 00:12:42,478
It's my first time in Japan.
Anything I should look out for?

138
00:12:44,147 --> 00:12:45,356
It's comfortable.

139
00:12:47,191 --> 00:12:48,818
That's tricky... as a journalist,

140
00:12:48,818 --> 00:12:51,112
you shouldn't be in a place that's too comfortable.

141
00:12:51,112 --> 00:12:52,196
Excuse me?

142
00:12:52,989 --> 00:12:56,117
Nothing. Where were you based before?

143
00:12:56,618 --> 00:12:59,621
South Korea. It's very tense over there now.

144
00:12:59,621 --> 00:13:03,416
I heard their government declared martial law.

145
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,792
It's always tense there.

146
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,170
I think it's much worse this time.

147
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:10,048
On top of the martial law,
several opposition leaders were arrested,

148
00:13:10,048 --> 00:13:12,300
and the universities got locked down too.

149
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,718
What else have you heard?

150
00:13:14,135 --> 00:13:15,929
I've been trying to contact some people I know,

151
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:18,264
but it's... it's almost impossible to get through.

152
00:13:19,474 --> 00:13:20,558
Since when?

153
00:13:20,808 --> 00:13:22,060
Since last night.

154
00:13:34,572 --> 00:13:36,950
(Seoul, Korea)

155
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,876
I work for the Church.

156
00:13:48,086 --> 00:13:49,128
I'm a missionary.

157
00:14:21,452 --> 00:14:22,662
It's been a long time.

158
00:14:25,206 --> 00:14:28,876
I need to get back soon. Something doesn't feel right.

159
00:14:28,876 --> 00:14:30,461
How bad is the situation?

160
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:33,339
It's been 3 days since the martial law.

161
00:14:33,756 --> 00:14:35,508
Kim Dae-jung has been taken in,

162
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,386
and they've got Kim Young-sam under house arrest.

163
00:14:50,648 --> 00:14:51,858
Gwang-ju?

164
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:53,526
It's a city down south.

165
00:14:56,821 --> 00:15:00,533
And there's no article about Gwang-ju?
No coverage, nothing?

166
00:15:08,332 --> 00:15:10,668
This is the local paper from Gwang-ju.

167
00:15:13,254 --> 00:15:14,839
They censored the whole page?

168
00:15:16,632 --> 00:15:18,426
What exactly happened over there?

169
00:15:18,426 --> 00:15:19,635
No one knows.

170
00:15:19,969 --> 00:15:23,306
We got word of the first casualty
at 3 AM on the 19th...

171
00:15:23,306 --> 00:15:24,724
But now,

172
00:15:25,516 --> 00:15:27,351
even the phone lines have been cut.

173
00:15:27,935 --> 00:15:29,604
What about the foreign press?

174
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,524
Today is Kim Jae-kyu's trial. They all went there.

175
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,152
But the government has eyes on them.

176
00:15:36,152 --> 00:15:38,404
They can't move as they wish.

177
00:15:39,947 --> 00:15:41,324
You must be careful.

178
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:47,747
I should go to Gwang-ju, first...

179
00:15:48,372 --> 00:15:49,582
By yourself?

180
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:54,879
But how will you get there?

181
00:16:00,384 --> 00:16:02,845
For a guy so paranoid about his car,

182
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:05,014
how'd you break a mirror?

183
00:16:05,014 --> 00:16:08,976
A worthless punk. He ran off after busting my car.

184
00:16:08,976 --> 00:16:11,229
Why be a student if you can't be
a decent human being?

185
00:16:11,229 --> 00:16:13,397
All right. I'll only charge 5,000 won, okay?

186
00:16:13,397 --> 00:16:16,442
What? Just take 4,000. I've had a rough day.

187
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:20,154
Have a heart, man! How can you be so cheap?

188
00:16:20,696 --> 00:16:24,367
And get an inspection sometime.
The engine doesn't sound right.

189
00:16:24,367 --> 00:16:26,869
An inspection? I inspect my car every day.

190
00:16:26,869 --> 00:16:29,664
After 600,000 km, this car is past retirement.

191
00:16:29,664 --> 00:16:31,290
Easy on my car!

192
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,793
Try fixing it after it breaks, it'll cost you more.

193
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:36,921
Don't give me bad luck! I'm already pissed.

194
00:16:36,921 --> 00:16:37,964
3,000 won, then.

195
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:40,883
That is so unfair! You know how much parts cost?

196
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,637
- Throw this out?
- No way. I'll use it later.

197
00:16:45,429 --> 00:16:47,429
Leave it.

198
00:16:47,765 --> 00:16:49,308
Dammit!

199
00:17:01,362 --> 00:17:02,613
Hey, what're you doing?

200
00:17:05,908 --> 00:17:08,369
God, you're pathetic.

201
00:17:09,412 --> 00:17:10,496
Pathetic?

202
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,293
So, the kids fought again?

203
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:18,504
I gave Sang-gu a good scolding.

204
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,215
Ma'am! Over here!

205
00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:22,967
- What?
- Another portion for us.

206
00:17:22,967 --> 00:17:25,178
No, I'm fine. Never mind!

207
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:26,804
Why not? I said I'd pay.

208
00:17:26,804 --> 00:17:28,681
Don't be silly, I'll pay.

209
00:17:28,764 --> 00:17:29,932
What's the occasion?

210
00:17:30,308 --> 00:17:31,851
Instead, lend me some money.

211
00:17:32,894 --> 00:17:34,687
I figured. How much?

212
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:37,815
100,000 won. From you private stash.

213
00:17:37,815 --> 00:17:42,778
Hey! I gave it all to my sister
As a secret wedding gift.

214
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:46,032
But why so much? You paid off all your debts.

215
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:50,411
It's not the rent, is it?

216
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:51,787
Bingo!

217
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,664
My god.

218
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:57,793
Only you would borrow
from your landlord to pay the rent.

219
00:18:00,796 --> 00:18:02,506
Lend it to me before you start saying things.

220
00:18:04,634 --> 00:18:07,303
Ma'am! Give me anything quick!

221
00:18:07,803 --> 00:18:09,222
What's the rush?

222
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,265
We need to play cards after lunch.

223
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:15,519
You guys play all you like.
I'm going to Kukdo Theater.

224
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:17,396
- Got a long distance.
- Where to?

225
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:20,942
Gwang-ju. We'll go now, and be back before curfew.

226
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:24,445
Wow, you hit the jackpot. For how much?

227
00:18:25,154 --> 00:18:27,154
100,000 won.

228
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:27,448
100,000 won?

229
00:18:27,865 --> 00:18:30,534
What kind of idiot would pay 100,000 for one day?

230
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:31,994
A foreigner idiot.

231
00:18:31,994 --> 00:18:33,537
Oh, do you speak English?

232
00:18:33,663 --> 00:18:37,291
Of course. I grew up near the U.S. army base.

233
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:40,294
Damn, and foreigners pay tips! If you add the tip...

234
00:18:41,379 --> 00:18:44,590
You spent time abroad. Couldn't you handle that?

235
00:19:01,899 --> 00:19:04,402
I'm sorry! Enjoy your lunch.

236
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,201
Ma'am, discipline Sang-gu, will you?
Who does he take after?

237
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,079
And he eats too much. Takes after his mom?

238
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:20,459
Wait till I get that money!
I'll teach that kid some manners!

239
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,354
Called for a taxi?

240
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:46,610
Yes, but isn't this a private taxi?
I called a taxi company.

241
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:52,116
Ah yes, but the company's cars are all busy.

242
00:19:52,116 --> 00:19:53,784
So I volunteered...

243
00:19:54,035 --> 00:19:55,494
Does he understand what's going on?

244
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,621
Of course. I explained everything.

245
00:19:58,622 --> 00:20:00,041
You were told everything?

246
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:04,378
Yes, to Gwang-ju and back
before curfew for 100,000 won.

247
00:20:04,628 --> 00:20:06,088
And you speak English?

248
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,299
Of course, of course!

249
00:20:08,424 --> 00:20:11,927
Sure, I spent 5 years in Saudi Arabia,
so I speak English.

250
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,805
Don't worry, don't worry! I'm Mr. Kim!

251
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:19,185
Together, let's go Gwang-ju.

252
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:21,687
Okay, nice to meet you!

253
00:20:22,396 --> 00:20:23,731
Please get in.

254
00:20:23,814 --> 00:20:24,899
Ok, okay.

255
00:20:30,488 --> 00:20:31,489
Thank you.

256
00:20:31,739 --> 00:20:32,740
Be careful.

257
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:50,925
Take another taxi. This one's reserved.

258
00:20:50,925 --> 00:20:53,177
Reserved? For where?

259
00:20:53,177 --> 00:20:54,178
Why?

260
00:20:54,637 --> 00:20:56,222
This car's going to Gwang-ju.

261
00:21:06,857 --> 00:21:08,317
You Korea first time?

262
00:21:10,861 --> 00:21:12,321
No. it's my second time.

263
00:21:12,321 --> 00:21:13,489
Oh really?

264
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:20,037
You are where from?

265
00:21:20,955 --> 00:21:21,997
Germany.

266
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:24,834
Germany, oh really?

267
00:21:25,626 --> 00:21:27,503
My friend...

268
00:21:27,503 --> 00:21:29,547
What's the word for that?

269
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:31,757
He went to mine coal.

270
00:21:33,134 --> 00:21:35,761
I know, there are many Korean workers in Germany.

271
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:38,055
Nurses, miners.

272
00:21:38,222 --> 00:21:39,598
I was in Saudi, you know?

273
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:43,561
Do you know Saudi? This taxi, Saudi money.

274
00:21:44,061 --> 00:21:45,521
I drive Saudi truck.

275
00:21:45,521 --> 00:21:49,024
Driving in that desert, shit!

276
00:21:49,024 --> 00:21:51,193
People here don't have a damned clue!

277
00:21:51,861 --> 00:21:54,738
Listen, how far is it to Gwang-ju?

278
00:21:54,738 --> 00:21:56,782
I don't have much time, I need to go there quick.

279
00:21:57,076 --> 00:21:58,948
Why is he talking so fast?

280
00:22:00,327 --> 00:22:03,456
You, fast. Huh? Slow...

281
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:06,417
So that I can English.

282
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,210
Slow, okay?

283
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:12,756
Okay. Gwang-ju, we go fast. Okay? Fast!

284
00:22:12,882 --> 00:22:14,508
What's the hurry?

285
00:22:14,758 --> 00:22:16,260
Gwang-ju, don't worry! Don't worry!

286
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,636
I'm best driver.

287
00:22:17,887 --> 00:22:20,473
It's really far. Get some sleep.

288
00:22:20,681 --> 00:22:22,808
Sleep... sleep.

289
00:22:24,226 --> 00:22:25,603
You darling, you!

290
00:22:25,603 --> 00:22:28,105
My recent luck's been shit all for this day.

291
00:23:32,002 --> 00:23:34,338
Hey hey, Gwang-ju! Gwang-ju!

292
00:23:34,338 --> 00:23:35,923
Gwang-ju? Are we here?

293
00:23:50,771 --> 00:23:52,898
What's this? Can we go?

294
00:23:55,484 --> 00:23:57,027
Don't slow down, keep going!

295
00:23:58,696 --> 00:23:59,947
Uh, yes yes.

296
00:23:59,947 --> 00:24:01,156
What's he shooting?

297
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,576
What picture, what camera?

298
00:24:03,576 --> 00:24:04,660
Let's go, hurry!

299
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:10,082
Why so rude? If I ask you something, answer.

300
00:24:10,374 --> 00:24:14,295
And what's with this road? Can I pass, or not?

301
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,985
What's this?

302
00:24:38,652 --> 00:24:40,529
I'm not a reporter, you understand?

303
00:24:40,654 --> 00:24:42,531
Huh? What?

304
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:44,408
I said to speak slow!

305
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,329
Are they training?

306
00:24:55,252 --> 00:24:56,295
Stop!

307
00:24:58,631 --> 00:25:00,090
Is this a training exercise?

308
00:25:00,215 --> 00:25:01,508
What division?

309
00:25:01,508 --> 00:25:04,053
I did my service in the 7th division.

310
00:25:04,053 --> 00:25:06,138
This is a real operation. Turn back.

311
00:25:08,307 --> 00:25:09,767
Didn't you see the sign?

312
00:25:11,935 --> 00:25:13,729
My passenger's going to Gwang-ju.

313
00:25:13,729 --> 00:25:15,481
You idiot, are you trying to die?

314
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,610
Who the hell are you?

315
00:25:20,653 --> 00:25:21,862
What is he saying?

316
00:25:22,946 --> 00:25:24,239
Is he asking me something?

317
00:25:24,365 --> 00:25:25,532
What did he just say?

318
00:25:28,369 --> 00:25:30,412
He said, let's go back. He made a mistake.

319
00:25:31,121 --> 00:25:33,121
Allegiance!

320
00:25:45,761 --> 00:25:50,307
Excuse me, Driver. This direction, also Gwang-ju?

321
00:25:54,895 --> 00:25:57,648
No no Gwang-ju. Now, we go Seoul.

322
00:25:57,981 --> 00:25:59,981
Seoul?

323
00:25:59,775 --> 00:26:02,653
What are you talking about?
I have to go to Gwang-ju.

324
00:26:03,153 --> 00:26:05,614
That's what you think, and it's not that I refuse.

325
00:26:05,823 --> 00:26:07,991
Soldier say, Gwang-ju no!

326
00:26:08,992 --> 00:26:13,122
Okay, you won't get paid
if you don't take me to Gwang-ju.

327
00:26:13,914 --> 00:26:14,915
You understand?

328
00:26:15,666 --> 00:26:17,501
What's he saying?

329
00:26:17,918 --> 00:26:20,129
No Gwang-ju, no money.

330
00:26:20,129 --> 00:26:21,130
No money?

331
00:26:22,631 --> 00:26:26,510
Are you joking? You know how much gas we used?

332
00:26:27,469 --> 00:26:29,012
Soldier say no Gwang-ju!

333
00:26:29,012 --> 00:26:30,681
We can't go there!

334
00:26:30,848 --> 00:26:32,848
No Gwang-ju!

335
00:26:32,975 --> 00:26:35,894
You what camera picture?

336
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,396
Why you Gwang-ju?

337
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:39,396
Oh my god.

338
00:26:38,768 --> 00:26:40,878
You know what, just take me to Gwang-ju.

339
00:26:40,884 --> 00:26:42,648
That's all you should worry
about what I'm doing there.

340
00:26:42,651 --> 00:26:44,069
It's none of your business, okay?

341
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,823
Business?

342
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,493
You businessman?

343
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,786
So you go to Gwang-ju?

344
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:57,124
Yes, Gwang-ju.

345
00:26:57,875 --> 00:26:59,585
No Gwang-ju no money.

346
00:27:00,794 --> 00:27:03,797
Shit, am I just going to waste gas money?

347
00:27:17,853 --> 00:27:18,979
Sir!

348
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:21,732
Let me ask you something.

349
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:26,737
Is there any back road to Gwang-ju around here?

350
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:28,238
Nope.

351
00:27:30,574 --> 00:27:33,368
Then, is there anyone who'd know...

352
00:27:33,368 --> 00:27:35,454
What do you want there?

353
00:27:35,829 --> 00:27:38,540
Didn't you see the soldiers?

354
00:27:39,416 --> 00:27:42,044
You'd be better off heading back home.

355
00:27:43,378 --> 00:27:45,964
Sir, if I can't get to Gwang-ju...

356
00:27:47,424 --> 00:27:50,969
Sir, I really need to go there!

357
00:27:51,386 --> 00:27:57,643
Our village foreman told us
to stay clear of Gwang-ju.

358
00:28:03,732 --> 00:28:08,779
Over that there hill, there is one back road...

359
00:28:08,779 --> 00:28:10,197
Where is it?

360
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:12,199
Over there...

361
00:28:12,783 --> 00:28:14,451
Over that side...

362
00:28:23,293 --> 00:28:25,963
This road's gonna ruin my shocks.

363
00:28:27,798 --> 00:28:30,217
You're lucky to have me, you know?

364
00:28:30,217 --> 00:28:33,303
Any other driver would be back in Seoul by now.

365
00:28:35,222 --> 00:28:37,474
Here, no soldier!

366
00:28:40,143 --> 00:28:42,104
Yeah, great. No soldier.

367
00:28:50,487 --> 00:28:53,699
What's going on, for them to block even this road?

368
00:28:55,576 --> 00:28:58,036
Stop! Who the hell...

369
00:28:58,412 --> 00:28:59,413
Turn back.

370
00:28:59,413 --> 00:29:02,040
I'm just trying to earn some money...

371
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:05,544
You said you're a businessman?

372
00:29:05,752 --> 00:29:07,170
Dollars, contract.

373
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:08,297
Contract...

374
00:29:10,841 --> 00:29:11,925
Something like this.

375
00:29:12,092 --> 00:29:13,635
Very very important paper!

376
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,930
You forgot this, okay? In Gwang-ju.

377
00:29:17,806 --> 00:29:19,806
What?

378
00:29:20,517 --> 00:29:22,394
Good day, sir! Allegiance!

379
00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:24,394
Yes.

380
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:25,314
I'm coming from Gimpo Airport.

381
00:29:25,647 --> 00:29:28,066
That guy is a really important businessman.

382
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:32,237
He had to miss his plane to U.S.,
and return for important papers.

383
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:33,906
No. Turn back!

384
00:29:33,906 --> 00:29:35,073
Please listen.

385
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:38,827
Without those papers, we can't export to the U.S.

386
00:29:38,827 --> 00:29:42,122
I came speeding here from the airport
all out of patriotism!

387
00:29:42,122 --> 00:29:45,208
We need to export so we can like,
get dollars! Yeah?

388
00:29:45,208 --> 00:29:47,085
- What's wrong?
- To become a developed country...

389
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:48,211
Hold on a sec.

390
00:29:48,211 --> 00:29:50,211
Listen!

391
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:54,092
If I don't get to Gwang-ju there
will be problems, big problems!

392
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:56,178
My boss is a very important man.

393
00:29:56,178 --> 00:29:59,473
He'll be very unhappy if I don't
get back with those documents.

394
00:29:59,473 --> 00:30:01,308
Very very unhappy! Tell him.

395
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:04,811
What did he say?

396
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:07,648
You said a hugely important...?

397
00:30:07,648 --> 00:30:09,149
Tell him, not me.

398
00:30:09,232 --> 00:30:11,151
Very very important paper, okay?

399
00:30:11,234 --> 00:30:12,527
Very important paper.

400
00:30:12,527 --> 00:30:16,239
Important man, important paper. Big, big trouble!

401
00:30:27,542 --> 00:30:29,336
Hey, clear a path.

402
00:30:30,754 --> 00:30:32,089
But come right back.

403
00:30:32,089 --> 00:30:34,216
It's dangerous there because of the rioters.

404
00:30:34,758 --> 00:30:36,385
- Rioters?
- Yes.

405
00:30:37,678 --> 00:30:40,263
Yes, we'll be back in a flash.

406
00:30:40,263 --> 00:30:41,556
- Allegiance!
- Yes.

407
00:31:01,034 --> 00:31:03,286
Nice job back there!

408
00:31:03,704 --> 00:31:04,913
My fare.

409
00:31:05,706 --> 00:31:07,749
100,000 won now.

410
00:31:09,459 --> 00:31:12,212
I've told you,
I'll pay you once we get back to Seoul.

411
00:31:12,212 --> 00:31:13,588
Gwang-ju dangerous.

412
00:31:13,588 --> 00:31:14,715
So pay in advance.

413
00:31:14,756 --> 00:31:15,757
First money.

414
00:31:17,217 --> 00:31:18,885
No, it's "Ladies first," so...

415
00:31:19,219 --> 00:31:20,262
Money first.

416
00:31:20,762 --> 00:31:22,305
Korea business style.

417
00:31:22,848 --> 00:31:24,683
Now no money, I go Seoul.

418
00:31:25,142 --> 00:31:26,143
Your choice.

419
00:31:27,853 --> 00:31:30,564
Go ahead and glare at me, you jerk.

420
00:31:30,939 --> 00:31:32,399
Your choice!

421
00:31:45,328 --> 00:31:46,705
You'll get the rest in Seoul.

422
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:48,331
Your choice!

423
00:31:50,584 --> 00:31:53,420
What a fox. Are you copying me?

424
00:31:55,756 --> 00:31:57,215
Still, 50,000 is nice.

425
00:31:57,299 --> 00:31:59,885
I choice! Let's go Gwang-ju, okay?

426
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:02,054
Alrighty!

427
00:32:02,554 --> 00:32:04,389
What a miser.

428
00:32:05,515 --> 00:32:08,310
Glare at me like that and I'll rip your eyes out.

429
00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:12,355
You don't know what I'm saying, do you?

430
00:32:14,441 --> 00:32:15,817
Let's go Gwang-ju

431
00:32:15,817 --> 00:32:17,277
That's all I said.

432
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,657
(To the citizens of democratic Gwang-ju...)

433
00:32:34,544 --> 00:32:37,130
(Defend Democracy to the Death!)

434
00:32:37,547 --> 00:32:39,341
What's going on here?

435
00:32:39,341 --> 00:32:41,635
(Rescind martial law!)

436
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:45,639
Stop the car, Driver. What does that mean?

437
00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:46,932
Huh? What?

438
00:32:47,224 --> 00:32:49,976
(To the 1980s, Decade of Hope!)

439
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,645
It says...

440
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,564
Hope, hope. Eight.

441
00:32:54,564 --> 00:32:57,526
Ah, 80, 80. Hope.

442
00:32:57,526 --> 00:32:58,693
Hope?

443
00:32:58,693 --> 00:32:59,945
In the 1980s...

444
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,657
Oh, it's just some crap. Forget about it.

445
00:33:07,786 --> 00:33:08,912
What's that?

446
00:33:10,413 --> 00:33:12,082
Wait, stop! Pull over.

447
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:15,585
Hey look, it's a Seoul taxi.

448
00:33:18,421 --> 00:33:20,298
Whoa, it's a foreigner.

449
00:33:21,049 --> 00:33:22,801
Hi. Where are you going?

450
00:33:22,926 --> 00:33:24,052
- What's he saying?
- Well...

451
00:33:24,052 --> 00:33:25,387
Isn't that a camera?

452
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:30,350
Those university students
speak worse English than me.

453
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:34,062
Hey, Jae-sik! You speak some English, right?

454
00:33:35,188 --> 00:33:37,440
Get over here, Jae-sik.

455
00:33:38,191 --> 00:33:39,651
Why me?

456
00:33:41,361 --> 00:33:43,361
Hi.

457
00:33:42,821 --> 00:33:44,821
Hi.

458
00:33:43,738 --> 00:33:44,906
Where are you going?

459
00:33:47,993 --> 00:33:49,077
Where are you from?

460
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:52,914
Germany. German broadcast, ARD.

461
00:33:52,956 --> 00:33:58,545
German. Um.. Are you a reporter?

462
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:01,047
Yes. I am a reporter.

463
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:06,303
He's a reporter from Germany, come to shoot us.

464
00:34:10,307 --> 00:34:13,310
We'll be on the news. Great!

465
00:34:13,727 --> 00:34:15,812
Businessman, my ass.

466
00:34:15,979 --> 00:34:17,439
If you're a reporter, you should've told me!

467
00:34:17,439 --> 00:34:19,357
He rode here in a taxi from Seoul!

468
00:34:19,691 --> 00:34:22,569
Let's give a hand to the
taxi driver who came so far!

469
00:34:25,906 --> 00:34:27,407
Ah well, from Seoul to here...

470
00:34:27,407 --> 00:34:28,700
Where are you headed now?

471
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,743
...is pretty far.

472
00:34:31,244 --> 00:34:33,705
We go to the hospital for the sick.

473
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,374
Can I come with you?

474
00:34:37,292 --> 00:34:39,292
Yes.

475
00:34:38,001 --> 00:34:39,252
I'd like to interview him.

476
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:43,506
He wants to interview you.

477
00:34:44,007 --> 00:34:45,800
Wow, you're a star now!

478
00:34:45,884 --> 00:34:49,054
Ah, I should've at least washed my face.

479
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:58,730
You come up too, Mister.

480
00:34:59,648 --> 00:35:00,815
What do you mean?

481
00:35:00,815 --> 00:35:02,525
He needs to drive his taxi.

482
00:35:03,109 --> 00:35:04,444
Don't worry, don't worry.

483
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:07,197
I'll be right behind you.

484
00:35:08,114 --> 00:35:09,157
Me too go!

485
00:35:09,824 --> 00:35:11,159
Then follow us!

486
00:35:12,619 --> 00:35:13,995
Let's go!

487
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:25,840
We fight for justice, hoorah hoorah!

488
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,677
Live and die together, hoorah hoorah!

489
00:35:28,677 --> 00:35:31,721
We'd rather die standing than live on our knees!

490
00:35:31,721 --> 00:35:34,224
We fight for justice!

491
00:35:34,224 --> 00:35:37,811
I should've known 100,000 won
was too good to be true.

492
00:35:38,478 --> 00:35:41,523
Citizens of Gwang-ju, unite!

493
00:35:41,856 --> 00:35:45,360
Citizens of Gwang-ju, citizens of Gwang-ju,

494
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,446
Citizens of Gwang-ju, unite!

495
00:35:59,416 --> 00:36:03,086
Can't risk my car getting damaged
in the protest again.

496
00:36:07,132 --> 00:36:08,591
Oh my, taxi!

497
00:36:08,591 --> 00:36:11,428
Give me a lift, mister!

498
00:36:11,594 --> 00:36:14,889
Take a Gwang-ju taxi, granny.
This is a Seoul taxi.

499
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,728
Oh jeez.

500
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:30,447
Granny, can you even pay the fare?

501
00:36:34,034 --> 00:36:35,535
Who's in the hospital?

502
00:36:35,535 --> 00:36:38,747
They said someone who looks
like my youngest son

503
00:36:39,706 --> 00:36:43,585
was brought there after
a soldier smashed his head.

504
00:36:44,002 --> 00:36:47,088
Is he a university student? Does he protest?

505
00:36:47,172 --> 00:36:50,216
He didn't even go to high school.

506
00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:54,596
Didn't come home last night.

507
00:36:55,347 --> 00:36:59,559
Then he must have been out
drinking with his friends!

508
00:36:59,893 --> 00:37:02,228
He can't drink.

509
00:37:02,645 --> 00:37:08,151
And those soldiers, they've gone berserk,

510
00:37:08,151 --> 00:37:14,199
beating and stabbing anyone who passes by.

511
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:19,746
Granny, I was an army sergeant.
No soldier would ever do that.

512
00:37:20,372 --> 00:37:22,791
Those are all just rumors, right?

513
00:37:22,791 --> 00:37:24,000
Of course...

514
00:37:25,168 --> 00:37:30,715
Then where the heck did he go?

515
00:37:48,983 --> 00:37:51,027
No, I won't take you!

516
00:37:51,027 --> 00:37:53,530
Go see if they need help.

517
00:37:54,864 --> 00:37:56,658
Please drive. I have to rush.

518
00:37:56,658 --> 00:37:58,201
What's your hurry?

519
00:37:58,701 --> 00:38:01,454
You don't write a single line in the newspaper!

520
00:38:01,704 --> 00:38:04,791
You reporters have more time than anyone now!

521
00:38:04,999 --> 00:38:08,503
If reporters don't report, why should we drive?

522
00:38:08,503 --> 00:38:12,590
Gwang-ju taxi drivers must be rich,
turning down fares like that.

523
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,510
Ma'am.

524
00:38:16,386 --> 00:38:18,763
Please give me a ride.

525
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:19,889
No way.

526
00:38:20,014 --> 00:38:21,099
Damn it!

527
00:38:22,016 --> 00:38:23,268
Taxi, taxi!

528
00:38:23,268 --> 00:38:26,104
No, this is a Seoul taxi. Take a Gwang-ju taxi.

529
00:38:32,527 --> 00:38:34,527
Go to the other side!

530
00:38:33,486 --> 00:38:34,529
Oh my.

531
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,698
What a mess.

532
00:38:36,698 --> 00:38:37,866
A high school student?

533
00:38:37,866 --> 00:38:39,200
Careful!

534
00:38:39,826 --> 00:38:41,703
Go call a doctor!

535
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,038
Doctor!

536
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:45,373
Doctor!

537
00:38:45,748 --> 00:38:51,212
Please find my youngest son. I beg you, please...

538
00:38:52,964 --> 00:38:55,049
Where are you, Yong-pyo?

539
00:39:10,482 --> 00:39:13,943
Oh, Yong-pyo! My son...

540
00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:20,156
Are you okay?

541
00:39:19,032 --> 00:39:21,032
Mom?

542
00:39:21,242 --> 00:39:22,619
Mom!

543
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:23,786
Yong-pyo!

544
00:39:23,786 --> 00:39:25,371
What are you doin' here?

545
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:28,082
Oh, you wicked boy!

546
00:39:29,083 --> 00:39:31,794
I thought something awful happened to you.

547
00:39:32,795 --> 00:39:35,632
Are you okay?

548
00:39:35,632 --> 00:39:39,135
This ain't nothin' at all. Just three stitches.

549
00:39:39,594 --> 00:39:41,179
Are you hurt anywhere else?

550
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:43,431
I'm totally fine.

551
00:39:46,434 --> 00:39:49,729
- Sir, thank you so much!
- Oh...

552
00:39:49,729 --> 00:39:51,231
Thank you, really.

553
00:39:51,231 --> 00:39:52,524
Mom, wear this.

554
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:56,903
Don't know what I'd have done
without this taxi driver.

555
00:39:56,903 --> 00:39:58,029
Thank you so much.

556
00:39:59,405 --> 00:40:00,949
You got some money?

557
00:40:01,491 --> 00:40:02,825
I ain't got money.

558
00:40:02,951 --> 00:40:05,537
Never mind, you don't need to pay me.

559
00:40:05,912 --> 00:40:07,872
See, I told you he'd be fine!

560
00:40:07,914 --> 00:40:10,875
Wait! Are you that Seoul taxi...

561
00:40:12,126 --> 00:40:13,378
You know me?

562
00:40:13,378 --> 00:40:14,462
It's you!

563
00:40:15,338 --> 00:40:18,383
Yong-pyo, you know him?

564
00:40:18,383 --> 00:40:20,218
- A while back, this guy...
- Hey mister!

565
00:40:23,471 --> 00:40:24,556
What's he doing here?

566
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:26,766
Do you have any idea how much time
I wasted looking for you?

567
00:40:26,975 --> 00:40:29,269
We've been driving all over trying to find you!

568
00:40:29,269 --> 00:40:30,603
Where is my film bag?

569
00:40:30,687 --> 00:40:34,274
Who is he to yell at my driver!

570
00:40:35,108 --> 00:40:38,027
He ran off with this reporter's expensive equipment.

571
00:40:39,279 --> 00:40:40,655
What are you talking about?

572
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:42,323
How dare you!

573
00:40:42,323 --> 00:40:45,243
I took what? I didn't take anything!

574
00:40:46,661 --> 00:40:48,661
What's going on?

575
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:49,579
His...

576
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:50,331
Look here!

577
00:40:54,335 --> 00:40:55,503
What's this doing here?

578
00:40:58,881 --> 00:41:00,881
I don't know.

579
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:01,467
I really didn't know.

580
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,262
You said to follow, and then you sped off.

581
00:41:04,804 --> 00:41:08,808
I don't know the roads here.
You know how hard I searched?

582
00:41:08,808 --> 00:41:11,060
Hey mister, that ain't so.

583
00:41:11,811 --> 00:41:13,855
People saw you take a U-turn.

584
00:41:13,855 --> 00:41:15,732
Hey, Yong-pyo! Watch it.

585
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:19,444
Would he really take off
without collecting his fare?

586
00:41:19,485 --> 00:41:22,822
Here, the other half of the fare.

587
00:41:22,822 --> 00:41:25,408
So you just go back to Seoul.
I'm better off on my own.

588
00:41:25,617 --> 00:41:29,120
What? He charged 50,000 won just to come here?

589
00:41:30,371 --> 00:41:34,125
Actually, they agreed on 100,000,
and he already received half.

590
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:35,501
100,000 won?

591
00:41:36,628 --> 00:41:38,838
What? So he got paid and tried to run off?

592
00:41:40,882 --> 00:41:42,091
Take this and go!

593
00:41:43,051 --> 00:41:45,051
Just take it.

594
00:41:45,637 --> 00:41:47,680
Why are you giving this guy money?

595
00:41:48,348 --> 00:41:50,350
He's giving us all a bad name.

596
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:55,104
Taxi drivers like this need to be taught a lesson!

597
00:41:55,396 --> 00:41:58,399
Whose side are you guys on, anyway?

598
00:41:58,399 --> 00:42:00,234
How dare you start shouting!

599
00:42:01,027 --> 00:42:03,363
Bro, am I wrong?

600
00:42:04,113 --> 00:42:05,823
Why don't you say something?

601
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:07,158
What would I say?

602
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,663
If he received his fare...

603
00:42:12,163 --> 00:42:14,874
would he really just ditch his passenger?

604
00:42:15,416 --> 00:42:18,586
Man, you're so wishy-washy.

605
00:42:18,961 --> 00:42:20,546
I'm not wishy-washy.

606
00:42:21,047 --> 00:42:23,841
I'm firm when I need to be. Don't you know me?

607
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:27,470
Hey, Seoul Driver! You'll pay for doing that.

608
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,724
As a driver it's wrong,
and as a human being it's wrong!

609
00:42:31,724 --> 00:42:34,936
How dare you talk to me that way!

610
00:42:37,522 --> 00:42:40,608
I guess everything they said about you was true!

611
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,111
Let me take a look at your license number.

612
00:42:43,111 --> 00:42:45,363
What the hell are you doing?

613
00:42:48,449 --> 00:42:50,449
Here!

614
00:42:50,535 --> 00:42:53,287
I'm not receiving anything, alright?

615
00:43:10,471 --> 00:43:11,556
Let's go.

616
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:19,856
College boy! Are you gonna
ride around in my car all day?

617
00:43:21,858 --> 00:43:24,068
He asked me to translate...

618
00:43:25,027 --> 00:43:27,196
Do your parents know what you're doing?

619
00:43:27,363 --> 00:43:29,449
Why are you chewing me out?

620
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:31,743
Didn't you see back there?

621
00:43:32,034 --> 00:43:34,454
Your mother must be worried sick.

622
00:43:35,288 --> 00:43:40,168
Paying that expensive tuition,
did you go to university to protest?

623
00:43:40,168 --> 00:43:43,463
You went to study, right?
Then you should study, dammit!

624
00:43:44,839 --> 00:43:46,799
I didn't go to university to study.

625
00:43:51,304 --> 00:43:52,930
I went to compete in the university song contest.

626
00:43:57,268 --> 00:44:01,773
Then why not spend this time practicing your singing?

627
00:44:02,231 --> 00:44:05,443
Mister, you don't know what you're talking about.

628
00:44:05,443 --> 00:44:09,614
You students think other countries are as nice as ours?

629
00:44:09,614 --> 00:44:11,532
Go to Saudi Arabia! In that hot, burning...

630
00:44:11,532 --> 00:44:14,702
What's so great about a country
where soldiers assault you?

631
00:44:14,702 --> 00:44:16,913
Then why do you keep protesting?

632
00:44:16,913 --> 00:44:20,666
They keep telling you to stop,
but you won't listen!

633
00:44:21,042 --> 00:44:24,754
How is it that this foreigner
understands better than you?

634
00:44:24,754 --> 00:44:25,838
Forget it.

635
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:27,507
Seven o'clock go Seoul, okay?

636
00:44:30,384 --> 00:44:32,384
Okay.

637
00:44:31,886 --> 00:44:33,638
Promise, seven o'clock!

638
00:44:35,097 --> 00:44:36,808
Is he going in the right direction?

639
00:44:37,517 --> 00:44:41,354
Yeah, don't worry. This is the right direction.

640
00:44:41,354 --> 00:44:44,190
We turn right here, and then we go more.

641
00:44:46,067 --> 00:44:48,067
There!

642
00:44:47,109 --> 00:44:48,152
Oh my god!

643
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:50,154
Mister, you missed the right turn!

644
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:51,948
Gas, gas!

645
00:44:52,031 --> 00:44:53,825
I'm going to fill the gas tank!

646
00:44:54,617 --> 00:44:55,827
Goddamn!

647
00:44:58,037 --> 00:45:00,289
Gas...

648
00:45:06,671 --> 00:45:08,089
Stop, stop.

649
00:45:09,966 --> 00:45:11,467
3,000 won's worth, but like a full tank.

650
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,762
Who do you think I am?

651
00:45:15,972 --> 00:45:18,182
I'm not that kind of person!

652
00:45:23,646 --> 00:45:25,022
What did I just say?

653
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:26,065
You're not that kind of person.

654
00:45:26,065 --> 00:45:28,067
No, I said 3,000 won.

655
00:45:28,568 --> 00:45:29,652
- Right?
- Yes.

656
00:45:30,695 --> 00:45:34,156
Stop pumping! What, are you crazy?

657
00:45:34,907 --> 00:45:37,326
- What are you doing?
- What's wrong?

658
00:45:37,326 --> 00:45:40,037
I asked for 3,000 won's worth. 3,000 won only!

659
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:41,038
What?

660
00:45:41,163 --> 00:45:43,124
You think I'm gonna pay more?

661
00:45:43,124 --> 00:45:45,543
I may be an out-of-towner, but this is outrageous!

662
00:45:45,543 --> 00:45:47,795
I'm only gonna pay 3,000 won.

663
00:45:47,795 --> 00:45:50,047
Look at this guy.

664
00:45:50,715 --> 00:45:53,217
What are you so angry about,

665
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:56,929
me giving you a bit more gas
when it's all free anyway.

666
00:45:57,179 --> 00:46:01,726
If I filled it full, you'd have me by the throat.

667
00:46:02,935 --> 00:46:03,978
Free?

668
00:46:03,978 --> 00:46:07,189
Did you think everyone in
Gwang-ju was just like you?

669
00:46:08,316 --> 00:46:09,317
Ouch!

670
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:19,660
Why didn't you say it's free?
I'd have filled the tank full.

671
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:23,789
Then fill it before you head back to Seoul.

672
00:46:23,915 --> 00:46:26,500
Of course! The gas fare to Seoul is costly.

673
00:46:27,501 --> 00:46:28,878
But why is it free?

674
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,630
You saw that taxi at the hospital?

675
00:46:30,838 --> 00:46:33,507
Taxi drivers have one helluva of a job these days.

676
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:36,302
Some were arrested
for transporting wounded people.

677
00:46:36,594 --> 00:46:40,973
What's wrong about that?
You can't choose who you take.

678
00:46:40,973 --> 00:46:42,475
That's my point.

679
00:46:42,767 --> 00:46:46,062
We didn't do anything wrong
to be suffering like this.

680
00:46:51,609 --> 00:46:54,070
(Gwang-ju citizens, to the Provincial Office!)

681
00:46:58,282 --> 00:47:00,451
(Drive out the martial law soldiers!)

682
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,287
That way, mister. Over there.

683
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:09,585
Citizens of Gwang-ju! We're all in this together!

684
00:47:09,919 --> 00:47:12,171
Drive out the soldiers!

685
00:47:12,755 --> 00:47:16,634
Drive them out and protect our city!

686
00:47:22,473 --> 00:47:26,477
Citizens of Gwang-ju! Let's all take action!

687
00:47:27,561 --> 00:47:30,439
Coming through! News reporter here!

688
00:47:30,773 --> 00:47:36,612
All the way from Seoul to report,
so please make way.

689
00:47:37,071 --> 00:47:38,280
Thank you, thanks!

690
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,824
That's a reporter!

691
00:47:40,992 --> 00:47:42,284
A foreigner?

692
00:47:42,535 --> 00:47:44,328
Thank you!

693
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:46,247
Flew all the way here?

694
00:47:49,667 --> 00:47:51,377
Make way, people!

695
00:48:00,011 --> 00:48:02,972
Best to set out on a full stomach. Have some.

696
00:48:03,139 --> 00:48:05,349
What's this? Thank you.

697
00:48:06,684 --> 00:48:08,728
- Hungry? Try one.
- Thank you.

698
00:48:08,728 --> 00:48:10,938
- Is it okay to take this?
- We already ate!

699
00:48:10,938 --> 00:48:12,565
Thanks so much!

700
00:48:12,815 --> 00:48:14,275
Thanks to you, too!

701
00:48:41,343 --> 00:48:44,638
Mister, we'll be back in no time. Why bother?

702
00:48:45,514 --> 00:48:48,184
If my car gets scratched,
are you gonna pay for it?

703
00:48:49,769 --> 00:48:50,936
Hey!

704
00:49:02,782 --> 00:49:05,993
Hello? Where are you from?

705
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,996
ARD Germany. My name is Peter.

706
00:49:09,872 --> 00:49:13,167
I'm Choi, a local reporter. How did you get here?

707
00:49:13,709 --> 00:49:16,170
I heard all the roads to Gwang-ju are blocked.

708
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:17,421
I came by taxi.

709
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,099
Live and die together, hoorah hoorah!

710
00:49:28,474 --> 00:49:32,186
We'd rather die standing than live on our knees!

711
00:49:32,186 --> 00:49:34,980
We fight for justice!

712
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:37,399
(Afternoon of May 20,
1980 Geumnam Street, Gwang-ju)

713
00:49:39,777 --> 00:49:43,364
Citizens of Gwang-ju, unite!

714
00:49:43,614 --> 00:49:47,076
Citizens of Gwang-ju, citizens of Gwang-ju,

715
00:49:47,076 --> 00:49:49,453
Citizens of Gwang-ju, unite!

716
00:49:49,453 --> 00:49:51,747
Can you hold this?

717
00:49:51,831 --> 00:49:53,207
Yeah, okay sure.

718
00:49:55,167 --> 00:49:56,544
What a jerk.

719
00:50:16,564 --> 00:50:20,609
Wow, Jeolla Province
really does have the best food.

720
00:50:21,026 --> 00:50:23,696
Looks simple, but tastes great.

721
00:50:23,988 --> 00:50:25,030
The seasoning is perfect!

722
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:26,157
Be very careful.

723
00:50:26,907 --> 00:50:31,036
The Korean press is not allowed here,
and foreign press is not welcome.

724
00:50:31,412 --> 00:50:35,166
If they find you are here,
the government will hunt you down.

725
00:50:35,916 --> 00:50:38,544
And the people helping you.

726
00:50:44,466 --> 00:50:46,468
What, you want one?

727
00:50:46,969 --> 00:50:49,430
Have a bite. Nothing happening there.

728
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:50,598
No, thank you.

729
00:50:51,056 --> 00:50:53,225
Why so serious all of a sudden?

730
00:50:53,309 --> 00:50:54,476
It's nothing.

731
00:52:00,918 --> 00:52:02,336
I have to join them.

732
00:52:02,378 --> 00:52:04,088
Don't get involved, stay here.

733
00:52:05,464 --> 00:52:07,299
How can I just watch?

734
00:52:07,466 --> 00:52:09,426
What difference will it make?

735
00:52:09,969 --> 00:52:11,512
Okay. Let's get down there.

736
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:13,347
Where? There?

737
00:52:13,347 --> 00:52:16,225
No no no, here stay. There danger.

738
00:52:16,225 --> 00:52:17,309
Here safe.

739
00:52:17,393 --> 00:52:18,602
You stay, we go down.

740
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:20,602
That guy's just shooting from up here, too.
You stay, we go down.

741
00:52:18,769 --> 00:52:20,771
That guy's just shooting from up here, too.

742
00:52:21,522 --> 00:52:22,773
Where are you going?

743
00:52:33,075 --> 00:52:34,201
What's going on?

744
00:52:40,916 --> 00:52:43,377
Drive out Chun Doo-hwan!

745
00:52:52,344 --> 00:52:53,804
Danger, danger.

746
00:52:53,971 --> 00:52:56,056
If you're gonna shoot, do it from there.

747
00:52:56,056 --> 00:52:57,850
It's too dangerous here.

748
00:52:58,267 --> 00:52:59,768
Let's go, will you?

749
00:53:04,231 --> 00:53:06,231
Are you okay?

750
00:53:05,107 --> 00:53:06,191
Sorry sorry!

751
00:53:06,275 --> 00:53:07,484
What the hell is wrong with you?

752
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:10,529
That's why I said, it's too dangerous here!

753
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:13,324
- Let's go.
- Don't touch!

754
00:53:57,284 --> 00:53:59,661
Mister, the soldiers have gone crazy.

755
00:53:59,661 --> 00:54:01,538
Hurry up and run!

756
00:54:02,122 --> 00:54:06,085
Damned commie needs to be taught a lesson!

757
00:54:06,919 --> 00:54:08,128
Get rid of him!

758
00:54:11,006 --> 00:54:13,092
Hey, who's that?

759
00:54:14,093 --> 00:54:15,094
Get him.

760
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:19,056
Do you have a death wish? We need to go!

761
00:54:26,522 --> 00:54:28,440
Mister, this way! This way!

762
00:54:28,524 --> 00:54:30,524
Over here!

763
00:54:29,483 --> 00:54:30,526
Hurry!

764
00:55:03,475 --> 00:55:04,977
Huh? Isn't she...?

765
00:55:13,402 --> 00:55:14,445
Mister!

766
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,411
Mister, hurry up!

767
00:55:49,938 --> 00:55:52,316
That's why I kept saying danger!

768
00:55:55,944 --> 00:55:57,571
Is that thing expensive?

769
00:55:58,238 --> 00:56:01,909
I've never seen one before. Should I ask him?

770
00:56:01,909 --> 00:56:03,994
No, don't ask.

771
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:08,415
What? It wasn't my fault.

772
00:56:13,504 --> 00:56:15,923
But why were those soldiers acting that way?

773
00:56:16,507 --> 00:56:20,552
Beating and chasing people
who weren't doing anything.

774
00:56:21,762 --> 00:56:25,140
I don't know either. We just don't know why.

775
00:56:26,517 --> 00:56:28,310
Oh god, look at the time.

776
00:56:28,393 --> 00:56:30,145
Hey! Let's go Seoul.

777
00:56:31,522 --> 00:56:33,482
Yeah, okay. Let's go back to Seoul.

778
00:56:33,482 --> 00:56:34,483
Okay, okay.

779
00:56:35,192 --> 00:56:37,611
Then, what about you? We're going to Seoul.

780
00:56:38,237 --> 00:56:41,907
Yes, of course. Then let me off up there.

781
00:56:41,907 --> 00:56:43,033
- Okay.
- Thanks.

782
00:56:50,666 --> 00:56:52,626
Please promise me.

783
00:56:53,919 --> 00:56:55,420
You have to show our news.

784
00:56:57,673 --> 00:57:01,677
Once this footage airs,
the entire world will be watching.

785
00:57:02,469 --> 00:57:03,679
You are not alone.

786
00:57:05,847 --> 00:57:07,057
Thank you so much.

787
00:57:14,898 --> 00:57:16,984
Sir, have a safe trip back.

788
00:57:17,484 --> 00:57:18,819
Wait, kid!

789
00:57:19,695 --> 00:57:21,363
What's your name?

790
00:57:22,447 --> 00:57:24,449
Jae-sik. Gu Jae-sik.

791
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:27,369
Gu Jae-sik... Practice hard, okay?

792
00:57:27,369 --> 00:57:29,162
I'll watch your song contest on TV.

793
00:57:30,706 --> 00:57:31,707
Okay.

794
00:57:34,543 --> 00:57:35,711
Have a safe trip.

795
00:57:54,146 --> 00:57:56,607
Come on, not again.

796
00:58:05,324 --> 00:58:06,700
Did it break down?

797
00:58:08,118 --> 00:58:09,202
What happened?

798
00:58:37,356 --> 00:58:38,440
Isn't that...?

799
00:58:38,565 --> 00:58:40,817
I told you it was him! The Seoul driver.

800
00:58:41,151 --> 00:58:43,151
You were right.

801
00:58:42,110 --> 00:58:43,236
Car's broken?

802
00:58:43,612 --> 00:58:45,447
That's bad.

803
00:58:45,864 --> 00:58:47,866
Man, the repair shop's closed.

804
00:58:47,866 --> 00:58:49,534
- Sure is.
- Yeah.

805
00:59:07,761 --> 00:59:09,554
I'm sure they'll fix it soon.

806
00:59:22,401 --> 00:59:23,694
Wow!

807
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:26,863
Is this your daughter?

808
00:59:26,947 --> 00:59:29,908
Whoa, she's so cute!

809
00:59:29,908 --> 00:59:33,328
You've got hidden talents!
And your wife is pretty too.

810
00:59:34,246 --> 00:59:36,623
What a relief she took after
her mother instead of...

811
00:59:40,335 --> 00:59:43,422
His daughter, huh? Pretty, isn't it?

812
00:59:43,422 --> 00:59:45,590
Ah, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

813
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:46,758
No touch!

814
00:59:52,013 --> 00:59:54,013
You ready?

815
00:59:52,973 --> 00:59:54,182
- Yeah, just a sec.
- Okay.

816
00:59:54,182 --> 00:59:56,143
Ready. Try starting it!

817
00:59:56,143 --> 00:59:57,561
Give it a go.

818
01:00:06,778 --> 01:00:09,406
This car already ran over 600,000km!

819
01:00:10,282 --> 01:00:12,743
How'd you drive all the way here?

820
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:16,788
- The transmission is too old.
- Need to change the starter?

821
01:00:17,247 --> 01:00:18,915
That's a bummer.

822
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:22,294
I heard the repair shop's all out of parts.

823
01:00:24,629 --> 01:00:28,967
What about parts from another car?
He can have mine.

824
01:00:29,593 --> 01:00:34,848
I changed my starter recently,
so better switch with mine.

825
01:00:34,848 --> 01:00:37,434
Then, leave it here for now.

826
01:00:37,434 --> 01:00:41,688
I'll find a way to make it run a short distance.

827
01:00:41,688 --> 01:00:43,064
How long will it take?

828
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,317
I need to be in Seoul before the curfew.

829
01:00:46,485 --> 01:00:48,987
- It'll take at least 2 hours.
- Yeah.

830
01:00:49,196 --> 01:00:51,114
Better leave for Seoul tomorrow.

831
01:00:51,114 --> 01:00:53,283
Curfew here is 9 o'clock.

832
01:00:53,283 --> 01:00:55,577
You don't want to be out past curfew.

833
01:00:56,495 --> 01:00:58,330
- Is there a phone somewhere?
- What for?

834
01:00:58,663 --> 01:01:01,249
Those bastards have cut all the phone lines.

835
01:01:01,249 --> 01:01:02,250
What?

836
01:01:05,837 --> 01:01:09,174
Isn't there any way? I need to call home.

837
01:01:09,174 --> 01:01:11,676
What're you so worried about?

838
01:01:11,676 --> 01:01:14,304
If a man's out working,
he can stay out a night or two.

839
01:01:14,304 --> 01:01:19,017
My daughter's home alone. And she's only 11.

840
01:01:19,017 --> 01:01:21,019
Then where's her mom?

841
01:01:21,019 --> 01:01:23,019
What?

842
01:01:21,978 --> 01:01:23,522
Oh, that poor thing.

843
01:01:24,147 --> 01:01:26,107
Too young to be alone...

844
01:01:29,277 --> 01:01:30,779
Oh my.

845
01:01:34,407 --> 01:01:38,245
Mr. Kim, if it's about money,
let me pay for the repairs.

846
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:44,167
You bastard, did I ask you for money?

847
01:01:45,752 --> 01:01:47,754
You knew everything, right?

848
01:01:47,754 --> 01:01:49,381
Danger, you knew it!

849
01:01:49,381 --> 01:01:50,507
Why are you yelling at me?

850
01:01:50,507 --> 01:01:52,050
It's not my fault your car broke down.

851
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:54,177
And you knew exactly that
it would be dangerous here!

852
01:01:54,344 --> 01:01:55,804
What's this prick saying?

853
01:01:55,804 --> 01:01:59,724
Mister, calm down! He says you knew the danger.

854
01:01:59,724 --> 01:02:01,810
Bullshit! Like hell I did!

855
01:02:02,352 --> 01:02:05,063
And why do you keep
taking this foreigner's side, huh?

856
01:02:05,063 --> 01:02:06,356
What?

857
01:02:06,731 --> 01:02:07,983
Just take the money.

858
01:02:07,983 --> 01:02:09,985
Take the money. Take the money, here.

859
01:02:10,026 --> 01:02:11,695
Get that away from me!

860
01:02:11,695 --> 01:02:12,779
Get it away!

861
01:02:18,076 --> 01:02:19,286
Oh my.

862
01:02:20,328 --> 01:02:21,329
Just stop it!

863
01:02:22,289 --> 01:02:24,207
Just calm down, stop it!

864
01:02:26,877 --> 01:02:28,962
My, oh my...

865
01:02:50,108 --> 01:02:51,735
His young daughter at home alone.

866
01:02:52,152 --> 01:02:55,405
But he can't go back to Seoul. He cannot call.

867
01:02:58,366 --> 01:03:01,870
JÃ¼rgen Hinzpeter, Asia Correspondent
for Germany's public broadcaster.

868
01:03:03,496 --> 01:03:04,748
He came in from Japan.

869
01:03:09,502 --> 01:03:12,297
What are those assholes
in the security service doing?

870
01:03:12,756 --> 01:03:17,135
He entered without registering as
a reporter, so they missed him.

871
01:03:17,844 --> 01:03:20,263
He declared himself a missionary.

872
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:24,059
He seems to have planned the whole thing.

873
01:03:25,477 --> 01:03:28,980
He's using a Seoul taxi, so we'll find him soon.

874
01:03:30,273 --> 01:03:32,150
So that's where you live... the corner house?

875
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:33,443
Yes, next to it.

876
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:35,612
We're almost here.

877
01:03:42,410 --> 01:03:43,703
Come on, hurry.

878
01:03:46,331 --> 01:03:49,542
Honey? I'm home!

879
01:03:51,336 --> 01:03:52,462
Dad!

880
01:03:52,545 --> 01:03:55,173
Goodness, why are you back so late?

881
01:03:55,173 --> 01:03:56,675
There was a lot going on.

882
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:00,261
Did you stay up waiting for Daddy?

883
01:04:01,763 --> 01:04:02,889
Who are they?

884
01:04:02,889 --> 01:04:05,433
It's a long story. Can you make us dinner?

885
01:04:05,725 --> 01:04:09,646
- Yes, but not much to eat.
- Fine with just kimchi.

886
01:04:09,646 --> 01:04:12,232
Come on, let's go in. Please...

887
01:04:14,651 --> 01:04:16,277
It's okay if we have kimchi...

888
01:04:17,028 --> 01:04:18,363
Get in!

889
01:04:25,704 --> 01:04:26,871
Oh, my!

890
01:04:27,789 --> 01:04:31,084
Is this all we've got for such important guests?

891
01:04:35,630 --> 01:04:39,801
Don't worry. Your neighbor will
look after your daughter.

892
01:04:40,301 --> 01:04:43,638
You can call her on the way tomorrow morning.

893
01:04:44,055 --> 01:04:45,098
Yes.

894
01:04:45,098 --> 01:04:47,058
Dad, I'm hungry.

895
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:49,894
Oh, go ahead and eat. You're hungry?

896
01:04:49,894 --> 01:04:54,190
Try this first. My wife made it.

897
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:57,652
It's crisp, slightly bitter,
but with a real kick...

898
01:04:57,652 --> 01:05:00,697
Not sure if it's your style, but please try.

899
01:05:00,697 --> 01:05:02,073
Give it a try.

900
01:05:06,578 --> 01:05:07,620
That's hot!

901
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:09,414
This is spicy, hot.

902
01:05:09,414 --> 01:05:11,791
Oh, not a problem. I can handle spicy.

903
01:05:17,047 --> 01:05:18,423
Wow, he eats well.

904
01:05:19,507 --> 01:05:21,009
Oh my god. This is a shock.

905
01:05:21,176 --> 01:05:22,218
Wasser!

906
01:05:22,886 --> 01:05:24,345
- What?
- Water!

907
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:30,226
Too spicy for him!

908
01:05:31,061 --> 01:05:33,061
Hot!

909
01:05:31,811 --> 01:05:35,023
No wonder. He ate it too easy.

910
01:05:37,942 --> 01:05:39,694
What are you laughing for?

911
01:05:40,612 --> 01:05:44,032
You come to a foreign country,
break a camera, eat kimchi.

912
01:05:44,032 --> 01:05:45,950
You've been through a lot, too.

913
01:05:49,913 --> 01:05:51,081
Why'd you come here?

914
01:05:51,081 --> 01:05:52,540
Why you come here?

915
01:05:53,625 --> 01:05:54,709
Reporter.

916
01:05:55,418 --> 01:05:56,628
Was that English?

917
01:05:57,545 --> 01:06:00,173
Seoul drivers speak English?

918
01:06:00,173 --> 01:06:01,508
I'm a reporter.

919
01:06:01,925 --> 01:06:04,302
Reporters go wherever there is news.

920
01:06:04,302 --> 01:06:06,930
Then try translating what he just said.

921
01:06:09,557 --> 01:06:15,605
I'm a reporter here
for the news something like that...

922
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:18,316
Is that right?

923
01:06:18,733 --> 01:06:19,776
Yes.

924
01:06:21,528 --> 01:06:24,656
You're amazing. I never would've guessed!

925
01:06:25,365 --> 01:06:26,366
Ah...

926
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:29,035
Why you become a reporter?

927
01:06:30,537 --> 01:06:33,790
What's that, a poker card? I used to play, too...

928
01:06:33,832 --> 01:06:36,793
Not that, money. He means money.

929
01:06:36,793 --> 01:06:39,212
He means he did it because of the money?

930
01:06:39,546 --> 01:06:41,546
Yes.

931
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:43,800
Where do you spend your money?

932
01:06:50,974 --> 01:06:52,308
A hole in your sock.

933
01:06:53,601 --> 01:06:57,021
He acts like such a big shot,
but I guess he's not.

934
01:06:57,147 --> 01:06:59,941
How can you be worse off
than a widower like me?

935
01:07:08,783 --> 01:07:10,910
(Martial Law Soldiers
Massacre Civilians in Gwang-ju)

936
01:07:10,910 --> 01:07:12,871
Now that's a real newspaper!

937
01:07:13,788 --> 01:07:17,750
There's no turning back after this. So if anyone...

938
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:19,586
Are you the only reporter here?

939
01:07:20,211 --> 01:07:22,338
We've all made up our minds.

940
01:07:23,298 --> 01:07:25,967
Open the door!

941
01:07:45,111 --> 01:07:47,614
Are you trying to close us down?

942
01:07:47,614 --> 01:07:51,868
But Chief! We're reporters, aren't we?

943
01:07:51,868 --> 01:07:55,997
Shouldn't we at least try to tell the people

944
01:07:56,539 --> 01:08:00,627
what's happening here and why?

945
01:08:00,627 --> 01:08:02,712
What will happen then?

946
01:08:03,671 --> 01:08:07,759
They will shut us down, and drag us all off!

947
01:08:07,759 --> 01:08:10,094
Come on, get them out!

948
01:08:12,013 --> 01:08:13,765
Let go! Chief! Chief!

949
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:21,522
Will this stop bullets?

950
01:08:22,148 --> 01:08:25,985
Of course not. It's to cover the lights.

951
01:08:25,985 --> 01:08:27,195
Right.

952
01:08:28,112 --> 01:08:29,614
It's time for evening news.

953
01:08:30,114 --> 01:08:34,118
Why bother watching useless crap?

954
01:08:34,369 --> 01:08:37,622
Who knows, maybe they'll say something today.

955
01:08:38,748 --> 01:08:40,500
I doubt it...

956
01:08:43,378 --> 01:08:44,837
- The disturbance in Gwang-ju...
- It's on.

957
01:08:44,837 --> 01:08:46,547
is not yet contained...

958
01:08:46,547 --> 01:08:48,675
- Have some fruit.
- Hey, quiet!

959
01:08:48,841 --> 01:08:54,389
...with student radicals
and gangsters gathering in Gwang-ju

960
01:08:54,389 --> 01:08:58,768
and spreading groundless rumors.

961
01:08:58,768 --> 01:09:03,022
To date, 1 civilian has been killed,
and 5 members of the military...

962
01:09:03,982 --> 01:09:05,149
Those fuckers!

963
01:09:05,149 --> 01:09:06,192
Honey!

964
01:09:06,192 --> 01:09:09,696
How can they say that?
So many people died today!

965
01:09:09,946 --> 01:09:12,532
Is the news just allowed to lie like that?

966
01:09:13,199 --> 01:09:16,035
Why did we have to watch that crap?

967
01:09:16,119 --> 01:09:18,246
God that sets me off!

968
01:09:19,747 --> 01:09:20,999
That's not true.

969
01:09:23,793 --> 01:09:28,089
As soon as I get back to Japan,
my footage will hit the news.

970
01:09:28,589 --> 01:09:30,133
The whole world will see.

971
01:09:33,011 --> 01:09:35,847
Mr. Kim will take me back to the airport, and...

972
01:09:38,850 --> 01:09:42,937
Anyhow without him,
I would have never made it to Gwang-ju.

973
01:09:46,774 --> 01:09:51,112
He can broadcast it when he
gets to Japan, with Mr. Kim's help.

974
01:09:51,904 --> 01:09:57,118
And Mr. Kim also helped him get pass
the soldiers blocking the roads.

975
01:09:58,828 --> 01:10:02,206
You're amazing. Both of you.

976
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:07,211
Well, a driver has to go where the customer says.

977
01:10:07,211 --> 01:10:08,212
Don't worry, don't worry.

978
01:10:08,212 --> 01:10:10,506
I'll take you right to the airport tomorrow.

979
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:11,924
Airport, okay?

980
01:10:12,925 --> 01:10:16,304
By the sound of it,
I should plead to both of you...

981
01:10:16,971 --> 01:10:19,140
Please make this work.

982
01:10:19,182 --> 01:10:22,643
I'd beg you on my knees, really!

983
01:10:22,727 --> 01:10:25,688
No, I'm really good at that.

984
01:10:26,522 --> 01:10:27,982
On my knees!

985
01:10:28,441 --> 01:10:29,984
Forget that.

986
01:10:29,984 --> 01:10:33,613
Sing us a song instead.
He's entering a song contest.

987
01:10:33,613 --> 01:10:36,532
We'll judge if you deserve a prize, so sing!

988
01:10:36,532 --> 01:10:38,409
- Oh, no way!
- Please.

989
01:10:39,535 --> 01:10:41,245
I do guitar, not vocals.

990
01:10:41,579 --> 01:10:43,122
What's the difference?

991
01:10:44,374 --> 01:10:45,708
Give him a hand!

992
01:10:50,338 --> 01:10:52,590
What should I do?

993
01:11:01,641 --> 01:11:03,559
Wow, looking good!

994
01:11:09,607 --> 01:11:14,445
What can I do if you leave me like this?

995
01:11:15,613 --> 01:11:20,868
What can I do to go on living without you?

996
01:11:22,453 --> 01:11:24,372
What? Why ring the gong?

997
01:11:24,372 --> 01:11:29,710
Students may protest against you,
to stop you from singing.

998
01:11:30,169 --> 01:11:33,714
I told you, I play guitar! But I'm not that bad!

999
01:11:34,257 --> 01:11:35,842
I shouldn't have asked him to sing.

1000
01:11:36,050 --> 01:11:37,260
Is that a new song?

1001
01:11:40,555 --> 01:11:42,557
I guess I'm no good.

1002
01:11:43,808 --> 01:11:46,185
You're really not a singer.

1003
01:11:50,106 --> 01:11:52,442
But there's something striking about him.

1004
01:11:52,442 --> 01:11:54,235
See, I told you!

1005
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:57,905
Oh, my. He looks just like your brother.

1006
01:11:57,905 --> 01:12:00,575
- That's right!
- Yes, they're similar!

1007
01:12:00,575 --> 01:12:02,493
- You mean Sang-chul?
- Yeah.

1008
01:12:03,536 --> 01:12:04,787
Who?

1009
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:08,458
Right, why didn't I see it before?

1010
01:12:09,417 --> 01:12:12,545
I have a younger brother.

1011
01:12:12,545 --> 01:12:14,964
You look just like him.

1012
01:12:15,506 --> 01:12:17,216
What do you think? Same-same?

1013
01:12:17,216 --> 01:12:18,926
- What do you mean?
- He looks like my husband.

1014
01:12:18,926 --> 01:12:20,926
Same, same.

1015
01:12:20,094 --> 01:12:21,846
I look like Peter, right?

1016
01:12:21,846 --> 01:12:22,847
Oh no!

1017
01:12:24,432 --> 01:12:25,600
What's that?

1018
01:12:27,435 --> 01:12:28,644
What's this sound?

1019
01:12:38,779 --> 01:12:42,325
That's by the TV station.

1020
01:12:43,075 --> 01:12:44,243
Yeah, I think so.

1021
01:12:44,243 --> 01:12:48,915
Bro! People are gathering over by the TV station!

1022
01:12:49,165 --> 01:12:52,001
The taxi drivers are all heading there, too.

1023
01:12:52,335 --> 01:12:54,879
- Really?
- I'll see you there.

1024
01:12:56,172 --> 01:12:59,467
(Night of May 20, 1980
Near Gwang-ju MBC TV Station)

1025
01:13:34,877 --> 01:13:36,837
The foreign reporter! Get the radio!

1026
01:14:05,950 --> 01:14:07,201
Jae-sik!

1027
01:14:17,628 --> 01:14:19,463
Mister, look out!

1028
01:14:20,047 --> 01:14:22,341
They're plainclothes soldiers!

1029
01:14:23,634 --> 01:14:24,885
What? Plainclothes?

1030
01:14:37,023 --> 01:14:38,441
Damned commies!

1031
01:15:05,843 --> 01:15:08,512
Go hide up there. I'll bring it up.

1032
01:15:09,805 --> 01:15:11,805
Hurry!

1033
01:15:28,366 --> 01:15:29,617
Where is he?

1034
01:15:30,868 --> 01:15:34,372
He didn't come this way.

1035
01:15:44,298 --> 01:15:45,508
Hello!

1036
01:15:48,427 --> 01:15:50,763
I know you're up there.

1037
01:15:51,972 --> 01:15:53,349
Mister.

1038
01:15:55,142 --> 01:15:58,104
If you give me the camera and film,

1039
01:15:58,938 --> 01:16:00,106
you two,

1040
01:16:00,272 --> 01:16:01,399
no...

1041
01:16:03,901 --> 01:16:06,570
the three of you including this kid...

1042
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:09,448
can go free.

1043
01:16:11,325 --> 01:16:12,410
What is he saying?

1044
01:16:24,505 --> 01:16:26,590
I'll count to ten.

1045
01:16:28,259 --> 01:16:30,136
And I'll let you decide

1046
01:16:31,887 --> 01:16:33,639
what the wise choice is.

1047
01:16:33,973 --> 01:16:35,474
He wants this.

1048
01:16:36,559 --> 01:16:39,103
Then we can live, and Jae-sik too.

1049
01:16:39,603 --> 01:16:40,730
Give safe.

1050
01:16:41,397 --> 01:16:44,108
Let's give it to him.

1051
01:16:44,734 --> 01:16:45,901
One

1052
01:16:47,153 --> 01:16:48,404
two

1053
01:16:54,827 --> 01:16:56,162
three

1054
01:16:58,122 --> 01:16:59,331
four

1055
01:17:00,875 --> 01:17:02,209
five

1056
01:17:04,545 --> 01:17:06,046
- What are you doing?
- six

1057
01:17:07,882 --> 01:17:09,175
seven

1058
01:17:11,844 --> 01:17:13,137
eight

1059
01:17:17,057 --> 01:17:19,057
nine

1060
01:17:17,892 --> 01:17:19,101
Wait a minute!

1061
01:17:22,772 --> 01:17:25,649
The foreign reporter might be close by.

1062
01:17:25,691 --> 01:17:28,527
Let me speak in English to him.

1063
01:17:31,864 --> 01:17:34,158
I'll beg him to save me.

1064
01:17:48,339 --> 01:17:50,007
Can you hear me?

1065
01:17:54,261 --> 01:17:56,806
I can't hold this soldier much longer.

1066
01:18:01,477 --> 01:18:02,728
So please,

1067
01:18:04,230 --> 01:18:07,525
go now and show the world what's happening in here.

1068
01:18:10,653 --> 01:18:12,154
- Where are you going?
- So please...

1069
01:18:12,154 --> 01:18:13,531
We need to give him this.

1070
01:18:15,783 --> 01:18:17,618
They're coming up!

1071
01:18:18,869 --> 01:18:19,870
Hey!

1072
01:18:24,458 --> 01:18:25,501
Damn!

1073
01:18:26,752 --> 01:18:27,795
Give me the bag!

1074
01:18:31,799 --> 01:18:32,967
Get away!

1075
01:18:33,050 --> 01:18:34,260
I'm okay!

1076
01:18:35,052 --> 01:18:36,136
Over there!

1077
01:18:38,222 --> 01:18:40,222
Get him!

1078
01:18:58,951 --> 01:19:00,951
There!

1079
01:20:23,243 --> 01:20:24,703
Where's the damn reporter?

1080
01:20:28,832 --> 01:20:31,210
Where are you running, commie?

1081
01:20:31,627 --> 01:20:34,213
Spare me, I'm not a commie!

1082
01:20:37,383 --> 01:20:40,302
You prick! Damn commie!

1083
01:20:45,724 --> 01:20:47,267
I'm really not a commie!

1084
01:20:48,018 --> 01:20:50,312
I'm not even from Gwang-ju. I'm from Seoul.

1085
01:20:50,312 --> 01:20:54,024
#10-8, Hwayang-dong 384,
Sungdong-gu, Seoul.

1086
01:20:57,569 --> 01:20:59,113
Yeah.

1087
01:21:00,406 --> 01:21:01,532
I know.

1088
01:21:02,741 --> 01:21:04,243
The Seoul taxi.

1089
01:21:05,911 --> 01:21:08,831
You're that commie who
brought in the German reporter.

1090
01:21:09,123 --> 01:21:12,418
The shit bastard who sold his country for money!

1091
01:21:13,794 --> 01:21:16,755
And yet you say, "I'm not a commie!"

1092
01:21:17,131 --> 01:21:22,636
"I'm not a commie!"

1093
01:21:30,519 --> 01:21:32,479
How dare you...

1094
01:21:48,829 --> 01:21:50,205
We have to get out of here.

1095
01:22:00,799 --> 01:22:02,760
My god, I was so worried!

1096
01:22:03,093 --> 01:22:07,014
I'm glad you made it back. But where's Jae-sik?

1097
01:22:08,057 --> 01:22:09,558
Wasn't he with you?

1098
01:22:10,809 --> 01:22:12,809
Huh?

1099
01:22:39,963 --> 01:22:41,215
You know...

1100
01:22:45,052 --> 01:22:48,263
I earned some money in Saudi Arabia.

1101
01:22:50,766 --> 01:22:54,812
But my wife got sick
and I spent it all on hospital bills.

1102
01:22:56,188 --> 01:23:00,150
At the end, my wife insisted that I buy that taxi.

1103
01:23:02,736 --> 01:23:05,322
and the doctor said so too,

1104
01:23:09,159 --> 01:23:11,787
so I should look after our daughter.

1105
01:23:18,043 --> 01:23:21,421
We could have tried more meds,

1106
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:30,514
but I didn't argue. That's the kind of guy I am.

1107
01:23:32,933 --> 01:23:35,811
The rest have to go on living, right?

1108
01:23:40,732 --> 01:23:44,570
Because after my wife died,
I got drunk every day.

1109
01:23:53,704 --> 01:23:59,001
One day I woke up,

1110
01:24:04,882 --> 01:24:11,096
she was crying holding onto her mom's old clothes.

1111
01:24:19,104 --> 01:24:21,190
She must have missed her so much.

1112
01:24:28,697 --> 01:24:31,950
I quit drinking that day.

1113
01:24:36,413 --> 01:24:40,375
I'm the only one she has left.

1114
01:25:49,444 --> 01:25:50,821
What are you doing?

1115
01:25:53,198 --> 01:25:56,660
The paratroopers are searching for a Seoul taxi!

1116
01:25:56,952 --> 01:26:00,122
Should've said you're going.
You don't even know the roads!

1117
01:26:00,455 --> 01:26:03,458
Here, take this and...

1118
01:26:07,337 --> 01:26:12,384
These are hidden roads out of Gwang-ju.

1119
01:26:14,594 --> 01:26:17,848
And the reporter asked me to give you this.

1120
01:26:18,598 --> 01:26:20,767
How can I accept that?

1121
01:26:20,892 --> 01:26:21,893
What?

1122
01:26:22,394 --> 01:26:25,689
If a driver took a passenger,
he should accept the fare!

1123
01:26:25,731 --> 01:26:27,649
Just take it.

1124
01:26:28,358 --> 01:26:30,319
I can't take that money.

1125
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:33,613
Just the repairs will cost you a lot.

1126
01:26:33,613 --> 01:26:36,074
Don't argue. Just take it!

1127
01:26:38,285 --> 01:26:39,578
On your way, now.

1128
01:26:39,995 --> 01:26:43,206
Your daughter must have waited all night. Hurry.

1129
01:26:45,751 --> 01:26:49,087
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1130
01:26:53,008 --> 01:26:54,801
Why are you sorry?

1131
01:26:55,218 --> 01:26:57,220
Bastards out there should be.

1132
01:27:06,229 --> 01:27:09,649
It's damn fine weather.

1133
01:27:14,488 --> 01:27:18,575
Come visit with your daughter someday.

1134
01:27:19,159 --> 01:27:22,079
We'll take my son and go on a picnic.

1135
01:27:24,247 --> 01:27:25,749
Take care of yourself.

1136
01:27:30,253 --> 01:27:31,713
You take care.

1137
01:28:28,311 --> 01:28:30,313
It'll take an hour to fix it.

1138
01:28:30,730 --> 01:28:32,607
Don't stay cramped in here.

1139
01:28:32,816 --> 01:28:37,320
There's a Buddha's day celebration
or something like that over there.

1140
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:38,864
Go take a walk around.

1141
01:28:38,989 --> 01:28:40,157
Can I use the phone?

1142
01:28:54,796 --> 01:28:56,796
Hello?

1143
01:28:55,630 --> 01:28:57,382
Dong-su, is my daughter there?

1144
01:28:57,382 --> 01:28:59,301
Where have you been?

1145
01:28:59,301 --> 01:29:00,469
Is she with you?

1146
01:29:00,469 --> 01:29:03,555
She just fell asleep. Wake her up?

1147
01:29:03,555 --> 01:29:05,390
No, let her sleep.

1148
01:29:06,016 --> 01:29:07,350
Is she okay?

1149
01:29:07,809 --> 01:29:10,896
If you're so worried, why did you stay out?

1150
01:29:11,855 --> 01:29:13,565
Did you really get that money?

1151
01:29:13,565 --> 01:29:14,774
Give me the phone.

1152
01:29:15,525 --> 01:29:18,320
Mr. Kim! Where are you?

1153
01:29:18,987 --> 01:29:20,071
I'm...

1154
01:29:21,615 --> 01:29:23,909
I'm in the countryside and my car broke down.

1155
01:29:24,284 --> 01:29:28,622
I left 2,000 won in my drawer.
Please give it to Eunjung...

1156
01:29:28,622 --> 01:29:33,376
She's been up all night waiting,
so why make promises!

1157
01:29:33,376 --> 01:29:35,295
Hey, give me the phone!

1158
01:29:35,795 --> 01:29:39,758
You'll be back soon? Let's talk then. Stop it!

1159
01:29:58,735 --> 01:29:59,819
Hello!

1160
01:30:03,782 --> 01:30:05,325
How old is your daughter?

1161
01:30:05,325 --> 01:30:07,325
Eleven.

1162
01:30:06,159 --> 01:30:08,870
Then how about these?

1163
01:30:08,995 --> 01:30:13,959
These are sturdy and nice. Moms love them.

1164
01:30:14,042 --> 01:30:15,502
They're really popular!

1165
01:30:17,754 --> 01:30:22,050
If she's 11, she'll need size 200...

1166
01:30:22,050 --> 01:30:23,677
Give me size 210.

1167
01:30:23,969 --> 01:30:25,929
Size 200 is getting small for her.

1168
01:30:25,929 --> 01:30:30,809
What a thoughtful father.
You know her shoe size!

1169
01:30:32,269 --> 01:30:34,521
Those are a bit expensive...

1170
01:30:40,986 --> 01:30:42,279
A bowl of noodles, please.

1171
01:30:47,450 --> 01:30:50,203
Huh? I thought you went bill collecting?

1172
01:30:50,203 --> 01:30:52,539
Ended up wasting my time.

1173
01:30:52,956 --> 01:30:54,332
Ma'am, another bottle of soju!

1174
01:30:54,332 --> 01:30:56,332
Sure.

1175
01:30:55,250 --> 01:30:57,627
What, people wouldn't pay?

1176
01:30:58,128 --> 01:31:00,130
I couldn't even get into Gwang-ju.

1177
01:31:00,630 --> 01:31:04,009
I heard people were killed
in Gwang-ju, I guess it's true!

1178
01:31:04,593 --> 01:31:05,969
People were killed?

1179
01:31:06,136 --> 01:31:10,348
Yeah, soldiers raided the city,
and all hell broke loose.

1180
01:31:10,348 --> 01:31:12,348
What are you talking about?

1181
01:31:11,308 --> 01:31:12,767
I don't know for sure,

1182
01:31:12,892 --> 01:31:18,148
but I heard many people were killed,
and a whole bunch arrested.

1183
01:31:18,148 --> 01:31:20,483
That's not it.

1184
01:31:20,817 --> 01:31:25,322
A few innocent soldiers were killed in
violent college student protests.

1185
01:31:25,322 --> 01:31:29,826
No, someone really saw
people getting killed there.

1186
01:31:29,826 --> 01:31:31,578
It was in the news.

1187
01:31:31,870 --> 01:31:35,832
Not just students, but hardcore Communists.

1188
01:31:35,832 --> 01:31:38,168
They even brought gangsters from Seoul!

1189
01:31:38,501 --> 01:31:41,755
Really? It was in the news?

1190
01:31:42,297 --> 01:31:43,715
Yeah!

1191
01:31:43,798 --> 01:31:46,718
It's in the newspaper too, a full-page story.

1192
01:31:46,718 --> 01:31:51,264
If they want to protest,
why not just do it in Seoul?

1193
01:31:51,264 --> 01:31:53,933
(Protests in Gwang-ju)
Keeping me from doing my job.

1194
01:31:56,811 --> 01:32:00,649
(Rogue Groups and Rioters...)

1195
01:32:29,594 --> 01:32:34,474
You must've been really hungry. Have this, too.

1196
01:32:44,526 --> 01:32:47,278
It's delicious... Delicious.

1197
01:32:55,745 --> 01:32:57,706
Taxi, taxi!

1198
01:33:04,087 --> 01:33:06,089
So pretty.

1199
01:33:07,757 --> 01:33:11,261
Always bought her sneakers,
never a nice pair of shoes...

1200
01:33:11,803 --> 01:33:13,763
Eun-jung will love these.

1201
01:33:19,144 --> 01:33:23,857
The river water flows

1202
01:33:24,524 --> 01:33:27,777
under the 3rd Han River Bridge

1203
01:33:29,446 --> 01:33:34,492
Like a bird, like wind, like water

1204
01:33:35,285 --> 01:33:38,538
it continues to flow.

1205
01:33:38,997 --> 01:33:43,752
Yesterday I met you again

1206
01:33:44,627 --> 01:33:49,632
and we struck a solemn vow.

1207
01:33:50,467 --> 01:33:54,679
That in the morning we'd take the first train

1208
01:33:58,683 --> 01:34:03,855
and leave together...

1209
01:34:23,374 --> 01:34:26,211
Eun-jung, what should I do?

1210
01:34:27,337 --> 01:34:28,588
What do I do?

1211
01:34:50,485 --> 01:34:52,237
One more phone call, please.

1212
01:34:54,364 --> 01:34:55,615
Eun-jung, are you awake?

1213
01:34:56,032 --> 01:34:58,243
Daddy, are we going on a picnic?

1214
01:34:58,576 --> 01:35:01,871
Sorry, there's something I need to do.

1215
01:35:02,580 --> 01:35:04,332
Let's go another time.

1216
01:35:05,708 --> 01:35:07,043
When?

1217
01:35:08,962 --> 01:35:13,091
I left a customer behind.

1218
01:35:14,300 --> 01:35:17,178
Someone who really needs to take my taxi.

1219
01:35:18,388 --> 01:35:20,431
I'll come home right after.

1220
01:35:20,431 --> 01:35:23,935
So, be nice and don't fight with Sang-gu.

1221
01:35:38,658 --> 01:35:49,794
Until Mt. Baekdu is worn away
and the East Sea's waters run dry,

1222
01:35:50,378 --> 01:35:59,554
God protect and preserve our country.

1223
01:36:08,104 --> 01:36:09,230
Where has he gone?

1224
01:36:09,898 --> 01:36:11,024
To the hospital.

1225
01:36:12,191 --> 01:36:13,443
The hospital?

1226
01:36:53,316 --> 01:36:54,901
Why are you back?

1227
01:37:20,343 --> 01:37:23,346
The paratroopers dragged him off,

1228
01:37:25,807 --> 01:37:29,352
and he died on the way.

1229
01:37:31,187 --> 01:37:34,524
So they just threw him in a rice field.

1230
01:37:35,900 --> 01:37:38,319
There aren't enough coffins in Gwang-ju.

1231
01:37:39,904 --> 01:37:43,866
So some students went to get more...

1232
01:38:25,908 --> 01:38:27,243
Why are you sitting there?

1233
01:38:30,079 --> 01:38:32,457
You need to record all this.

1234
01:38:39,338 --> 01:38:41,632
You promised, to tell people.

1235
01:38:42,842 --> 01:38:47,430
It needs to be broadcast so people will know.

1236
01:38:49,182 --> 01:38:50,975
You're a reporter, shoot this.

1237
01:38:52,060 --> 01:38:55,104
Jae-sik, and this too.

1238
01:38:55,855 --> 01:38:56,981
Here.

1239
01:39:41,526 --> 01:39:43,236
Open your eyes!

1240
01:39:48,616 --> 01:39:50,827
How can you leave me.

1241
01:39:54,163 --> 01:39:56,833
And our unborn baby!

1242
01:40:08,594 --> 01:40:10,012
Make way!

1243
01:40:10,429 --> 01:40:13,141
Over here, Doctor! Please help over here.

1244
01:40:13,141 --> 01:40:14,475
He's been shot.

1245
01:40:16,644 --> 01:40:18,855
Bro, what do we do?

1246
01:40:19,105 --> 01:40:22,817
They're really trying to wipe us all out!

1247
01:40:22,817 --> 01:40:24,902
People were singing the national anthem,

1248
01:40:25,319 --> 01:40:27,905
when the paratroopers just started shooting.

1249
01:40:27,905 --> 01:40:30,241
God, so many people have been shot!

1250
01:40:30,533 --> 01:40:32,618
We need to get there.

1251
01:40:33,119 --> 01:40:35,246
You two go to Seoul, quickly.

1252
01:40:35,872 --> 01:40:37,123
I'm coming with you!

1253
01:40:37,623 --> 01:40:40,877
Mr. Kim, you go back to Seoul.
I need to keep filming.

1254
01:40:40,877 --> 01:40:42,086
Hey, hey.

1255
01:40:42,128 --> 01:40:43,546
You paid me the fare.

1256
01:40:44,088 --> 01:40:45,464
We go together.

1257
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:47,175
I taxi driver,

1258
01:40:47,592 --> 01:40:49,051
You taxi customer.

1259
01:40:49,927 --> 01:40:50,928
Okay?

1260
01:40:51,554 --> 01:40:52,930
Okay! together.

1261
01:41:30,092 --> 01:41:31,886
(Dear citizens of Gwang-ju.)

1262
01:41:31,886 --> 01:41:33,387
(One, stay at home.
Two, don't believe rumors.)

1263
01:41:34,555 --> 01:41:35,640
He needs hospital, now!

1264
01:41:35,640 --> 01:41:37,141
Get ahold of yourself!

1265
01:41:46,776 --> 01:41:49,528
Why are they shooting us?

1266
01:41:57,453 --> 01:41:59,330
Don't go out.

1267
01:42:04,502 --> 01:42:06,045
My god, look at that.

1268
01:42:07,588 --> 01:42:09,674
What's going on here?

1269
01:42:13,928 --> 01:42:15,554
Over there! She's shot!

1270
01:42:48,337 --> 01:42:49,839
Get a hold of yourself!

1271
01:43:14,405 --> 01:43:16,615
How can they just shoot people?

1272
01:43:19,702 --> 01:43:21,370
How can they do this to us?

1273
01:43:21,579 --> 01:43:23,539
How many times has it been?

1274
01:43:24,290 --> 01:43:26,292
They really plan to kill us all!

1275
01:43:26,292 --> 01:43:29,920
We can't leave injured people like that!

1276
01:43:30,463 --> 01:43:35,384
That's it. Let's drive our taxis in.

1277
01:43:36,344 --> 01:43:37,553
Wait...

1278
01:43:42,266 --> 01:43:44,266
Here.

1279
01:43:45,061 --> 01:43:48,105
I can drive well. Let's go together.

1280
01:44:18,969 --> 01:44:20,346
Look! The taxi drivers!

1281
01:45:13,732 --> 01:45:14,900
Thank you.

1282
01:45:37,089 --> 01:45:38,299
Young-pyo!

1283
01:45:39,884 --> 01:45:42,219
- Young-pyo!
- Are you okay?

1284
01:45:42,761 --> 01:45:43,971
Hey, duck down.

1285
01:45:43,971 --> 01:45:45,222
Let's help them!

1286
01:45:46,765 --> 01:45:49,518
Let's save the wounded! Come on!

1287
01:45:56,650 --> 01:45:59,153
- Don't lose focus.
- Come here.

1288
01:46:01,071 --> 01:46:02,156
Are you okay?

1289
01:46:03,240 --> 01:46:04,658
Please help me!

1290
01:46:10,206 --> 01:46:12,625
Bro, get in here!

1291
01:46:13,876 --> 01:46:15,044
Gently!

1292
01:46:35,689 --> 01:46:37,483
Here, over here!

1293
01:46:37,900 --> 01:46:39,109
Hold on a sec.

1294
01:48:32,181 --> 01:48:33,641
You need to go now.

1295
01:48:34,141 --> 01:48:35,392
They're getting closer.

1296
01:48:35,392 --> 01:48:38,228
You have to go now.
Or it will be impossible.

1297
01:48:38,687 --> 01:48:40,981
Let us take care of this.

1298
01:48:41,398 --> 01:48:46,362
Go back, and please,
prove all their lies wrong!

1299
01:48:46,362 --> 01:48:50,282
We cannot do it, but you can.
Please, for us.

1300
01:48:55,537 --> 01:48:58,499
Go quickly! Things are getting bad here.

1301
01:50:04,189 --> 01:50:06,108
Mr. Kim, we must go now.

1302
01:50:32,843 --> 01:50:34,136
Block all checkpoints.

1303
01:50:50,903 --> 01:50:52,154
Can you get us out?

1304
01:50:54,865 --> 01:50:55,949
Don't worry.

1305
01:50:57,451 --> 01:50:59,745
I'll get you to the airport no matter what.

1306
01:51:47,417 --> 01:51:48,752
Good afternoon.

1307
01:51:50,337 --> 01:51:51,505
Where are you going?

1308
01:51:52,005 --> 01:51:53,757
I'm taking a customer to Seoul.

1309
01:51:53,757 --> 01:51:54,925
Is it a Seoul taxi?

1310
01:51:55,008 --> 01:51:56,385
No, a Gwang-ju taxi.

1311
01:51:58,637 --> 01:51:59,805
Where's your home?

1312
01:52:01,306 --> 01:52:02,474
Why?

1313
01:52:02,474 --> 01:52:04,601
Answer, you bastard!

1314
01:52:05,352 --> 01:52:07,396
And why don't you have a Gwang-ju accent?

1315
01:52:08,730 --> 01:52:10,899
I moved here not long ago.

1316
01:52:11,775 --> 01:52:14,695
What's going on? Why are you stopping us?

1317
01:52:19,449 --> 01:52:21,535
Hey, college boy! What's this bastard saying?

1318
01:52:24,162 --> 01:52:25,497
Where are you going?

1319
01:52:26,456 --> 01:52:27,541
I'm here on business.

1320
01:52:27,541 --> 01:52:30,669
But it's so dangerous in Gwang-ju,
you know all these riots?

1321
01:52:31,044 --> 01:52:32,963
So we go back to Seoul.

1322
01:52:33,505 --> 01:52:35,799
He came on business
but leaving to escape the riots.

1323
01:52:43,056 --> 01:52:44,850
Both of you, out of the car.

1324
01:52:45,100 --> 01:52:47,477
I don't understand. What's the problem?

1325
01:52:48,395 --> 01:52:49,479
Get out now.

1326
01:52:50,105 --> 01:52:53,817
Being a foreigner won't save you. Get out.

1327
01:53:15,505 --> 01:53:16,798
Open the trunk.

1328
01:53:41,490 --> 01:53:43,617
These are his souvenirs.

1329
01:53:43,784 --> 01:53:45,494
From Buddha's Birthday.

1330
01:54:16,525 --> 01:54:18,525
Let them through.

1331
01:54:20,487 --> 01:54:22,906
Sergeant, we have to stop all foreigners.

1332
01:54:22,906 --> 01:54:25,534
He's not a reporter, and it's not a Seoul taxi.

1333
01:54:26,410 --> 01:54:27,411
Let them through.

1334
01:54:31,540 --> 01:54:33,000
I said, let them through.

1335
01:54:34,418 --> 01:54:36,418
Yes, sir.

1336
01:55:02,738 --> 01:55:04,656
They said to stop taxis with foreigners!

1337
01:55:04,656 --> 01:55:06,033
Hey, close it!

1338
01:55:15,625 --> 01:55:17,961
A-34, A-34. Car with foreigner on the run.

1339
01:55:17,961 --> 01:55:19,463
Plate number 0310.

1340
01:55:20,172 --> 01:55:22,507
A-34, A-34. Car with foreigner on the run.

1341
01:55:22,507 --> 01:55:25,343
Plate number 0310.

1342
01:56:44,589 --> 01:56:46,049
This is awesome.

1343
01:56:56,351 --> 01:56:57,519
Run them over.

1344
01:57:11,158 --> 01:57:12,242
Bastards!

1345
01:57:12,868 --> 01:57:14,077
Shoot them all!

1346
01:57:15,620 --> 01:57:17,620
Damn it!

1347
01:57:26,381 --> 01:57:27,507
Bro, go faster!

1348
01:57:27,716 --> 01:57:29,426
Don't worry about me!

1349
01:58:04,336 --> 01:58:06,922
Come on bastards, let's go at it!

1350
01:58:30,570 --> 01:58:32,155
What's going on back there?

1351
01:58:50,924 --> 01:58:52,342
I'm sorry...

1352
01:59:09,609 --> 01:59:11,236
Take care of yourself!

1353
01:59:11,611 --> 01:59:13,405
Don't worry about us!

1354
01:59:44,102 --> 01:59:45,312
Step on it.

1355
01:59:45,895 --> 01:59:46,896
Step on it!

1356
02:01:33,753 --> 02:01:37,006
Yes, we're searching everywhere.
Don't worry, sir.

1357
02:01:37,006 --> 02:01:39,884
He called the airport just now
and reserved a flight.

1358
02:01:41,386 --> 02:01:42,804
Commander, we found him!

1359
02:01:42,804 --> 02:01:45,140
He booked the 10am plane to Japan tomorrow.

1360
02:01:46,182 --> 02:01:47,600
Yes, sir!

1361
02:01:47,600 --> 02:01:48,601
Hi.

1362
02:01:50,937 --> 02:01:51,938
Mr.Hinzpeter?

1363
02:01:51,938 --> 02:01:53,938
Yes.

1364
02:01:54,774 --> 02:01:58,987
Our system shows that you have a flight
booked for tomorrow at 10am?

1365
02:01:58,987 --> 02:02:01,156
Yes, but I'm somehow here today,

1366
02:02:01,156 --> 02:02:06,202
so I'd like to get onto the first flight out
to Japan and make it first class.

1367
02:02:50,580 --> 02:02:51,664
For your daughter.

1368
02:02:52,707 --> 02:02:54,000
This is for me?

1369
02:02:54,918 --> 02:02:56,918
Thank you.

1370
02:02:57,128 --> 02:02:58,880
Please give me your phone number.

1371
02:02:59,422 --> 02:03:01,422
What?

1372
02:03:00,381 --> 02:03:03,092
Your taxi. I'd like to pay for all the damage.

1373
02:03:04,344 --> 02:03:07,388
I'll get the news broadcast,
then come right back to Korea.

1374
02:03:07,889 --> 02:03:09,599
I'll call you when I return.

1375
02:03:14,020 --> 02:03:16,189
Ah, I forgot to buy cigarettes.

1376
02:03:18,358 --> 02:03:20,358
Please.

1377
02:03:30,119 --> 02:03:31,704
(Sa-Bok Cigarettes)

1378
02:03:36,251 --> 02:03:37,293
Here you are.

1379
02:03:47,929 --> 02:03:49,430
Hey, stop that!

1380
02:03:53,643 --> 02:03:54,769
You're a good man.

1381
02:03:56,187 --> 02:03:57,355
You did a good job.

1382
02:04:04,070 --> 02:04:06,573
You... you good job too.

1383
02:04:08,658 --> 02:04:11,452
Learn Korean, before you come next time.

1384
02:04:12,370 --> 02:04:15,039
Come back, speak Korean, okay?

1385
02:04:16,165 --> 02:04:18,165
Okay.

1386
02:04:19,460 --> 02:04:21,460
Go on.

1387
02:05:24,525 --> 02:05:26,152
The curfew starts soon.

1388
02:05:26,361 --> 02:05:29,614
Did your dad run off? Cause he's so poor?

1389
02:05:31,532 --> 02:05:34,786
Sang-gu! Stop bothering your friend!

1390
02:05:34,952 --> 02:05:37,914
But she hit me first!

1391
02:05:37,914 --> 02:05:39,749
How'd you end up that way?

1392
02:05:40,416 --> 02:05:43,127
Eun-jung, come have some fruit. Get in!

1393
02:06:17,120 --> 02:06:18,287
Daddy!

1394
02:06:21,165 --> 02:06:22,250
Eun-jung.

1395
02:06:32,009 --> 02:06:33,511
I'm sorry.

1396
02:06:34,345 --> 02:06:36,139
You waited so long...

1397
02:06:37,807 --> 02:06:41,018
Daddy, why are you crying?

1398
02:06:47,984 --> 02:06:49,152
Daddy...

1399
02:06:49,902 --> 02:06:55,408
There's still no end in sight
to the democratic uprising

1400
02:06:55,408 --> 02:06:57,702
in the Korean city of Gwang-ju.

1401
02:06:57,702 --> 02:07:02,498
From looking at the wounded,

1402
02:07:02,498 --> 02:07:09,338
we can witness the violence done
to protesters in the last two days.

1403
02:07:09,547 --> 02:07:15,303
The army has blockaded the city
and cut off all telephone and telex.

1404
02:07:16,179 --> 02:07:19,974
According to military sources,
as of Wednesday,

1405
02:07:19,974 --> 02:07:23,311
there have been 9 deaths and
about 60 people were injured.

1406
02:07:23,311 --> 02:07:26,773
However, students and protesters
mention much higher figures,

1407
02:07:29,567 --> 02:07:31,527
Are you sure you searched everywhere?

1408
02:07:31,694 --> 02:07:36,449
Yes, but there's no taxi driver with this name.

1409
02:07:38,826 --> 02:07:40,620
(Kim Sa-bok)

1410
02:07:41,621 --> 02:07:43,581
So even the number is wrong.

1411
02:07:44,582 --> 02:07:46,876
Kim Sa-bok may not be his real name.

1412
02:07:47,794 --> 02:07:51,714
It might be better not to look for him.

1413
02:08:10,233 --> 02:08:12,568
(Dec-03)

1414
02:08:28,626 --> 02:08:33,464
It is a great honor for me to
receive this award here in Korea.

1415
02:08:34,465 --> 02:08:38,636
I still remember the faces of
the citizens I met in Gwang-ju,

1416
02:08:39,262 --> 02:08:41,973
that spring of 1980.

1417
02:08:44,225 --> 02:08:46,269
And I will never forget.

1418
02:08:50,231 --> 02:08:55,319
But there is one face
in particular that I miss dearly.

1419
02:08:56,404 --> 02:09:00,533
My brave friend, Kim Sa-bok.

1420
02:09:02,493 --> 02:09:03,828
He is a taxi driver.

1421
02:09:10,418 --> 02:09:11,669
Hey.

1422
02:09:11,669 --> 02:09:12,962
Hey, young man!

1423
02:09:13,421 --> 02:09:15,756
Sorry, sir. I only have 10,000 won.

1424
02:09:15,756 --> 02:09:17,884
That's fine. Go on.

1425
02:09:19,802 --> 02:09:21,095
Thank you!

1426
02:09:21,095 --> 02:09:22,430
Watch your step.

1427
02:09:33,190 --> 02:09:35,067
Hey, wait!

1428
02:09:35,401 --> 02:09:39,071
Without him, news of the Gwang-ju Uprising

1429
02:09:39,071 --> 02:09:40,156
would have never reached the world.

1430
02:09:40,156 --> 02:09:41,282
Oh my.

1431
02:09:42,867 --> 02:09:46,203
I'm afraid my words fail to express my gratitude,

1432
02:09:46,579 --> 02:09:48,748
but you're always in my thoughts.

1433
02:09:48,748 --> 02:09:52,501
Mr. Kim, my dear friend.

1434
02:09:54,378 --> 02:09:56,378
Thank you.

1435
02:09:57,006 --> 02:09:58,549
I've missed you.

1436
02:10:03,638 --> 02:10:05,181
I'll keep waiting.

1437
02:10:06,849 --> 02:10:09,560
I hope to see you again soon.

1438
02:10:13,606 --> 02:10:17,151
(He said if not for Kim Sa-bok's help
he could never have made the report,

1439
02:10:17,151 --> 02:10:18,945
and he wishes to see him again.)

1440
02:10:18,945 --> 02:10:20,947
I'm more grateful to you.

1441
02:10:22,615 --> 02:10:24,200
Thank you, thank you.

1442
02:10:24,992 --> 02:10:27,203
I wanted to see you again, too.

1443
02:10:28,704 --> 02:10:30,414
At least I see you like this.

1444
02:10:31,248 --> 02:10:34,335
You've grown old too.

1445
02:10:52,311 --> 02:10:53,938
Hello, where to?

1446
02:10:53,938 --> 02:10:55,523
To Gwanghwamun, please.

1447
02:10:55,815 --> 02:10:58,234
Gwanghwamun, okay.

1448
02:11:31,642 --> 02:11:42,653
With the help of a taxi-driver Kim Sa-Bok, reporter Hinzpeter could risk his life
and spread actual news of distressed Gwang-ju to the world.

1449
02:11:43,821 --> 02:11:50,661
After May, 1980 Hinzpeter had searched for Kim Sa-Bok,
but he couldn't meet him again and died in January, 2016

1450
02:11:56,625 --> 02:11:59,628
Hinzpeter on November, 2015

1451
02:12:00,838 --> 02:12:05,718
It would be truly wonderful
if I could meet you again.

1452
02:12:11,057 --> 02:12:15,728
Oh... really, I'd be happy beyond words.

1453
02:12:25,446 --> 02:12:32,411
If I could find you through this footage,

1454
02:12:33,579 --> 02:12:37,958
and then meet you once again,

1455
02:12:39,251 --> 02:12:42,379
I would just be so happy.

1456
02:12:42,463 --> 02:12:47,968
I'd rush over to Seoul in an instant,

1457
02:12:48,177 --> 02:12:57,353
ride with you in your taxi,
and see the new Korea.
