1
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:01,144
I beseech Thee,
O my Savior,

2
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,273
to deliver me from my enemies,
visible and invisible,

3
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:08,235
shield our eyes and ears so that
we are not lured by Satan.

4
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,905
You are the healer of our souls,
and the one and only Savior.

5
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:16,159
We pray to Thee,
vanish our enemies to hell,

6
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,996
have them submit
under God's mighty hand.

7
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,956
Our Father in heaven,

8
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:23,208
hallowed be your name,

9
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,668
your kingdom come,

10
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:28,714
your will be done,
on earth as in heaven.

11
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,927
Deliver us from threats
and temptations from evil...

12
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:37,347
Father, do you think...

13
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:41,435
God forgot that I'm here?

14
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,191
Be unto us, O Lord,
in the face of the enemy,

15
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,152
- let not the enemy prevail against us.
- Father.

16
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:55,365
Why does it hurt so much?

17
00:01:56,867 --> 00:02:01,872
It's so tiring and scary...

18
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:07,336
But why did God abandon me?!

19
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:11,214
Free us from all curses,
so that peace will grace us.

20
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:26,146
Could you just kill me?

21
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,691
Or are you afraid you won't
go to heaven for killing?

22
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,943
Protect your most vulnerable flock,

23
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,447
save them from starved evil!

24
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:02,015
How could you feeble being
do anything?

25
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:08,563
This poor girl believes
in you for being a priest.

26
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,440
Poor thing.

27
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:32,003
<i>Deliver us from evil,
thrust it down to hell!</i>

28
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,173
<i>Hide me in your wound,</i>

29
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,300
<i>hold onto me,
so that I won't leave you.</i>

30
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,846
<i>Protect me from my enemies,
for all eternity until my death!</i>

31
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,451
Mom!

32
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,579
Father is weird!
Help me!

33
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,039
Ji-eun! Ji-eun!

34
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,253
Ji-eun! Baby...

35
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:20,886
What the hell did you do?!

36
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,138
What did you do to her!

37
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,307
Bring back my daughter!

38
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,560
Bring her back!

39
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:41,531
No!

40
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:00,509
Don't do this,
come back up...

41
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,136
Help me, Father...

42
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,972
This isn't me...

43
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:10,852
<i>We existed since God was born.</i>

44
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:15,315
<i>No, we existed before if was born.</i>

45
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,822
<i>As God exists everywhere,
we too exist everywhere,</i>

46
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:25,075
<i>and that is the will of your God.</i>

47
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,786
<i>God has forsaken you.</i>

48
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:32,290
I will come back to this world,

49
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:35,377
and tear your family's
flesh into pieces,

50
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:41,299
and send them to hell
where rats will devour them!

51
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:35,020
METAMORPHOSIS

52
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,837
<i>Locker owner should clean it up!
#pissoff #devil #gotohell</i>

53
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,177
So annoying...

54
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:11,431
Hyun-joo, I told you we should
look at the positive side.

55
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,016
How could I?

56
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:18,355
Why do we have to move
for something uncle did?

57
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,606
Park Hyun-joo!

58
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,983
She's not wrong.

59
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:26,029
From school to our home,
it was a headache.

60
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,158
What a hassle.

61
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:33,119
Honey, I apologized

62
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,747
That woman was the weird one.

63
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,917
She was begging to save
her dying daughter.

64
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:43,254
And when he tried,
she spread vicious rumors...

65
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,673
Sun-woo.

66
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,883
To be honest,

67
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:50,178
he was the last person
to see her alive.

68
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,222
He didn't allow her mom
to come in.

69
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,433
I can understand her
resenting him.

70
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,853
Will you stop saying that?

71
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:03,066
Why are you picking fight
with me? Am I wrong?

72
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:08,154
How could a girl who can't walk
jump out of the window?

73
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:09,489
- Hey!
- What?

74
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,282
What's with you two?

75
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,037
Let's just ride quietly.

76
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,248
Man...

77
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,480
Woo-jong, we're here,
wake up!

78
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,441
Wake up, baby,
we're here.

79
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,943
All right, let's hurry!

80
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,780
Good morning, sir.

81
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,407
- Good to see you.
- Hello there.

82
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,242
- Mr. Kim!
- Let's go inside.

83
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,164
Let's go.

84
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,290
Jeez...

85
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,420
Thank you.

86
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,262
Woo-jong, you'll get hurt.

87
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:19,267
Don't run,
you'll hurt yourself.

88
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,019
Take the chair to the room.

89
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,229
No, it's my chair.

90
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,148
You want my chair, huh?

91
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,275
How did you know?!

92
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,735
- Stop it!
- How did you know?!

93
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,070
Stop!

94
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,448
Hey! You're driving me crazy!

95
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,997
What's so good about moving?

96
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:43,458
Are you teasing me?

97
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,542
Hey, Hyun-joo!

98
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,839
Can't you see everyone
moving boxes?

99
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,759
No, it's nothing.

100
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,972
Did you see my IG?

101
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:02,393
Man, maybe I should go private.

102
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,571
Whatever, I don't want to
go to school.

103
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,491
You think I don't know?

104
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,201
Eun-ji and Bo-kyung, right?

105
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,246
I know!

106
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:25,125
They were sheep
when I was there,

107
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,626
now they're going wild.

108
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:33,133
Forget it! I don't care
what rumor they spread!

109
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,926
Being a loner is
worst it can happen.

110
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,637
Whatever! Don't even
mention my uncle!

111
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,014
Just thinking about it pisses me off.

112
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,183
You saw my locker!

113
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,398
Sun-woo!

114
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,569
Don't even dream
about meeting uncle.

115
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:53,695
Mom!

116
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,405
Listen to me when I tell you.

117
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,574
Do you understand?

118
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:02,078
I'm sick of churches, gods,
and everything else.

119
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,746
What's with you?

120
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,999
You shouldn't be like this.

121
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,752
I'm getting dad to return it to him,
so put it in the basement.

122
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,297
<i>Uncle Joong-su</i>

123
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:04,849
Honey.

124
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:06,976
Honey, wake up.

125
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,603
What is it?

126
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,940
Jeez...

127
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:19,739
What is that?

128
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,075
I don't know.

129
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,969
What's he doing at this hour?

130
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:42,887
Should I go talk to him?

131
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,014
What will you say to him?

132
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:48,351
I'll tell him that we can't sleep
because of him.

133
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:53,231
Don't make a scene
on our first day here.

134
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,024
Come.

135
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,645
You're so stubborn.

136
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,605
I said I'll do it after work.

137
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,442
Like hell you will.

138
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,736
Better for me to do it myself.

139
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,822
Got a welcome party today?

140
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,243
How did you know?

141
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,495
I'm gonna be late,
so don't wait up.

142
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,621
Lock up properly.

143
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,415
All done.

144
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,960
Sure, sure, don't be too late.

145
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:57,628
Hold on.

146
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:02,925
I thought a house bought
on auction would be bad,

147
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,305
but now that we're here,
I love it.

148
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,100
I know.

149
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,562
Why didn't anyone bid at all?

150
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,940
At least you stopped complaining.

151
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:26,032
Kids, dad's off to work!

152
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:29,660
Sun-woo! Hyun-joo!
Woo-jong!

153
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,580
Dad's off to work!

154
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,710
All right, bye.

155
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:38,961
- See you.
- Yeah.

156
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,713
- Have a good day.
- Okay.

157
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,383
- Bye.
- Okay.

158
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,013
Why didn't they come out
to see dad off?

159
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:51,224
I think Hyun-joo
isn't feeling well.

160
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,810
Or maybe she doesn't
want to go to school.

161
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,770
But she still has to go to school.

162
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:57,730
Hyun-joo!

163
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,358
- Hyun-joo!
- Watch out.

164
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,072
Dad!

165
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,953
- I'm off to work!
- Have fun!

166
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,079
Okay!

167
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,332
I'll save your spot!

00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,998
Uncle! Guess who?

171
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,916
Woo-jong!

172
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:02,211
We moved, did you know?

173
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,922
You did?

174
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:06,924
It's so cool here.

175
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:09,135
Really big and it has a yard too.

176
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:13,514
When will you come by?

177
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,517

180
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,736
but I do have to come by.

181
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,072

182
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,033
Would you like a toy?

183
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,077
Uncle, I gotta go!

184
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:40,791
Did you switch vocations?

185
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:43,794
Good morning.

186
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,880
The cabbages look really great.

187
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,924
It's almost kimchi season.

188
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:49,717
It's growing so well.

189
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,887
Why not spend the time to pray?

190
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,473
This is almost like praying.

191
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,643
Or expand the garden?

192
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,190
Father, what about my request...

193
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,776
to leave the priesthood?

194
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:10,905
As you know, removing
this robe isn't so easy.

195
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:14,575
Diocese hasn't approved it.

196
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:22,291
I don't know why you hold on
to an unholy priest.

197
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,543
Indeed.

198
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,674
Father Park.

199
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:36,389
You make unexpected turns
as you live your life, no?

200
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:41,644
If it's too much, how about
an overseas mission?

201
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:45,648
A way to forget the past
and get some fresh air.

202
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:50,736
Mom!

203
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,407
Woo-jong! Don't look at it!

204
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,493
- It's okay.
- Sun-woo, what is it?

205
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,331
What's the commotion?

206
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:05,334
It's nothing, go upstairs.

207
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,254
Hyun-joo?

208
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:11,757
- Hyun-joo!
- Hey!

209
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,009
- Hyun-joo!
- You okay?

210
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,135
Hyun-joo!

211
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,304
Sun-woo, call 911,
right now!

212
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,471
- Okay...
- Hurry!

213
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:21,601
Hyun-joo, baby?

214
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,152
Honey!

215
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:33,029
Dad...

216
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,905
- Over here.
- How is she?

217
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:36,866
What did the doctor say?

218
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,618
He said she's got cold,

219
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,996
it must be from stress
over the move.

220
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,453
How could he...

221
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,626
Go inside, it's raining.

222
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:29,752
What will you do?

223
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,879
I gotta get him to
move the truck!

224
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:35,341
And look! He smashed
Woo-jong's chair!

225
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,052
I knew he was up to no good.

226
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,137
I'll go give him hell!

227
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:42,181
Hyun-joo's not well,
let's just go inside.

228
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,725
Dad, let's go inside,
you can park elsewhere.

229
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:45,893
Yeah.

230
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:48,479
No, you go inside.

231
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,649
- Honey.
- Dad!

232
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:56,922
Anyone home?

233
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,218
Hello?

234
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:18,944
Is anyone home?

235
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,709
What're all these...

236
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:01,922
We're your new neighbors...

237
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:07,386
The thing is...

238
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:14,310
If you park like that...

239
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:59,313
It's driving me nuts...

240
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,399
Honey.

241
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,153
Honey?

242
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:07,071
Yeah?

243
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,490
You look completely out of it.

244
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:13,702
You said you talked
to the neighbor.

245
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:18,415
The neighbor is...

246
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,418
Mom...

247
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:23,712
Jeez, you startled me.

248
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:27,049
Yes, baby?

249
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,592
What is that sound?

250
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,388
I can't sleep at all.

251
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:40,604
Mom...

252
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,106
Woo-jong, come here.

253
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,274
Come here.

254
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:49,071
- Do you hear that too?
- Yeah...

255
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:59,164
Who makes fabric at night?

256
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,791
Like hell that was fabric.

257
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,418
It wasn't that at all.

258
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,628
I'm sorry for all the noise.

259
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,966
You didn't even greet me earlier,
Why bother now?

260
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,510
You two should make nice.

261
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:15,264
Nice? Do you know what he did?

262
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,767
He hung a dead cat
outside my window!

263
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:19,518
What?

264
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,771
What does he mean?

265
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:27,484
Well, I don't quite know
what he means...

266
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,738
Really?
This guy is a real bastard!

267
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:34,658
Hold on a second,
I was gonna let this go.

268
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,577
Here, take a look at this!

269
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:40,205
My kid was scared to death
but she still took it.

270
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,542
Does this make sense to you?

271
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:47,129
Is there proof that he did it?

272
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:51,800
Of course, take a look
inside his home!

273
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,428
Would it be possible
to check your home?

274
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:57,723
See? He became a mute!

275
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,308
That's enough.

276
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,769
May we go inside?

277
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:03,729
Sure.

278
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,943
You'll flip out when you go inside.

279
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:13,947
- Go back home.
- Honey...

280
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:15,240
Dad!

281
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,885
It's raining cats and dogs.

282
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:47,147
There isn't much here, sir.

283
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:48,524
Looks like it.

284
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,329
When did you clean up?

285
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:04,623
What's supposed to be here?

286
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,333
I only see piles of fabric.

287
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,961
So the noise came from this?

288
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:13,549
You really should work
during the day.

289
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,385
Think of the residents
who can't sleep because of it.

290
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,511
Yes, I understand.

291
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,390
Wait a minute.

292
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:25,310
I saw it in the afternoon!

293
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:28,272
Go check upstairs
and look around!

294
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,816
Dead chickens were dripping blood,

295
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:33,861
he skinned animals
and hung them here!

296
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,445
Will you stop it?

297
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:38,490
He already admitted his wrong,
what else is there?

298
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:42,161
- Let's go.
- Sure.

299
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:43,453
Excuse me!

300
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,218
- Honey
- Dad!

301
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:02,639
Keep your doors locked
or something bad will happen!

302
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:05,851
Go home please,
it was nothing!

303
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,353
- Jesus...
- Let's go.

304
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:10,856
- Thank you.
- Good night.

305
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:13,108
- Sir, shall we move out?
- Sure.

306
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:38,735
Father.

307
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:52,541
Father.

308
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,168
Father?

309
00:29:57,546 --> 00:30:00,424
<i>Your rage and tears
will build me up,</i>

310
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,968
<i>and your guilt will
breathe life into my veins,</i>

311
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:06,763
<i>so keep screaming louder!</i>

312
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:11,852
<i>Peace</i>

313
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,479
Woo-jong!

314
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:24,192
Stop fooling around.

315
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,362
I'm gonna destroy all your toys.

316
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:32,617
Woo-jong.

317
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:47,966
Dad?

318
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,595
What's wrong?

319
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,363
My little girl's all grown up.

320
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:01,623
Mom?

321
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:10,340
Is she mad?

322
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:12,968
Whatever, don't talk to me.

323
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,012
I'm having a bad day.

324
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:22,227
My sisters, morning.

325
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,396
Did you sleep well?

326
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:25,772
Eye booger.

327
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:28,358
Good morning!

328
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:29,693
- Morning, kids!
- Good morning.

329
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,152
Morning.

330
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:34,489
Honey, weren't you going out
to meet your friends?

331
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:39,035
Maybe not?

332
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:46,293
What is it?

333
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:48,169
Got something to say to me?

334
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,215
Hyun-joo!

335
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,596
What's with her again?

336
00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:59,097
I don't know.

337
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,433
Here it comes.

338
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:03,602
Honey.

339
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,403
Let's eat.

340
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:16,323
- Thank you for breakfast.
- Thank you.

341
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:34,966
Eat.

342
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:46,102
So salty,
it tastes weird today.

343
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:02,577
Honey!

344
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,461
It's not salty at all.

345
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,964
Stop complaining and eat.

346
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:17,509
Dad, what's wrong with mom?

347
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,678
Go on.

348
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:25,558
Don't eat if you don't want to.

349
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,313
Honey.

350
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:41,908
It tastes weird?

351
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:47,706
How dare you complain
when I said it's fine?

352
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:51,501
Do you even know
how I raised you?

353
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:57,257
I'm just skin and bones
raising you all!

354
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:00,969
Why? Why? Why!

355
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,596
Why do you not listen,
you bastards!

356
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,599
Honey! What's with you?

357
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:15,024
Mom, I'm sorry...

358
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,748
Woo-jong, don't cry,
it's all right.

359
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,294
Father Choi told me,

360
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,421
that you volunteered for
overseas mission.

361
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:39,090
It's not volunteer per se,

362
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,760
everyone's uneasy,
and I need to cool off...

363
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:48,057
I'll finish my classes,
so don't worry.

364
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,560
That's good.

365
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:54,606
At least you'll say good bye
to your pupils.

366
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:57,442
They all love your classes.

367
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:00,862
Oh, by the way...

368
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,832
This belonged to Ji-eun.

369
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,001
Her mother came by.

370
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:17,921
She wanted to forgive you.

371
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:21,633
She also apologized for
spreading rumors.

372
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:26,554
She said you should let it go,
and start anew.

373
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,853
How could I ever let it go?

374
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:38,608
A foolish priest couldn't protect
a girl whom she relied on,

375
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,905
and a parent lost her child.

376
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:17,772
Honey, I'm home.

377
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:19,357
You're home early.

378
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,442
Welcome back.

379
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:35,999
Honey.

380
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,126
Why did you do that
this morning?

381
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,586
What? This morning?

382
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:43,464
During breakfast,
why did you scold Woo-jong?

383
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:47,886
What do you mean?
I went to meet Se-jung.

384
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:50,513
I told you I was seeing her
in the morning.

385
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,103
Why? Did something happen?

386
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:02,942
It's nothing.

387
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,822
Come on.

388
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:17,206
Honey, look,
it's so funny!

389
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,699
Who is it?

390
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:04,087
Holy cow.

391
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:07,465
You scared me.

392
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,053
What's with you?

393
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:15,515
Aren't you sick and tired
of your siblings?

394
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,350
They don't die off.

395
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:20,228
What did you just say?

396
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:24,107
Why did goddamn parents
breed like rabbits?

397
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:26,818
Big burden, right?

398
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:30,697
Don't you want to
wipe them off like shit?

399
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:40,957
Just kill us,
kill us all.

400
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:44,502
Hyun-joo...

401
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:10,695
Hyun-joo!

402
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:12,739
Open the door!

403
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,368
What was that just now?

404
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,788
Just now? I was here
the whole time.

405
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,081
What?

406
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:31,716
I'm glad you're here.

407
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:42,810
Could you sleep with me tonight?

408
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:46,689
- Last night...
- You don't remember?

409
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:50,151
Sun-woo, what are you
talking about?

410
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,112
Did something happen
to you too? Like mom and dad?

411
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:54,197
Park Hyun-joo!

412
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:56,699
Do you even know
what dad did last night?

413
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,827
He did something bad to me...

414
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,289
He pulled my sheets,
and stared at me...

415
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:06,042
No way, did you dream it?

416
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:07,960
It was real!

417
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:11,297
You saw mom in the morning...

418
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:15,593
I think everyone's gone crazy.

419
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:22,225
What do you mean?

420
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:26,562
Answer me!

421
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:33,820
Bitches, do you know
how I raised you?

422
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:36,447
Dad?

423
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:46,791
Dad...

424
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:50,253
What are you accusing me of?

425
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:00,263
Hyun-joo!

426
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:11,482
Sun-woo!

427
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:17,363
Sun-woo...

428
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:25,830
Do I scare you?

429
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:36,591
Sis...

430
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,427
Sun-woo! Sis!

431
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:11,370
Hyun-joo!

432
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,165
Hyun-joo!

433
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:30,222
Hyun-joo.

434
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:33,517
Where are you?

435
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:53,704
Stop it!

436
00:48:08,177 --> 00:48:08,886
Hyun-joo!

437
00:48:08,928 --> 00:48:10,262
Hyun-joo, Sun-woo!

438
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:12,473
What's going on?

439
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:37,623
Sun-woo...

440
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:41,627
What's with you two?

441
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:56,308
What happened here?

442
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:02,481
Did you two fight?

443
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:06,610
What's wrong with you?

444
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:11,407
Dad...

445
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:13,159
Woo-jong...

446
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,702
Why aren't you all sleeping?

447
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:17,746
Your sisters...

448
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:18,831
Go inside...

449
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:23,752
Mom.

450
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:27,423
Honey.

451
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:35,097
What's with the hammer?

452
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:38,809
Mom, dad is...

453
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,436
Honey!

454
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:43,689
What's with you?!

455
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:46,025
Are you nuts?!

456
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:47,818
- Woo-jong!
- What's wrong?!

457
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,782
Honey!

458
00:49:58,245 --> 00:49:59,580
Stop!

459
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:11,926
What is the matter with you?!

460
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:30,569
What's going on?

461
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:39,787
What happened?

462
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:42,581
Did something happen?

463
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,501
What's with your arm?
Are you hurt?

464
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:47,878
What's with you?

465
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:05,271
Girls?

466
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:07,731
Why are you on the floor?

467
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:10,359
Hyun-joo.

468
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:11,610
Sun-woo...

469
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:29,336
<i>Become our refuge
from the devil's tricks.</i>

470
00:51:29,587 --> 00:51:36,051
<i>Almighty Lord,
holy Saint and savior!</i>

471
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:41,932
<i>Do not hand this child
to the darkness.</i>

472
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,059
<i>Leave at once, Malpas!</i>

473
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:52,067
<i>Baltazar! Who are you
telling to leave?!</i>

474
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:55,696
<i>I am this boy!</i>

475
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:10,794
<i>In the name of Jesus Christ!</i>

476
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:14,840
<i>We expel you from the body
of this sheep, vanish to hell!</i>

477
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:23,682
Father!

478
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:34,360
How was it?

479
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:37,488
The exorcised victim's
name was Jacob.

480
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:41,200
He was an ordinary
19-year old student.

481
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:43,202
And a faithful Catholic.

482
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:50,125
Unfortunately, his parents died
in a hit-and-run accident.

483
00:52:51,627 --> 00:52:56,048
He must've been in pain
and so much sorrow, right?

484
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:59,134
The devil targeted Jacob
in this state.

485
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:03,013
We succeeded in the end,
but compared to others,

486
00:53:03,055 --> 00:53:05,808
it was an extremely difficult exorcism.

487
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:10,062
His anger within was considerable.

488
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:11,563
- Father.
- Yes?

489
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:17,695
Why does the devil always
target those with pent-up anger?

490
00:53:18,237 --> 00:53:23,325
Anger paralyzes reason,
creates resentment towards God,

491
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:27,538
it is the easiest emotion
to make you lose yourself.

492
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:33,252
Which makes it even more
optimal to become the devil's target.

493
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,508
But the problem is,

494
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:44,221
whatever it is,
and what purpose it serves,

495
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:49,268
it uses and fools with
its human host,

496
00:53:50,686 --> 00:53:52,187
and ultimately,

497
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:54,815
the host dies,

498
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:59,403
and only the devil remains.

499
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:03,490
- Thank you.
- Good-bye

500
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:04,992
Good-bye

501
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:10,789
Thank you.

502
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:13,709
Oh my, look who it is.

503
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:15,753
Uncle, have you been well?

504
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:17,296
Hi, Sun-woo,
are you doing well?

505
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:21,967
I'm sorry for calling all of sudden.

506
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:26,680
But I think there's something
weird happening at our home.

507
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:28,640
Something weird?

508
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:32,853
Let me talk to him.

509
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:40,194
- Joong-su.
- Hey.

510
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:42,780
As you've heard from Sun-woo,

511
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:45,449
I think we need your help.

512
00:54:45,908 --> 00:54:46,784
I...

513
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:49,495
The situation is grave,
so you should come...

514
00:54:49,578 --> 00:54:50,454
I'm sorry...

515
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,583
but there's nothing I can do.

516
00:54:56,168 --> 00:54:57,628
I don't know what's going on...

517
00:54:57,753 --> 00:55:00,881
Joong-su, why don't we
chat in person?

518
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:02,466
I'm leaving Korea...

519
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:05,052
tonight.

520
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:10,641
What is it?

521
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:14,853
Okay, be well then.

522
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,065
Don't be sick.

523
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:20,400
- Dad...
- Let's talk again.

524
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:46,885
How could you hang up like that?
We got no plan.

525
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:48,720
Where is he?

526
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,723
I'll go convince him,
give me the phone.

527
00:55:52,558 --> 00:55:53,809
That's enough.

528
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:56,645
What's with you?

529
00:55:58,856 --> 00:56:01,358
Is it because of your pride?

530
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:04,444
We don't know what'll
happen to our family.

531
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:08,991
And how could he
do this to us?

532
00:56:09,283 --> 00:56:10,909
He forgot how we provided for him?

533
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,828
Stop, that's enough!

534
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:15,539
How could you be so brazen?

535
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:17,291
Brazen?

536
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,503
Does he even know what we
went through because of him?

537
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:24,214
Whose fault is it that
we're in this hell?!

538
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:27,342
Myung-joo! I'm glad
you brought it up!

539
00:56:27,593 --> 00:56:30,095
So why did we move here?

540
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:34,516
When you wanted to move here,
I didn't object, why?

541
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:40,147
You said you were
suffocating to death there!

542
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:42,816
So it was all me?

543
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:47,362
Sun-woo left school
because of it,

544
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,866
and Hyun-joo was bullied
at her school!

545
00:56:50,991 --> 00:56:53,160
I didn't want to tell you
for your sake.

546
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:57,205
Do you think
it was so easy for me?!

547
00:56:57,289 --> 00:56:58,749
She's right.

548
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:03,462
It was so hard on us,
I'm so disappointed in uncle.

549
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:05,172
I don't want him
to come either!

550
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:08,300
What happened to that girl
could happen again.

551
00:57:09,176 --> 00:57:11,303
Hyun-joo, I told you to
watch your mouth.

552
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:12,346
Can't I talk?

553
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:15,349
You're the only one suffering?

554
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:17,184
It's always like this.

555
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:21,563
You always play the good guy,
and I'm the bitch, right?

556
00:57:21,897 --> 00:57:24,650
All right, I'll play along
and give him a call.

557
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,902
How can he be a priest
and be so ungrateful?

558
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:31,657
Let me call him,
give me your phone!

559
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:38,372
You didn't think I wouldn't know
how he always sent you rents?

560
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:43,293
You took his money,
and say he's ungrateful?

561
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:47,547
Honestly, have you ever
cooked him a hot meal?!

562
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:50,008
All you did was pressure him.

563
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:55,055
You can't do this
after what you did to him.

564
00:57:55,222 --> 00:57:57,683
What? Did I hear that right?

565
00:57:58,058 --> 00:57:59,935
Please stop it.

566
00:58:01,353 --> 00:58:03,397
This isn't the time
for you two to fight!

567
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,193
Mom...

568
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:38,724
Uncle, I didn't get to tell you this,

569
00:58:40,809 --> 00:58:44,104
there were 2 dads last night...

570
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:14,968
- Mom...
- Please.

571
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:16,094
Mom!

572
00:59:17,304 --> 00:59:19,097
- What's with you?
- Mom.

573
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:22,476
Please don't do this.

574
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:25,687
You should pack up too.

575
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:27,147
Woo-jong, let's go.

576
00:59:27,189 --> 00:59:28,440
Where would you go?

577
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:32,069
Hyun-joo, what are you doing?

578
00:59:32,736 --> 00:59:34,321
I can't stay here another day.

579
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:37,616
Don't do this,
this is our home.

580
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:40,535
Then do you have a plan?
I can't sleep here.

581
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:41,369
Sun-woo...

582
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:50,378
Uncle...

583
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:52,798
Uncle!

584
00:59:56,176 --> 00:59:57,344
I missed you.

585
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:58,887
Have you been well?

586
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:00,514
You came...

587
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:02,099
Myung-joo, how are you?

588
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:05,185
The gate was opened,
so I just came in.

589
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:16,238
I see.

590
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:19,116
So that's what happened...

591
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:20,909
Yeah...

592
01:00:21,493 --> 01:00:23,328
It bothered me when we moved,

593
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:28,750
I don't know what he does,
but there's a lot of strange noises.

594
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:33,588
I think it's best that
we stay together tonight.

595
01:00:34,923 --> 01:00:36,925
So we're all sleeping together?

596
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:39,928
Then sleep next to me, okay?

597
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:45,183
All right, let's all sleep together.

598
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:52,370
I will come back to this world,

599
01:03:52,871 --> 01:03:55,623
and tear your family's
flesh into pieces,

600
01:03:55,790 --> 01:04:00,879
and send them to hell
where rats will devour them!

601
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:10,221
All you did was pray
and say a few words.

602
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:13,183
How could you feeble being
do anything?

603
01:04:14,726 --> 01:04:16,436
You poor thing.

604
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:10,990
Sun-woo, I have to pee...

605
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:17,247
Hyun-joo...

606
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:18,832
Dammit...

607
01:06:09,841 --> 01:06:11,009
Hey, Woo-jong.

608
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:13,344
Go back to sleep if you're done.

609
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:16,473
Don't move around.

610
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:46,336
This life was the light
of the human race.

611
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:49,714
The light shines in the darkness,

612
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:54,677
and the darkness has not
overcome it.

613
01:06:55,595 --> 01:06:58,389
The Lord be with you.

614
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,892
And also with you.

615
01:07:01,309 --> 01:07:07,857
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit,

616
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:10,693
amen.

617
01:07:10,777 --> 01:07:13,530
Thanks be to God.

618
01:07:15,823 --> 01:07:16,950
Father?

619
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:21,579
Father.

620
01:07:24,666 --> 01:07:26,918
You have a call,
and it seems important.

621
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,628
I think you should take it.

622
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:38,179
- Joong-su?
- Have you been well?

623
01:07:38,263 --> 01:07:40,181
I'm sorry I haven't been in touch.

624
01:07:40,223 --> 01:07:42,934
I know you well enough,
I didn't expect much.

625
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:45,562
According to the rumor mill,

626
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:48,064
you volunteered to
overseas mission.

627
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:58,658
Looks like you haven't escaped
from guilty conscience.

628
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:00,660
Your nagging hasn't changed.

629
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,663
I imagine you didn't call
to say hello,

630
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:07,333
did something happen?

631
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:12,046
It can't be Satan,
he's got precise movement.

632
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:13,423
And he has a shadow.

633
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:15,925
Are you blind?
Where is the shadow?

634
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:19,679
Is there any manipulation
or synthesis?

635
01:08:20,138 --> 01:08:23,891
It's from Father Baltazar's disciple!
There's no reason to doubt it.

636
01:08:24,017 --> 01:08:26,769
Shouldn't we be
a little bit more suspicious?

637
01:08:26,853 --> 01:08:29,314
You know, there are
a lot of times like this.

638
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,482
Don't worry about it,
the video is real.

639
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:34,110
Are you sure that's the real Satan?

640
01:08:36,237 --> 01:08:42,076
Have you forgotten?
The Satan can change appearances.

641
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:43,494
He's correct!

642
01:08:43,745 --> 01:08:47,790
The devil keeps changing appearances.

643
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:50,418
In Genesis, he was a snake.

644
01:08:50,752 --> 01:08:53,963
In one of my exorcisms,
he was a goat.

645
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:59,510
And he manipulates people,
so that they hate each other.

646
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:02,513
God, you make it sound like
you've seen it all.

647
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:03,473
- Father.
- Father...

648
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:04,515
Excuse me, Father.

649
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:08,811
Are you trying to say that
all my exorcism stories are lies?

650
01:09:09,228 --> 01:09:12,732
But it's stupid to believe
all your stories for no reason.

651
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:14,567
But it cut my hand!

652
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:17,236
So that I wouldn't be able to
pray any longer.

653
01:09:17,362 --> 01:09:22,200
Had the devil wanted you to stop praying,
he would've cut off your tongue!

654
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:23,618
Let's be civil now, Father.

655
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:29,374
Father, an exorcist must have
actual experiences.

656
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:32,585
He can't just sit in a church,
and read the bible!

657
01:09:33,211 --> 01:09:34,087
Are you done?

658
01:09:34,253 --> 01:09:35,338
No, I'm not done.

659
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:51,437
I installed a security camera last night.

660
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:53,481
Sorry for not telling you.

661
01:09:54,232 --> 01:09:57,944
It's hard to believe but
something else was here.

662
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:00,488
So what do we do?

663
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:02,532
It's already inside the house.

664
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:07,787
It took his form last night,
but it could be anyone next.

665
01:10:09,372 --> 01:10:13,042
I think we'll need to
perform an exorcism.

666
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:16,129
That's the only way...

667
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:22,760
Don't worry,
I won't do it.

668
01:10:25,555 --> 01:10:27,265
I asked someone I trust to do it.

669
01:10:29,392 --> 01:10:32,270
By the way, why aren't there
any crosses in here?

670
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:37,275
We haven't fully unpacked yet.

671
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:40,027
They're probably in
the basement.

672
01:10:40,194 --> 01:10:41,320
Then...

673
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:48,411
Sun-woo, could you get crosses
and statues of Virgin Mary?

674
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:53,666
You took them downstairs.

675
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:57,003
What?

676
01:10:57,211 --> 01:11:00,256
Say you don't want to,
don't play dumb.

677
01:11:01,048 --> 01:11:02,341
I'll get them.

678
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:04,385
Thank you, Hyun-joo.

679
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:07,722
It's not urgent,
do it later.

680
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:10,057
Okay.

681
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:22,278
Listen carefully.

682
01:11:23,863 --> 01:11:26,824
Sun-woo is the one.

683
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:30,119
To be preside, it has assumed
Sun-woo's form.

684
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:33,122
I added holy water
to your water.

685
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:39,253
She was the only one
who didn't drink it earlier.

686
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:41,839
It knew it has holy water.

687
01:11:43,257 --> 01:11:44,759
What about Sun-woo?

688
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:47,553
If we act too hastily,
it will clue in.

689
01:11:47,595 --> 01:11:50,973
So until Father Baltazar arrives,

690
01:11:52,058 --> 01:11:53,184
let's wait patiently.

691
01:11:53,935 --> 01:11:55,937
You must keep an eye on her.

692
01:11:57,021 --> 01:11:58,481
You want me to
keep an eye on her?

693
01:11:59,106 --> 01:12:02,527
For some reason, he asked me
pick him up at the airport.

694
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:05,988
I'll come back soon,
so don't worry.

695
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:10,201
You must watch her carefully,
understand?

696
01:12:11,118 --> 01:12:12,245
Yeah.

697
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:26,676
Father!

698
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:33,307
It must've been a tiring flight.

699
01:12:33,933 --> 01:12:35,935
I'm sorry for this difficult favor.

700
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:37,520
No need.

701
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:42,900
Say hello, these are
my assistants.

702
01:12:47,864 --> 01:12:53,160
Did you come here because
you thought I'd get lost?

703
01:12:54,579 --> 01:12:56,873
You asked me to
pick you up at the airport.

704
01:12:57,665 --> 01:13:01,127
What do you mean?
When did I?

705
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:14,348
There's no signal.

706
01:14:48,526 --> 01:14:49,527
Hyun-joo!

707
01:14:53,072 --> 01:14:54,073
Sun-woo...

708
01:15:07,253 --> 01:15:08,337
Hyun-joo!

709
01:16:09,356 --> 01:16:10,357
Father!

710
01:16:21,368 --> 01:16:22,661
What's with that van?

711
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:48,896
Listen carefully.

712
01:16:49,188 --> 01:16:51,190
Sun-woo is the one.

713
01:16:53,234 --> 01:16:54,527
The devil.

714
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,002
Sun-woo?

715
01:17:12,878 --> 01:17:13,879
Yeah?

716
01:17:15,673 --> 01:17:16,632
Where are you going?

717
01:17:16,715 --> 01:17:18,551
Hyun-joo said the gate won't open.

718
01:17:19,093 --> 01:17:21,220
- Hyun-joo?
- Yeah.

719
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:23,389
I'll open it then.

720
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:25,474
No, I'll go.

721
01:17:28,102 --> 01:17:29,311
Sweetie.

722
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:38,070
Don't ever let it
out of the house.

723
01:18:30,247 --> 01:18:31,373
Father...

724
01:18:34,668 --> 01:18:35,753
Sir!

725
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:09,370
What are you doing?

726
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:12,414
- Stay outside.
- I can't!

727
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:15,668
What are you doing to Sun-Woo?!

728
01:19:15,876 --> 01:19:19,088
Honey, according to Joong-su,

729
01:19:19,338 --> 01:19:23,425
this is not our daughter.

730
01:19:23,884 --> 01:19:27,638
It's obvious this is Sun-woo,
how does he know?

731
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:31,684
I don't know,
I don't really know!

732
01:19:32,226 --> 01:19:34,853
But what can I do?
I gotta listen to him.

733
01:19:38,941 --> 01:19:39,733
Honey.

734
01:19:41,902 --> 01:19:47,783
If something happens to
our kids, can you manage?

735
01:19:50,703 --> 01:19:52,371
I'm so scared...

736
01:19:56,583 --> 01:20:00,004
It'll be all right,
just get through tonight...

737
01:20:02,756 --> 01:20:04,383
It'll be fine.

738
01:20:24,945 --> 01:20:28,157
Mom, where did uncle go?

739
01:20:29,033 --> 01:20:30,242
Why isn't he coming?

740
01:20:31,618 --> 01:20:35,831
He went out for a bit,
he'll be back.

741
01:20:42,087 --> 01:20:43,130
Hyun-joo...

742
01:20:49,219 --> 01:20:50,387
Mom?

743
01:20:50,471 --> 01:20:52,639
She went down to the basement...

744
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:54,641
Myung-joo!

745
01:20:59,063 --> 01:21:00,314
Joong-su!

746
01:21:01,565 --> 01:21:03,067
Where's Sun-woo?

747
01:21:08,947 --> 01:21:11,575
Uncle, please stop dad!

748
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:13,202
Joong-su!

749
01:21:14,036 --> 01:21:15,996
Uncle, untie me!

750
01:21:19,124 --> 01:21:20,376
Joong-su,

751
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:24,630
what happened to you?

752
01:21:25,422 --> 01:21:31,053
I think we should delay
the exorcism...

753
01:21:31,512 --> 01:21:33,222
What are you saying?

754
01:21:33,263 --> 01:21:35,224
What about your guests?

755
01:21:35,933 --> 01:21:37,684
We got into an accident.

756
01:21:38,852 --> 01:21:40,521
Only I managed to survive.

757
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:41,480
Then...

758
01:21:43,107 --> 01:21:45,067
Then what do we do?

759
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,701
You can do it yourself.

760
01:21:54,785 --> 01:21:58,705
Listen to yourself,
have you forgotten?

761
01:21:59,748 --> 01:22:01,417
A person died because of me.

762
01:22:01,667 --> 01:22:03,085
It doesn't matter.

763
01:22:03,544 --> 01:22:06,797
You said she's not my daughter.

764
01:22:07,506 --> 01:22:11,093
And you said this is the only way.

765
01:22:14,638 --> 01:22:16,014
I can't...

766
01:22:19,143 --> 01:22:23,105
What if we delay the exorcism,

767
01:22:23,981 --> 01:22:26,275
and my family dies,
what happens then?

768
01:22:26,316 --> 01:22:28,026
I can't do this!

769
01:22:35,576 --> 01:22:36,910
What am I?

770
01:22:38,704 --> 01:22:40,706
Kang-gu...

771
01:22:42,416 --> 01:22:44,126
Am I not family too?

772
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:52,509
I don't give a damn
about your guilt.

773
01:22:52,843 --> 01:22:55,345
So do something,
you bastard!

774
01:23:02,019 --> 01:23:03,353
I'm sorry...

775
01:23:07,357 --> 01:23:08,442
I really am...

776
01:23:21,163 --> 01:23:23,999
I'm begging you...

777
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:28,879
Please help us.

778
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:31,423
I'm begging you.

779
01:23:32,799 --> 01:23:37,763
Help us just this once, please...

780
01:23:38,305 --> 01:23:39,473
Please...

781
01:23:40,933 --> 01:23:43,018
Please help us...

782
01:23:45,312 --> 01:23:46,522
Please...

783
01:24:01,662 --> 01:24:05,874
It will mimic Sun-woo
and beg to let it go,

784
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:07,125
but don't listen to it,
nor believe it.

785
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:09,836
- What do you mean?
- Got it?

786
01:24:10,128 --> 01:24:11,505
It's me...

787
01:24:21,807 --> 01:24:23,308
Dad, untie me.

788
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:35,445
Mom, please, untie me...

789
01:24:54,047 --> 01:24:55,299
Uncle...

790
01:25:05,851 --> 01:25:08,812
What's wrong with you?!
I'm Sun-woo!

791
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:10,981
Kang-gu.

792
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:13,984
Hold her legs.

793
01:25:17,654 --> 01:25:18,655
Go on.

794
01:25:19,698 --> 01:25:21,575
We might not get her back.

795
01:25:22,659 --> 01:25:23,827
Dad!

796
01:25:28,165 --> 01:25:31,335
Dad, please...

797
01:25:31,418 --> 01:25:33,003
No, don't do this...

798
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:36,632
I'm sorry...

799
01:25:39,009 --> 01:25:42,220
Dad, I'm really sorry...

800
01:25:42,346 --> 01:25:44,681
I'm sorry!

801
01:26:08,747 --> 01:26:10,082
Mom! Mom!

802
01:26:19,508 --> 01:26:20,801
Get a stretcher!

803
01:26:36,316 --> 01:26:39,069
It's open! Get a stretcher!

804
01:26:42,364 --> 01:26:43,949
Be careful!

805
01:26:45,325 --> 01:26:47,744
Go slow, easy!

806
01:26:47,828 --> 01:26:48,995
One, two, three!

807
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:52,040
Chief!

808
01:26:53,375 --> 01:26:54,251
What?!

809
01:26:56,294 --> 01:26:57,421
Over here!

810
01:27:01,591 --> 01:27:03,093
- Chief, take a look.
- What?

811
01:27:07,681 --> 01:27:08,890
What is it?

812
01:27:13,145 --> 01:27:14,771
There's someone here!

813
01:27:15,272 --> 01:27:17,858
Medic! Medic!

814
01:27:39,713 --> 01:27:42,299
Stop! Stop!

815
01:27:42,591 --> 01:27:44,009
No! That's enough!

816
01:27:44,134 --> 01:27:46,595
No more! Stop it!

817
01:27:49,306 --> 01:27:51,683
You're her dad!

818
01:27:52,601 --> 01:27:56,438
Why, why can't you tell?!

819
01:27:56,688 --> 01:27:59,816
No, honey, he said
this isn't our daughter.

820
01:28:01,318 --> 01:28:03,737
No, I don't want to do this!

821
01:28:04,029 --> 01:28:06,114
Honey, please, let's stop.

822
01:28:06,198 --> 01:28:08,992
Please stop...

823
01:28:09,534 --> 01:28:10,952
Mom...

824
01:28:11,495 --> 01:28:12,454
Sun-woo...

825
01:28:13,330 --> 01:28:15,332
I'm so sorry, baby.

826
01:28:15,373 --> 01:28:18,293
If you won't help,
stay outside!

827
01:28:21,630 --> 01:28:22,506
Get out...

828
01:28:23,715 --> 01:28:25,717
You're a worthless parent...

829
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:29,513
incompetent, and a coward.

830
01:28:31,014 --> 01:28:34,267
You thought you could
protect your family?

831
01:28:43,109 --> 01:28:46,947
You're not my wife...

832
01:28:47,864 --> 01:28:50,075
How dare you mimic my wife,

833
01:28:50,784 --> 01:28:52,619
and try to kill my girl?!

834
01:28:53,537 --> 01:28:55,747
You demonic bitch!

835
01:30:21,541 --> 01:30:22,584
Woo-jong...

836
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:25,003
Get away!

837
01:30:34,596 --> 01:30:35,639
Woo-jong...

838
01:30:36,139 --> 01:30:37,349
Get away...

839
01:30:39,267 --> 01:30:40,685
Get out of here!

840
01:31:03,833 --> 01:31:04,834
Lord!

841
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,212
Do not be fooled by
deceitful eyes and tongue,

842
01:31:07,379 --> 01:31:10,173
stop the blood flowing
on the innocent's limbs,

843
01:31:10,215 --> 01:31:11,841
and save us from evil!

844
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:14,427
- We beg of you...
- Shit.

845
01:31:14,511 --> 01:31:17,806
Give us holy light to
shine the darkness,

846
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:20,767
- and give me mercy...
- Interesting.

847
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:22,811
- To this feeble pastor!
- Joong-su...

848
01:31:23,603 --> 01:31:25,563
Lord, expel evil for us!

849
01:31:45,709 --> 01:31:46,751
Kang-gu!

850
01:31:47,127 --> 01:31:48,128
Hey!

851
01:31:49,796 --> 01:31:50,630
Kang-gu!

852
01:31:59,973 --> 01:32:01,266
- Dad!
- Woo-jong.

853
01:32:02,392 --> 01:32:04,185
Joong-su, where is he?

854
01:32:04,394 --> 01:32:05,979
- Woo-jong!
- Dad!

855
01:32:07,105 --> 01:32:08,148
Woo-jong!

856
01:32:08,606 --> 01:32:09,566
Son!

857
01:32:11,026 --> 01:32:13,653
- Woo-jong!
- I'm sorry!

858
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:16,406
Woo-jong, it's okay,
it's uncle.

859
01:32:16,489 --> 01:32:18,158
- No, you're not uncle...
- Woo-jong!

860
01:32:19,409 --> 01:32:21,119
It's really him,
it's okay.

861
01:32:29,294 --> 01:32:31,713
But Hyun-joo...

862
01:32:59,282 --> 01:33:00,408
Hyun-joo...

863
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:21,805
Dad...

864
01:33:24,933 --> 01:33:26,142
Sun-woo!

865
01:33:39,823 --> 01:33:42,117
Why did you do that to me?

866
01:33:58,758 --> 01:34:00,802
Did you hurt Hyun-joo too?

867
01:34:03,721 --> 01:34:05,140
Sun-woo...

868
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:10,812
This is all my fault.

869
01:34:12,188 --> 01:34:16,234
How could I not
recognize my child?

870
01:34:18,611 --> 01:34:19,654
Dad...

871
01:34:21,573 --> 01:34:22,991
I'm sorry, Sun-woo...

872
01:34:37,213 --> 01:34:45,013
<i>Hear my prayer from depths
of heaven and hell.</i>

873
01:34:49,309 --> 01:34:50,226
Woo-jong!

874
01:34:50,435 --> 01:34:53,479
<i>Traitor of faith, Satan,
shiver in fear!</i>

875
01:34:54,564 --> 01:34:56,232
What's wrong, uncle?

876
01:34:57,609 --> 01:34:59,027
It's me, Sun-woo.

877
01:35:00,361 --> 01:35:01,738
Your niece.

878
01:35:06,951 --> 01:35:10,246
<i>Glory be to the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit,</i>

879
01:35:13,875 --> 01:35:17,462
<i>in the name of Jesus Christ,</i>

880
01:35:17,503 --> 01:35:20,381
<i>I have the power
to repel evil,</i>

881
01:35:20,715 --> 01:35:24,969
<i>you will not harm anyone!</i>

882
01:35:35,730 --> 01:35:37,690
Woo-jong, hide in there.

883
01:35:37,857 --> 01:35:38,983
Dad!

884
01:35:41,319 --> 01:35:42,654
Get in there.

885
01:35:54,499 --> 01:35:55,041
Joong-su!

886
01:35:55,083 --> 01:36:00,338
<i>I'll raise hell, burn your
dirty mouth and lock you up!</i>

887
01:36:22,777 --> 01:36:23,820
Joong-su!

888
01:36:40,003 --> 01:36:45,341
<i>Angels in heaven,
give me your power!</i>

889
01:36:45,425 --> 01:36:49,470
<i>Use me as a weapon
to ward off Satan!</i>

890
01:36:50,805 --> 01:36:53,599
Uncle, it hurts so much...

891
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:56,853
Father, please save me...

892
01:36:59,689 --> 01:37:00,982
It isn't me...

893
01:37:01,566 --> 01:37:04,360
Please save me...

894
01:38:03,294 --> 01:38:05,963
I'll show you
how feeble you all are.

895
01:38:14,138 --> 01:38:18,226
Tear your hearts out
and show them to me.

896
01:38:19,519 --> 01:38:21,354
Whose flock do you belong to?

897
01:38:22,063 --> 01:38:24,649
Kneel and worship me.

898
01:38:25,858 --> 01:38:30,113
I'll allow you to serve me
for an eternity.

899
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:35,660
God almighty
and my Father,

900
01:38:36,369 --> 01:38:38,079
give me the power

901
01:38:39,163 --> 01:38:41,707
to lock this demon in my body,

902
01:38:42,208 --> 01:38:46,504
make me the vessel,
beginning and end.

903
01:38:48,339 --> 01:38:51,926
Expel this old beast
into abyss,

904
01:38:52,468 --> 01:38:54,679
and do not let it temp others.

905
01:38:55,471 --> 01:39:02,353
Take my tainted body
and lock this demon up!

906
01:39:03,688 --> 01:39:04,772
