1
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:09,527
I am just sick and tired of hiding
and waiting in here so long...

2
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:11,488
Listen!

3
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:13,615
I'll get on the cargo ship
first thing in the morning

4
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:16,201
but you have to handle the
rest it over there for me.

5
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:17,703
Do you understand?

6
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:21,373
What? What do you mean I have to wait?

7
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:23,875
How many times have I told you?

8
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:25,878
I'll get blamed for everything!

9
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:29,298
It's all over the media!

10
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:34,220
<i>WOO-MYUNG GROUP'S
TAX EVASION CONFIRMED</i>

11
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:37,306
No no no no... Not China!
I wanna go to Vietnam...

12
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,194
Who the hell are you?

13
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:58,202
Mr. Jang Min-ki?

14
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,412
Right?

15
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:11,715
What the fuck are you doing?

16
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,304
Sit him up.

17
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,570
This will sting a bit.
Clench your fist, please.

18
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:50,588
Let's go, then.

19
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:53,465
Okay.

20
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,759
Got it.

21
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,472
Well...

22
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,727
This wasn't in the script. What do we do?

23
00:03:05,311 --> 00:03:07,897
What do you think? Rewrite the script.

24
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,356
<i>The CFO of Woo-Myung Group,

00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:53,650
<i>being summoned by prosecutors,</i>

00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:56,736
<i>has been found dead of a
heart attack in a Seoul hotel.</i>

27
00:03:56,737 --> 00:04:02,825
<i>The cause of death seems to be
a massive drug overdose...</i>

28
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:06,664
<i>Jang's death is expected to derail

29
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:09,667
<i>into tax evasion at Woo-Myung Group.</i>

30
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:24,490
Move orderly. Stay in line.

31
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,492
Let's get along well.

32
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,579
Eyes ahead! Move forward!

33
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:35,961
Oh, it's a death row convict!

34
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,505
You blockhead, death row is red.

35
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:42,759
Yellow is a person of interest.
Meaning he requires attention.

36
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,511
Best for us to leave him alone.

37
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,681
What are you looking at, fucker?

38
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:49,015
Don't stare.

39
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,099
Silence!

40
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,685
I'll dig your eyes out...

41
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:53,937
Damn it!

42
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:56,607
Let me go!

43
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,024
Let go!

44
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:01,945
Come here, you!

45
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:09,161
First bonehead to come in a while.

46
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:10,829
Seems that way.

47
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:14,958
He's even got forsythia on his chest.

48
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,089
You son of a bitch!

49
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:24,093
Haven't seen him before.
Where does he belong to?

50
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:30,515
Damn blockhead.

51
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:31,934
Get in!

52
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:34,018
Dammit!

53
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,770
Stay still!

54
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:36,939
Stay still, you bastards!

55
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,621
- Don't move.
- You might break your neck, prick!

56
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:57,959
Got it!

57
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,628
Yay, he's hanging!

58
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,014
You asshole.

59
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:15,686
- Hey, cut it out.
- Yes, boss!

60
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:17,938
I'm gonna sleep.

61
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,606
Put him there.

62
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:26,697
Good night, sir!

63
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,702
Fuck!

64
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,872
Why do I always need to
pee when I try to sleep?

65
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:37,541
I should see the doctor.

66
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:43,880
Having a hard time?

67
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:45,882
You should stay strong.

68
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:47,885
It's no fun like this, Lieutenant Song.

69
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,596
I know.

70
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:55,767
You never imagined sharing a cell
with a guy you threw in, I get that.

71
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:05,694
Are you laughing?

72
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,279
Is this funny?

73
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,198
You motherfucker!

74
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:12,201
What?

75
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,204
I don't understand a word, you asshole.

76
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,085
Long time ago...

77
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:23,754
What?

78
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:25,589
Long time ago...

79
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,926
What? Long time ago?

80
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,223
- Don't move!
- Where's the warden?

81
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:36,934
He's coming!

82
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:42,105
I asked for the warden.
Not all you scumbags!

83
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:46,025
I'll cut his throat!
It's your fault if he dies!

84
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,694
Bring the warden now!

85
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,947
This bastard is really insane!

86
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:12,635
Let me ask you. Whose idea was that?

87
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:15,054
You should be careful when playing tricks.

88
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:18,392
What did you expect me to
do among those bastards?

89
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:22,145
This tea is from Tibet.

90
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:25,691
It has a great scent. Enjoy.

91
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:28,859
I heard this place is tough as nails.

92
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,988
But you shouldn't do that to me.

93
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,991
I was a civil servant just like you.

94
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:39,037
You never know what might
happen to you someday.

95
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,874
Administering correctional
facilities isn't easy.

96
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,210
People locking up other people...

97
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,213
You talk through your ass.

98
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,633
You're not listening to me.

99
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,888
Put me in another cell.

100
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:59,725
Then I'll lie low until
I finish my sentence.

101
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:12,195
Challenging me is like punching a wall.

102
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,322
When I was in Go-chang Prison,

103
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:17,158
I made the chief of security
and one officer quit.

104
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:20,370
So don't provoke me.
Then I'll be calm and quiet.

105
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:29,880
Who lets inmates wander around at night?

106
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,215
What kind of prison is this?

107
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,135
Come here.

108
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,138
Come here, you bastard!

109
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,725
Stop right there!

110
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:43,894
Get over here!

111
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:50,817
It hurts... I had enough.

112
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,405
Let's stop this. Fuck!

113
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,896
Your eyes are

114
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,149
full of malice.

115
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:36,071
This place is tough.

116
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:39,950
If you run wild like this,

117
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:42,744
we'll wear each other out.

118
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:46,414
We need to rely on each other,

119
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,750
and help one another.

120
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:53,129
You and I are both fucking prisoners.

121
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,257
How dare you preach to me?

122
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:19,155
So, you lost your hand

123
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:22,159
working on this machine, okay?

124
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:23,910
Damn it.

125
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:27,914
Fuck, let's not do this!

126
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:34,254
Catch him!

127
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,220
No!

128
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:45,222
Hold on a second!

129
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:47,225
Please forgive me!

130
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,395
I'll do whatever you tell me!

131
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:13,084
You promised to behave.

132
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,346
You wet your pants.

133
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:36,566
Fuck.

134
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:43,989
No. 3260. 20 days' detention for
assault and damage to property.

135
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,158
Get in!

136
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,410
Hurry.

137
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,247
Don't push.

138
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,925
Who the hell was that anyway?

139
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,936
Fucking embarrassing.

140
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:50,265
Whoever gets on his bad
side is dead meat here.

141
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:52,225
Not even the warden can touch him.

142
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:55,185
Ik-ho is a troubleshooter.

143
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:58,188
So his word is law here.

144
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:01,651
To be honest, he makes our jobs easier.

145
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,488
Where does he belong to?

146
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:11,328
He doesn't belong to any gang.
He's above them.

147
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,162
You know the White Tiger gang?

148
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:16,624
The leader picked a fight with
Ik-ho and lost all his men to him.

149
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:22,005
Rumor says Ik-ho pulled his eye out
and chewed it in front of everyone.

150
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:23,923
Don't bullshit me!

151
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:27,010
Anyway, he's untouchable here.

152
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:29,679
He's the King.

153
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:33,015
Try going to house No. 8.
All his men are there.

154
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:35,268
We don't set a foot there.

155
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:40,106
If you can join that house,
prison life will be great.

00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:15,266
I heard your daughter's getting married?

159

You didn't have to...

160
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:22,607
We're all family here.

161
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:25,110
Congratulations, Chief Kwon.

162
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,529
By the way... hey!

163
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,698
Yes, sir!

164
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:37,121
Sir.

165
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:38,707
He has a situation...

166
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,418
What is it?

167
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:47,048
- My daughter is very sick...
- Transfer him...

168
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:49,718
Busan would be good.

169
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:54,723
Don't worry.

170
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:56,599
I can handle that.

171
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,520
I have a meeting now.

172
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,605
Thank you, Chief Kwon.

173
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,442
Thanks.

174
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,534
Guess that cop has quieted down?

175
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:19,204
He's a real badass, so we
need to keep an eye on him.

176
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:22,125
- Hit and run?
- Not just that.

177
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:26,713

00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:37,807
<i>That's why he has so many enemies.

181
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:45,189

00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:11,299
Who are you?

185
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,553
You don't even recognize your source?

186
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:20,141
Are you Gye-sik?
What happened to your face?

187
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:21,642
Look at yours.

188
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:25,146
I heard you came in here.

189
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:29,316
But I hardly recognize
you wearing this shit.

190
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,361
Hey, Lieutenant Song!

191
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:34,489
So you're out? Hard time in there?

192
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:38,159
We were fucking bored without you.

193
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:42,705
Hey, you should pay for my ear, fucker!

194
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:47,377
I ate it all up, asshole.
Go search in the toilet.

195
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,878
Back off, you two!

196
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,630
Tonight's gonna be special.

197
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:55,218
You'll watch the sunrise with
blood seeping out your asshole.

198
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,638
I told you, back off! You
want to go into solitary?

199
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:05,979
I told you to stop!

200
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:25,290
You used to be a gangster,
but you're turning into a bully.

201
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:29,586
Watch your language. My boys are here.

202
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:34,757
Ordering your men to bully others,
that's what a bully does.

203
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,720
Instead,

204
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:41,723
how about a fight to settle things?

205
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:47,729
Damn, what are you trying to do?

206
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:50,481
Are you scared? Should we bet on it?

207
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:55,320
If I win, fried chicken for every
cell, and put me in House 8!

208
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:05,455
Hell, okay.

209
00:20:05,456 --> 00:20:08,957
If I win, transfer me and my
boys to another prison, okay?

210
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,460
Chief!

211
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:13,254
You heard them?

212
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:22,472
Go for it, bro!

213
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:30,730
Go!

214
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:42,075
Asshole...

215
00:20:42,076 --> 00:20:44,327
- Boss, you alright?
- Off!

216
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:11,729
My hand!

217
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,731
That's a foul, you asshole!

218
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:24,742
Get up, you motherfucker!

219
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:28,413
Stand up!

220
00:21:48,683 --> 00:21:50,351
Fuck!

221
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:13,666
Stop it! Stop!

222
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,752
Final blow, asshole!

223
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:20,173
You rocked it, man!

224
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,174
Boss! Boss!

225
00:22:21,175 --> 00:22:22,674
Quiet, you bastards!

226
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:28,013
Chicken! Chicken!

227
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:29,682
Fuck.

228
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,521
- You bastard.
- I want a leg!

229
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,023
Put them in my hands!

230
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:40,485
I want a wing! A wing!

231
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:46,782
Tastes delicious. Why don't you have some?

232
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:48,451
You don't mind missing dinner?

233
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:52,622
I only eat spicy chicken, asshole.

234
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:02,840
So all of you like spicy?

235
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:09,680
Farewell! I'm off.

236
00:23:23,778 --> 00:23:27,823
Hell, is this a prison or a dorm?

237
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:30,617
This is great.

238
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:32,786
This was arranged

239
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:36,958
in order to keep you quiet, so you behave.

240
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:43,423
I fought my ass to get in here.
I don't owe you any favors.

241
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:06,863
Hello.

242
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,782
Hi, Dr. Kim.

243
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:16,205
No, don't take that!

244
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:22,920
Is it?

245
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:26,715
All right, then.

246
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:29,552
Let's have a bowl of beef soup, then.

247
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:32,555
Okay.

248
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:53,284
The balance for the Woo-myung case.

249
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:57,038
Damn real-name account system
makes things so complicated.

250
00:24:57,622 --> 00:25:00,041
The first one's for you, so you take it.

251
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:01,918
The rest goes to the captain.

252
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:05,880
You've got stocks in Gold Wing?

253
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:09,091
- A bit.
- A bit, my ass.

254
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:11,051
Sell them.

255
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:12,762
They'll file bankruptcy in two days.

256
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:17,766
And what's this?

257
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:19,936
You don't know? It's all arranged.

258
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,104
So tell me what it is!

259
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:35,034
Your attitude gets on my nerves.

260
00:25:36,536 --> 00:25:38,538
You think I'm still a prisoner?

261
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:46,128
If you really want to
know, ask him yourself.

262
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:03,646
What are you in for?

263
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:08,025
Medical accident.

264
00:26:08,693 --> 00:26:09,860
Professional negligence.

265
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:11,362
Are you a doctor?

266
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:14,365
He's a real killer.
You'd better watch out.

267
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:19,203
The men here are not
just random prisoners.

268
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:22,622
Opener was an ex-researcher
at Se-sung Safe.

269
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:25,625
Mr. Yang was a chief operator
at army headquarters.

270
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:28,128
Butcher was a meatman.

271
00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:30,047
All of us are experts.

272
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:33,217
No place for the fuzz.

273
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:39,223
Watch your mouth.

274
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:42,143
I did well for myself, too.

275
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:45,646
Let me eat.

276
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:01,472
You should slow down.

277
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:08,061
Too many mouths to feed.
How can I slow down?

278
00:28:08,062 --> 00:28:10,222
Things are different under
the new Prison Service head.

279
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:15,069
If we worry over petty
details, we'll starve.

280
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,322
You don't know how things work here,

281
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:22,284
always being on the outside.

282
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:30,292
This latest matter is urgent.
Let's hurry, Mr. Warden.

283
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:41,053
Dr. Kim is great.

284
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:43,723
How does he get all this?

285
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:48,059
He took what was seized by
police, so no trouble for us.

286
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,978
So you figured it out?

287
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:51,814
We need to blast.

288
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:53,816
Blast?

289
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:57,153
There's a guy called Gi-tae.
He's in Jang-sung Prison.

290
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,487
He's the best in Korea at blasting.

291
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:03,324
Opener will do the safe,
Hak-kyu the transportation,

292
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:06,829
and Yong-cheol, back-up.
Four should be enough.

293
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,321
What the fuck?

294
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:36,418
I'm taking off.

295
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:18,502
You left me behind?

296
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:23,424
Haven't you heard about teamwork?

297
00:31:26,677 --> 00:31:28,178
Are we going or not?

298
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:38,105
- They seem to be done.
- Yes, sir.

299
00:32:06,342 --> 00:32:07,676
What are you doing?

300
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:36,622
We're fucked. What we do now?

301
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:43,087
Damn it!

302
00:33:03,691 --> 00:33:09,738
<i>KIM SANG-JO (AKA DR.KIM)
Nov 23, 1995</i>

303
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:12,533
Wait.

304
00:33:17,705 --> 00:33:18,706
Come on in.

305
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:22,750
- Warden.
- What is it?

306
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:24,086
Well...

307
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:27,547
Why are you telling me now?

308
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:30,217
What if the police
catch him for something?

309
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:35,723
Go get him! Do whatever it takes!

310
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:37,725
Yes, sir!

311
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:45,190
What is it?

312
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:48,027
What?

313
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:49,778
I see.

314
00:33:50,446 --> 00:33:53,532
The head of the Prison Service
is coming for an inspection.

315
00:33:54,116 --> 00:33:56,200
What the hell? Why so sudden?

316
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:57,786
You two change!

317
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,706
Kwon, stay up!

318
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:07,296
Let me open the door!

319
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:10,716
All clear at work, sir!

320
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,219
Why are you standing in the rain?

321
00:34:19,308 --> 00:34:20,628
What brings you here so suddenly?

322
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:22,311
Why?

323
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:25,314
- Should I notify you beforehand?
- No, sir.

324
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:27,524
Then why make a face?

325
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,859
- You got a problem with this?
- No, sir.

326
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,696
I'll see whether you have a problem.

327
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:36,658
You bastards need random checks.

328
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:39,161
Let's make our rounds.

329
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:42,206
All clear!

330
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:44,541
Reformation!

331
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,719
I told you to water the workroom floor!

332
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:58,304
It's bad for their bronchi.

333
00:34:58,305 --> 00:34:59,556
Yes, sir!

334
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:04,143
If you get caught taking
bribes from subcontractors,

335
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:05,687
you'll be in deep shit.

336
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:08,690
What is that?

337
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:12,861
You have a gardening class?

338
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:14,863
Yes, sir.

339
00:35:15,364 --> 00:35:17,157
What a sensitive prison you run.

340
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:28,377
Leftover ramen makes me crazy.

341
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:31,130
Just make what you can eat!

342
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:34,716
What?

343
00:35:37,136 --> 00:35:39,638
Damn pigs!

344
00:35:45,394 --> 00:35:46,394
Reformation!

345
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,900
Reformation!

346
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:54,903
Quite impressive.

347
00:35:55,404 --> 00:35:57,573
But the pruning is the key.

348
00:35:58,574 --> 00:36:00,242
You've got potted plants too?

349
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:03,786
- If so, I wanna take some.
- I see.

350
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:06,582
- Potted plants...
- Here they are!

351
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:14,798
You used to be in Gang-jin Prison,
didn't you?

352
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:19,595
Pardon?

353
00:36:20,262 --> 00:36:21,471
Fuck pardon.

354
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:23,724
You don't remember me?

355
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:27,227
#7126, Jung Ik-ho, right?

356
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:31,315
I even remember your prisoner number.

357
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:40,908
Now you're a model prisoner? Level A?

358
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,411
Are you sure about this?

359
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:46,455
That's...

360
00:36:47,456 --> 00:36:48,957
Look at these bastards.

361
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:51,960
Attention.

362
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:57,257
At ease.

363
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,387
I said 'at ease', asshole!

364
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,475
That's enough.

365
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,398
What did he just say?

366
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,600
You're a fucking big shot now!

367
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:21,490
Who's been spoiling this asshole?

368
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:32,584
Head on the ground.

369
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:41,051
You fucker.

370
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:49,893
This son of a bitch must've
forgotten about me.

371
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:52,061
Sir.

372
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:53,689
This is the last warning.

373
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,360
Head.

374
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:01,905
On the ground!

375
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,074
What's wrong with your eyes?

376
00:38:05,075 --> 00:38:07,494
Your head on the ground, you damn bastard!

377
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,748
You're resisting?

378
00:38:14,418 --> 00:38:16,669
- I told you...
- Damn it!

379
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,588
Why bother a man who didn't do anything?

380
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:22,008
Who do you think you are?

381
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:24,010
Don't prisoners have human rights?

382
00:38:24,011 --> 00:38:25,345
Why should he do that?

383
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:27,389
Shut your mouth!

384
00:38:27,556 --> 00:38:28,723
You damn son of a bitch.

385
00:38:28,724 --> 00:38:31,351
You put your damn head down!

386
00:38:31,727 --> 00:38:33,395
Shut your mouth, I said!

387
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:36,022
Why? What did I say wrong?

388
00:38:36,023 --> 00:38:41,320
This cheap bully has a nice henchman.

389
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,655
But you're still a scumbag.

390
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:45,406
What's wrong with you?

391
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:46,741
Where are you going? Motherfucker!

392
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:48,326
Shut him up!

393
00:38:48,327 --> 00:38:50,077
Come here, you son of a bitch!

394
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:51,078
Watch your mouth!

395
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:53,497
How dare you run away?

396
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,667
What are you doing! Beat him up.

397
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:02,841
You want to be a regular here?

398
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:04,593
Slow down, bastard.

399
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:09,181
You must love it in solitary.
Did you hide candy there?

400
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:19,024
Ouch, my back!

401
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,819
Close the door. It's chilly.

402
00:39:35,457 --> 00:39:37,125
Clean up this mess.

403
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:40,462
- I'll check back later.
- Yes, sir.

404
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:52,933
You!

405
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:22,838
<i>Never forget your original intention.</i>

406
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:47,279
I quit smoking.

407
00:40:48,697 --> 00:40:52,284
Damn bastards stepped on my back.
Hurts like hell.

408
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:55,704
What's your favorite?

409
00:40:57,873 --> 00:41:00,208
Anything you want to eat, name it.

410
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:04,588
Not much... I eat like a bird.

411
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:07,048
Then never mind.

412
00:41:07,549 --> 00:41:10,718
Hey, put this asshole back in the cell.

413
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:11,720
Yellow tail!

414
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:15,891
It's the season now.

415
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:18,059
You mean sashimi?

416
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,022
Why did you bother asking
if you can't make it happen?

417
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:36,203
What the heck?

418
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,288
This is a damned break out!

419
00:41:46,922 --> 00:41:48,548
Hey, quiet!

420
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:52,259
I'm escaping!

421
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,554
It's a real break out, bastards!

422
00:42:15,534 --> 00:42:19,954
I've been to so many prisons

423
00:42:19,955 --> 00:42:23,124
but never seen one like this.
My kind of place!

424
00:42:28,797 --> 00:42:30,381
That's damn good!

425
00:42:30,382 --> 00:42:32,884
It's worth being beaten.

426
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:51,361
Why did you do it?

427
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:56,992
Well, I don't know... I'm curious too.

428
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,035
To impress me?

429
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:01,371
There must be a benefit to impressing you?

430
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:04,623
Everyone in that prison
seems to crawl to you.

431
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:06,959
But what's the use?

432
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,297
No one stepped out for you
when you needed it.

433
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:16,720
Seeing that upset me,
so I decided to act, okay?

434
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:22,349
You crazy bastard.

435
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:25,186
You have to be crazy
to survive in fucking prison.

436
00:43:34,988 --> 00:43:37,657
- But what's your secret?
- Secret?

437
00:43:37,866 --> 00:43:40,035
Your secret to living well in prison.

438
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:42,203
I heard you can do anything.

439
00:43:42,871 --> 00:43:44,039
You envy me?

440
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:49,127
Then tell me so, you prick!

441
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:53,965
Of course, I fucking envy you.

442
00:43:56,301 --> 00:43:59,304
I heard your nickname was the Grim Reaper.

443
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:03,974
Let's not talk about the past. It hurts.

444
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:06,144
Can you go out and bring someone in?

445
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:11,983
$100K in cash just for finding him.

446
00:44:20,784 --> 00:44:23,243
I smell something dirty behind this.

447
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:26,080
Anyway, I'll catch him only.

448
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:27,957
Don't mix me up in other shit.

449
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:31,419
Don't you worry. Just do your job.

450
00:44:35,924 --> 00:44:38,301
<i>It's going to be cloudy
with a chance of rain...</i>

451
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:41,388
Let's have some quiet.

452
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:01,908
Lieutenant Song.

453
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:03,785
Brother.

454
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:06,412
I'm sure this is a hotbed of crime.
We need to expose it.

455
00:45:06,413 --> 00:45:09,958
That's ridiculous.
You think it's possible?

456
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:12,793
Even you think I am crazy?

457
00:45:12,794 --> 00:45:14,253
That's not it...

458
00:45:14,254 --> 00:45:16,296
You're a reporter. Not a policeman.

459
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:18,758
- That's why I came to you.
- Hey, Yu-gon.

460
00:45:21,386 --> 00:45:23,888
I need to get back. Sorry.

461
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:27,225
Hey, Yu-gon!

462
00:45:27,809 --> 00:45:30,979
Let's talk later. And call Mom!

463
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:53,834
<i>- Do you think we can trust him?
- Doesn't matter.</i>

464
00:45:53,835 --> 00:45:56,004
<i>He's disposable.</i>

465
00:45:58,423 --> 00:45:59,549
Hey!

466
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:05,012
<i>When you get out of prison, first
you visit guys who cheated you.</i>

467
00:46:05,013 --> 00:46:06,848
<i>To make them pay you back.</i>

468
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:10,185
<i>I still have a few sources
on the outside.</i>

469
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,896
<i>They say Hak-kyu was cheated by
Kangwei, his business partner.</i>

470
00:46:13,897 --> 00:46:15,064
Where are you?

471
00:46:15,565 --> 00:46:16,900
What the hell?

472
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:22,906
Got cigarettes?

473
00:46:23,323 --> 00:46:25,492
You go ahead and smoke.

474
00:46:29,078 --> 00:46:30,997
I told you, we're not here for you.

475
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:32,916
Where is Hak-kyu?

476
00:46:34,501 --> 00:46:38,004
You can't tell anyone I told you this!

477
00:46:39,172 --> 00:46:40,840
Fucking asshole!

478
00:46:41,174 --> 00:46:44,010
He went to Gun-san.
Asked me to find a ship to China.

479
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:56,063
Are you certain he's here?

480
00:46:56,064 --> 00:46:58,190
Of course not.

481
00:46:58,191 --> 00:47:00,151
Nothing in life is certain.

482
00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:11,578
But I heard he has a Chinese
mistress living here.

483
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:14,331
And this is an emerging
spot for smuggling.

484
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:16,417
If he ran away, this must be the place.

485
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:19,254
Let's wait and see.

486
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:29,347
Is he here?

487
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:35,270
Yes, he is.

488
00:47:46,114 --> 00:47:48,324
He looks outnumbered.

489
00:47:57,458 --> 00:48:01,254
Damn it, I hate getting soaked!

490
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:30,718
$100K!

491
00:49:43,523 --> 00:49:45,775
Fuck, I think I'm getting a cold.

492
00:49:47,193 --> 00:49:49,278
Did the warden ask him to do this, too?

493
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:53,198
I heard he's the troubleshooter here.

494
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:55,368
Anyway, catching a
jail breaker is incredible.

495
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:57,453
No, actually it's me who's incredible!

496
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:25,523
I'm sorry, sir.

497
00:50:30,028 --> 00:50:31,279
Why did you do it?

498
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,198
I just wanted to stop.

499
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:41,873
It won't happen again. Please forgive me.

500
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,155
Pardon?

501
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:49,292
From the outside, this might seem
like the lowest rung of life,

502
00:52:49,792 --> 00:52:51,252
but it is not.

503
00:52:53,462 --> 00:52:56,632
In here too, people live

504
00:52:56,966 --> 00:52:59,260
and time passes the same.

505
00:52:59,427 --> 00:53:01,803
Your life depends on

506
00:53:01,804 --> 00:53:04,974
how you make up your mind.

507
00:53:05,474 --> 00:53:11,314
You can't be a cop again anyway.
Take this as an opportunity.

508
00:53:44,305 --> 00:53:48,226
Can we have better pork next time?

509
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:51,562
Let's drink!

510
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:55,815
Eat slowly.

511
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:56,817
Let me pour for you.

512
00:54:02,657 --> 00:54:07,577
- Thank you, sir.
- For what?

513
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:08,995
I heard you sent my father

514
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:11,915
to Jeju Island last month
for his 70th birthday.

515
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:14,334
- I didn't know until now.
- Don't mention it, prick.

516
00:54:14,335 --> 00:54:16,003
It's nothing.

517
00:54:16,671 --> 00:54:20,507
Let's drink up, to us!

518
00:54:20,508 --> 00:54:23,010
- To us!
- To us!

519
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:33,688
- You two are the same age?
- Yes, sir.

520
00:54:33,896 --> 00:54:35,064
Good.

521
00:54:36,065 --> 00:54:38,818
You two can be of one mind.

522
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:40,986
When I was a cop,

523
00:54:40,987 --> 00:54:43,656
I was about to screw your Far East Gang.

524
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:47,325
If I hadn't been dragged to headquarters,

525
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:49,327
we would've met long ago.

526
00:54:49,328 --> 00:54:50,746
What are you trying to say, fucker?

527
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:57,086
You wanna face off now?

528
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:19,524
I'm sorry, sir.

529
00:55:41,005 --> 00:55:43,674
Eat quick and clean up.

530
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:50,931
And you watch your damned mouth.

531
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:59,439
Hey, you guarantee me
all-night fun with a girl?

532
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,816
Whatever you want!

533
00:56:04,153 --> 00:56:06,447
Here he comes! Just five minutes!

534
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:13,454
Mr. Ma, come on in.

535
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:15,831
What the fuck is going on?

536
00:56:20,461 --> 00:56:23,505
Being alone with you reminds
me of the good old days.

537
00:56:23,506 --> 00:56:26,424
What the fuck happened to us?

538
00:56:26,425 --> 00:56:27,593
Huh?

539
00:56:27,927 --> 00:56:29,167
What happened to your forehead?

540
00:56:31,931 --> 00:56:34,016
Are you going to stay here forever?

541
00:56:35,184 --> 00:56:36,685
You're out next year.

542
00:56:39,772 --> 00:56:41,148
What you gonna do?

543
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:42,982
The word is out already.

544
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:45,653
You kissing the ass of a jerk
who don't belong to any gang.

545
00:56:46,445 --> 00:56:48,781
Who says that shit?

546
00:56:49,949 --> 00:56:51,492
To be honest, it's not 100% wrong.

547
00:56:53,494 --> 00:56:55,161
I'm so scared.

548
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:58,165
Don't get upset. I'm telling
this for your sake.

549
00:56:58,624 --> 00:57:02,085
I think that crazy bastard
Song might push you out.

550
00:57:02,086 --> 00:57:04,504
You'll lose everything
standing around gawking.

551
00:57:04,505 --> 00:57:05,840
Then you get out of prison,

552
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:08,509
and you're nothing but a loser.

553
00:57:11,512 --> 00:57:12,763
I've heard enough.

554
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:15,599
Mr. Ma.

555
00:57:16,517 --> 00:57:17,767
I didn't ask you to do anything.

556
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:21,856
Just step back and close your eyes.
I'll take care of the rest.

557
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:28,195
For old times' sake
I didn't hear anything.

558
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:31,699
But pull this shit again,
and you're dead meat.

559
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:37,955
Gosh, what a royal servant you are!

<i>SONG YU-CHEOL
DONG-GOOK DAILY</i>

561
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:33,511
<i>Captain told me to look into him.</i>

562
00:58:33,552 --> 00:58:35,592
His name's Song Yu-cheol,
a real journalist.

563
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:37,932
Specializing in investigative reporting,

564
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:39,808
<i>they call him Pit Bull Terrier.</i>

565
00:58:39,934 --> 00:58:41,936
<i>He never let go once he finds something.</i>

566
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:44,687
<i>He's onto us now.</i>

567
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:48,942
<i>I think he'll publish a scoop
soon, so go tell captain</i>

568
00:58:48,943 --> 00:58:50,694
<i>to get rid of him quickly.</i>

569
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:55,533
<i>This is a hotbed of crime.
We need to expose it.</i>

570
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,536
Even you think I am crazy?

571
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:04,375
I must be out of my mind.

572
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:13,884
- Who the hell are you?
- Pardon?

573
00:59:14,134 --> 00:59:18,639
- What are you doing here?
- I'm cleaning.

574
00:59:20,349 --> 00:59:21,350
What?

575
00:59:29,984 --> 00:59:31,819
What's taking so long?

576
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:35,155
Sir, I didn't know you're still here.

577
00:59:35,864 --> 00:59:37,366
Why is he here?

578
00:59:37,992 --> 00:59:40,201
I told him to clean up.

579
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:41,703
Ministry of Justice people are coming.

580
00:59:41,704 --> 00:59:42,871
Who asked you to do that?

581
00:59:43,622 --> 00:59:44,942
I'm sorry, sir. Get the fuck out!

582
00:59:56,051 --> 00:59:59,304
It's not your first time, is it?
I've been watching you.

583
00:59:59,305 --> 01:00:02,850
You go to that room
whenever you have a chance.

584
01:00:03,642 --> 01:00:04,685
Why'd you do that?

585
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:07,812
Well... I have some light fingers.

586
01:00:07,813 --> 01:00:10,357
I see.

587
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:14,361
So what did you get? Show me.

588
01:00:16,155 --> 01:00:17,364
Don't move!

589
01:00:17,865 --> 01:00:19,867
If you touch an officer,
you're on jankers.

590
01:00:30,044 --> 01:00:31,879
I knew it.

591
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:37,133
You can smell money, I guess.
Must be a lot of it, right?

592
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:39,470
I'll confiscate this.
I'm sure you get my meaning.

593
01:00:39,637 --> 01:00:40,804
No, sir.

594
01:00:41,889 --> 01:00:46,059
Asshole, I want some crumbs
off Ik-ho's table, too!

595
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:48,811
Everyone, from the warden to the chief,

596
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:51,314
enjoys luxuries sponging off of Ik-ho.

597
01:00:51,315 --> 01:00:54,902
Why can't I get any benefit?

598
01:00:57,821 --> 01:01:00,782
What are you doing here? We need to hurry.

599
01:01:00,783 --> 01:01:02,951
I'm giving guidance...

600
01:01:03,911 --> 01:01:05,912
Can I go now?

601
01:01:05,913 --> 01:01:07,456
I'll see you soon.

602
01:01:14,296 --> 01:01:16,465
Isn't it cool?

603
01:01:16,924 --> 01:01:20,386
I'll have it ready in front of
this prison when I get out.

604
01:01:21,387 --> 01:01:24,222
Anyway, we're all blessed

605
01:01:24,223 --> 01:01:29,811
to meet our generous captain here.

606
01:01:29,812 --> 01:01:31,980
Fucking blessed!

607
01:01:33,315 --> 01:01:36,318
Thanks to him, we could die at any time.

608
01:01:37,736 --> 01:01:40,279
What's wrong with you?

609
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:41,906
Did I say anything wrong?

610
01:01:41,907 --> 01:01:44,742
Are you on dope, junkie?

611
01:01:44,743 --> 01:01:45,953
Fuck!

612
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:49,456
I need some sleep!

613
01:02:00,259 --> 01:02:01,468
Okay.

614
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:03,470
They're sober as a judge...

615
01:02:05,472 --> 01:02:09,308
You did a great job this time.

616
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:12,813
No one cares about a bankrupt
subcontractor to a prison.

617
01:02:13,313 --> 01:02:14,480
I really appreciate it.

618
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:16,065
But now as chairman of

619
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:19,486
the reformation conference,
this is the least you can do!

620
01:02:20,487 --> 01:02:23,323
- Let's have some tea.
- Sounds great.

621
01:02:25,576 --> 01:02:27,076
Today is a special off day.

622
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:29,829
Let everyone stop working
and rest for a day.

623
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:30,998
Yes, sir.

624
01:02:35,252 --> 01:02:36,253
Hey!

625
01:02:37,171 --> 01:02:38,504
Clean these up

626
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:42,384
and deliver them to
each house quickly.

627
01:02:42,843 --> 01:02:44,011
Yes, sir.

628
01:02:48,891 --> 01:02:51,018
Everyone out!

629
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:55,022
I said, out!

630
01:02:58,358 --> 01:03:00,819
You too get out!

631
01:03:01,236 --> 01:03:03,405
Why? I'm fucking busy.

632
01:03:05,324 --> 01:03:07,492
I said 'out'. You motherfucker!

633
01:03:07,493 --> 01:03:08,577
Motherfucker?

634
01:03:09,495 --> 01:03:11,079
Who gets the blame if dinner is burned?

635
01:03:11,914 --> 01:03:13,081
Damn bastard.

636
01:03:13,916 --> 01:03:16,585
This hasn't changed a bit.

637
01:03:22,508 --> 01:03:24,009
Come here and meet.

638
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:27,845
- Dr. Kim.
- Not a real doctor.

639
01:03:27,846 --> 01:03:31,391
I got that nickname here
as I was a walking dictionary.

640
01:03:31,892 --> 01:03:34,019
Nice to meet you. Kim Sang-jo.

641
01:03:38,398 --> 01:03:41,567
I wanted to meet, since our
captain adores you so much...

642
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:45,072
But don't we need a background check?

643
01:03:49,493 --> 01:03:52,162
Just kidding.

644
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:56,833
I've told him often we need
someone from the police.

645
01:03:56,834 --> 01:03:59,002
Now we've got you, my job
will be much easier.

646
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:00,503
Let's work well together.

647
01:04:00,504 --> 01:04:04,174
- Hey, you take a rest.
- Yes, sir.

648
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:09,428
President Lee. You made the right choice.

649
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:11,265
The products here are great.

650
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,447
Be quiet!

651
01:04:34,329 --> 01:04:35,622
Check it yourself.

652
01:04:36,123 --> 01:04:38,000
Take your time.

653
01:04:50,512 --> 01:04:51,680
What the hell?

654
01:05:04,943 --> 01:05:06,111
Go in.

655
01:05:15,495 --> 01:05:17,998
You can wire the money here...

656
01:05:18,332 --> 01:05:19,499
What are you doing?

657
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:22,336
You take all the cream?

658
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:24,670
To eat fruit you must climb a tree.

659
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:27,007
I can't stay in the same
prison as you any longer.

660
01:05:27,507 --> 01:05:30,427
I'll push you out today. You motherfucker!

661
01:05:34,932 --> 01:05:35,933
Why are you rushing out?

662
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:40,520
What the fuck is it?

663
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:47,526
You operate on such a huge scale!

664
01:05:47,527 --> 01:05:49,111
You're fucked now.

665
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:50,613
I'll tell everyone on
the outside about this.

666
01:05:50,614 --> 01:05:51,782
Boys!

667
01:05:57,537 --> 01:06:01,583
Your luck depends on who your boss is.

668
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:05,544
Today one of you will

669
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:08,215
lose a fucking eyeball because of him!

670
01:06:10,217 --> 01:06:12,093
Don't stand there, assholes!

671
01:06:12,094 --> 01:06:14,388
He's bluffing! Get him!

672
01:06:24,189 --> 01:06:26,108
Since I came into prison,

673
01:06:26,441 --> 01:06:29,194
I've dug out nine eyeballs
and eaten them all.

674
01:06:30,362 --> 01:06:32,363
The fucking judge warned me

675
01:06:32,364 --> 01:06:35,033
I'd be hanged if I did it one more time.

676
01:06:36,702 --> 01:06:38,703
Stay still, motherfucker.

677
01:06:38,704 --> 01:06:39,704
You won't die.

678
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,042
After eating your eyeball,

679
01:06:45,043 --> 01:06:48,547
I'll die for you. Fair enough?

680
01:06:53,093 --> 01:06:55,554
I apologize, sir.

681
01:06:59,057 --> 01:07:01,268
You know a gang is all about saving face.

682
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:06,188
I have my men and territory.

683
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:09,776
If this rumor gets out, I lose everything.

684
01:07:14,281 --> 01:07:16,199
You stupid moron.

685
01:07:16,616 --> 01:07:17,784
Sir!

686
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:20,787
I'll die for you!

687
01:07:21,204 --> 01:07:22,539
Fuck you.

688
01:07:27,127 --> 01:07:30,797
Please let me serve you.

689
01:07:34,134 --> 01:07:35,135
You fucking bastard.

690
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:41,183
You son of a bitch.

691
01:07:41,516 --> 01:07:42,684
Did my begging flatter you?

692
01:07:43,143 --> 01:07:46,688
Stupid asshole without any backing
tries to control this place?

693
01:07:49,858 --> 01:07:51,193
Boss!

694
01:07:54,654 --> 01:07:55,864
Damn son of a bitch!

695
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:06,309
You crazy son of a bitch!

696
01:09:25,579 --> 01:09:27,414
Attention! Stop it!

697
01:09:28,415 --> 01:09:30,624
I told you to stop!

698
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:31,751
Stop, you asshole!

699
01:09:56,902 --> 01:09:58,320
Damn...

700
01:09:59,571 --> 01:10:01,572
Give these morons a little freedom,

701
01:10:01,573 --> 01:10:03,950
and they show their true colors.

702
01:10:10,624 --> 01:10:13,292
Send the injured to the dispensary.

703
01:10:13,293 --> 01:10:15,295
And the rest to the investigation room!

704
01:10:20,467 --> 01:10:23,803
Fucking moron.

705
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,660
I need to check.

706
01:10:59,172 --> 01:11:03,301
<i>SONG YU-CHEOL</i>

707
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:12,352
Listen,

708
01:11:13,061 --> 01:11:15,689
this doesn't look like an accident.

709
01:11:25,991 --> 01:11:29,995
There's no witness, no evidence.

710
01:11:30,912 --> 01:11:33,415
It must be premeditated murder.

711
01:11:35,583 --> 01:11:37,585
Any idea who did it?

712
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:01,985
That fucking bully.

713
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:05,905
Did he stab you deeply?

714
01:12:11,661 --> 01:12:14,414
I owe you too much too often, I guess?

715
01:12:41,107 --> 01:12:44,152
If the prime suspect in a
case is already in prison,

716
01:12:44,444 --> 01:12:47,447
he has the perfect alibi.

717
01:12:47,572 --> 01:12:50,909
After investigating, I
found out these cold cases

718
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:56,122
are all related to this prison,
regardless of the type of crime.

719
01:12:56,831 --> 01:13:00,126
Chief, we need to solve this mystery.

720
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:03,755
But it's an assumption without
any conclusive evidence.

721
01:13:04,089 --> 01:13:07,092
- I agree, but...
- Listen, Jeong.

722
01:13:07,425 --> 01:13:09,928
- Yes, sir.
- Are you sure about this?

723
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:15,766
Circumstantial evidence shows
what he says is highly possible.

724
01:13:15,767 --> 01:13:18,435
How will you prove it all? Tell me.

725
01:13:18,436 --> 01:13:21,939
- Let's form a special task force...
- Then we'd need to re-open

726
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:23,941
all the cases he mentioned.

727
01:13:23,942 --> 01:13:28,988
We'd need to summon the prosecution,
police, court and Prison Service.

728
01:13:29,447 --> 01:13:32,826
You think we can do that?
At a time like this?

729
01:13:34,119 --> 01:13:35,495
Chief!

730
01:13:40,417 --> 01:13:42,001
I understand how you feel.

731
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:45,588
But this is too big.

732
01:13:47,006 --> 01:13:48,925
Honestly, I'm not sure about this.

733
01:13:52,846 --> 01:13:54,013
Let's call it off.

734
01:14:02,605 --> 01:14:03,773
Sir.

735
01:14:06,276 --> 01:14:07,777
Let me go in there.

736
01:14:10,196 --> 01:14:11,531
What?

737
01:14:14,701 --> 01:14:16,703
I need to go in myself.

738
01:14:19,789 --> 01:14:20,915
From in there,

739
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:23,710
I'll find out

740
01:14:24,043 --> 01:14:27,714
who's planning what, and how they do it.

741
01:14:41,269 --> 01:14:43,521
You fucking assholes!

742
01:14:44,272 --> 01:14:45,773
I'm leaving!

743
01:14:46,774 --> 01:14:50,278
Enjoy yourselves, and go to hell!

744
01:14:50,945 --> 01:14:52,197
You fucking bastards!

745
01:15:16,888 --> 01:15:18,264
Let me have one.

746
01:15:20,934 --> 01:15:22,185
Fuck you.

747
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:35,949
What the hell? Hey!

748
01:15:57,971 --> 01:15:59,138
What is it?

749
01:15:59,806 --> 01:16:03,309
Why this sudden call?

750
01:16:04,143 --> 01:16:05,311
Quiet!

751
01:16:23,121 --> 01:16:27,625
Someone here backstabbed me.

752
01:16:31,713 --> 01:16:33,631
Come out now,

753
01:16:34,799 --> 01:16:36,384
or I'll kill you.

754
01:17:04,037 --> 01:17:07,957
Please forgive me. I will never...

755
01:17:12,045 --> 01:17:13,129
Hey, Mr. Ma.

756
01:17:14,797 --> 01:17:17,717
If you had gotten rid of me,

757
01:17:18,801 --> 01:17:21,387
after conspiring with Chang-gil,

758
01:17:22,305 --> 01:17:25,725
who'd have been the boss?
You or that bastard?

759
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:28,811
Hey!

760
01:17:30,063 --> 01:17:32,148
Anyone to take care of this rat?

761
01:17:34,734 --> 01:17:35,818
No one?

762
01:17:36,819 --> 01:17:39,072
You chickens.

763
01:17:40,907 --> 01:17:42,283
Hey, Song Yu-gon.

764
01:17:43,951 --> 01:17:45,286
You do it.

765
01:17:59,133 --> 01:18:00,301
You know...

766
01:18:00,968 --> 01:18:03,388
You lost your hand
working on this machine.

767
01:19:24,051 --> 01:19:25,845
Great view, isn't it?

768
01:19:31,392 --> 01:19:32,560
You feel shitty?

769
01:19:37,398 --> 01:19:39,984
In here's no different from the outside.

770
01:19:41,402 --> 01:19:45,239
The more desperate you are to survive

771
01:19:46,157 --> 01:19:47,492
the more sins you commit.

772
01:19:48,409 --> 01:19:51,412
That's how life is.

773
01:19:57,418 --> 01:20:00,004
You asked me my secret.

774
01:20:01,047 --> 01:20:03,174
How I live well in here.

775
01:20:05,843 --> 01:20:09,387
Whoever you fight against,
hit the leader first.

776
01:20:09,388 --> 01:20:11,057
That's the fastest way.

777
01:20:11,891 --> 01:20:15,853
When the minions see
their boss as nothing,

778
01:20:16,395 --> 01:20:18,189
it's game over.

779
01:20:22,401 --> 01:20:27,572
You might think the world goes
around by itself, but it doesn't.

780
01:20:27,573 --> 01:20:33,578
There's people running it as they like.

781
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:34,580
This way and that way...

782
01:20:37,917 --> 01:20:39,168
You know...

783
01:20:40,419 --> 01:20:44,674
from in here I'll have
those bastards in my pocket.

784
01:20:48,594 --> 01:20:51,347
Just trust me and follow.

785
01:20:52,265 --> 01:20:53,266
Then you'll be fine.

786
01:21:23,004 --> 01:21:25,172
Fuck, today's not my day.

787
01:21:28,342 --> 01:21:31,929
- You cleaned everything up?
- Pardon?

788
01:21:32,179 --> 01:21:33,430
In recent years...

789
01:21:33,431 --> 01:21:37,518
you moved to a bigger house
and bought some land.

790
01:21:38,019 --> 01:21:39,186
Also I heard...

791
01:21:41,314 --> 01:21:43,315
you're buying a villa in Geo-je Island.

792
01:21:43,316 --> 01:21:46,485
All under your wife's name.

793
01:21:46,944 --> 01:21:50,113
A warden can't afford all those.

794
01:21:50,114 --> 01:21:51,282
Can he?

795
01:21:53,284 --> 01:21:55,119
You're right.

796
01:21:55,328 --> 01:21:56,996
But you don't have to worry...

797
01:21:58,289 --> 01:22:01,083
There's something between
you and that Ik-ho bastard.

798
01:22:03,336 --> 01:22:05,004
You won't tell me?

799
01:22:05,504 --> 01:22:07,924
You want a special audit?

800
01:22:11,177 --> 01:22:12,178
Ready!

801
01:22:14,013 --> 01:22:15,013
Gotcha!

802
01:22:16,015 --> 01:22:19,685
Pass me the onions!

803
01:22:25,775 --> 01:22:27,192
What the heck?

804
01:22:27,193 --> 01:22:28,777
You only peeled this much?

805
01:22:28,778 --> 01:22:31,030
Has anyone seen Yu-gon?

806
01:22:35,117 --> 01:22:37,703
- Where is he?
- Yes?

807
01:22:39,038 --> 01:22:41,415
He's been out.

808
01:22:41,749 --> 01:22:43,751
Out? To where?

809
01:22:45,211 --> 01:22:48,714
Assigned to assist civil authorities.

810
01:22:50,424 --> 01:22:52,051
Look at this mess...

811
01:22:55,429 --> 01:22:57,264
- Let's wrap up!
- Yes.

812
01:22:58,265 --> 01:23:01,518
There are goods sent from the
women's society in storage.

813
01:23:01,519 --> 01:23:03,688
- Put them in the bus!
- Yes, sir.

814
01:23:05,690 --> 01:23:07,274
Give me the balance!

815
01:23:11,362 --> 01:23:13,531
What is it?

816
01:23:14,615 --> 01:23:16,449
What do you care?

817
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:20,203
Don't get me into trouble later.

818
01:23:20,204 --> 01:23:22,081
You keep your mouth zipped, too.

819
01:23:36,595 --> 01:23:40,433
This isn't a prison, it's a huge
crime assembly line by Jung Ik-ho.

820
01:23:40,683 --> 01:23:43,768
He sends out prisoners to
commit crimes for money,

821
01:23:43,769 --> 01:23:47,273
like a coach picking players for a game.

822
01:23:47,690 --> 01:23:50,525
He has men for planning,
and for actions outside.

823
01:23:50,526 --> 01:23:53,362
The warden is the messenger
between them and Ik-ho.

824
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:56,532
You'll be in deep trouble
if you stay there longer.

825
01:23:56,782 --> 01:24:00,118
Don't try anything risky.
Just hang on for a few days.

826
01:24:00,119 --> 01:24:03,122
I'll start by getting a stay of execution.

827
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:07,293
This will be our only chance to catch him.

828
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:09,795
I can't leave now.

829
01:24:12,465 --> 01:24:15,468
I need to twist his neck with one move.

830
01:24:17,136 --> 01:24:18,304
Come in.

831
01:24:22,349 --> 01:24:23,517
Come and sit.

832
01:24:28,355 --> 01:24:29,523
Leave it.

833
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:34,320
You come and sit too.

834
01:24:51,378 --> 01:24:52,797
Shall I smoke one, for once?

835
01:25:11,190 --> 01:25:13,526
An exemplary prisoner for 5 years.

836
01:25:13,859 --> 01:25:16,861
18 years in total with
an impressive record.

837
01:25:16,862 --> 01:25:19,365
You've been reformed enough, I believe.

838
01:25:25,871 --> 01:25:27,456
<i>REQUEST FOR APPROVAL OF PAROLE</i>

839
01:25:30,793 --> 01:25:32,294
What are you trying to do?

840
01:25:33,629 --> 01:25:34,880
Leave now.

841
01:25:39,385 --> 01:25:41,220
Bae, that bastard,

842
01:25:41,637 --> 01:25:43,222
knows what you've been doing.

843
01:25:45,391 --> 01:25:47,642
I think I can cover up
what we did until now.

844
01:25:47,643 --> 01:25:49,728
But not anymore.

845
01:25:49,979 --> 01:25:53,649
This is the only solution
I can think of now.

846
01:25:59,321 --> 01:26:00,406
What is it?

847
01:26:02,241 --> 01:26:03,409
You don't want to leave?

848
01:26:03,951 --> 01:26:05,744
You need a fresh start, don't you?

849
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:09,455
With my signature, you'll be free.

850
01:26:09,456 --> 01:26:11,292
Better be grateful.

851
01:26:11,959 --> 01:26:13,460
Go out and live a good life.

852
01:26:20,301 --> 01:26:23,887
I didn't know there was this side to you.

853
01:26:23,888 --> 01:26:26,557
You should've listened when
I told you to slow down!

854
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:38,652
Who should've listened to whom?

855
01:26:46,285 --> 01:26:48,453
You forgot who made

856
01:26:48,454 --> 01:26:51,457
a petty guard a warden?

857
01:26:53,751 --> 01:26:56,462
Now you've earned your crust,

858
01:26:57,296 --> 01:26:59,256
you want a way out?

859
01:27:01,967 --> 01:27:04,720
If you ever try pulling a
filthy stunt like this again,

860
01:27:05,888 --> 01:27:08,723
I'll make your wife

861
01:27:08,724 --> 01:27:12,728
spend the rest of her
life in prison, Warden!

862
01:28:23,507 --> 01:28:27,886
Hey, I heard you went out
to support civil work?

863
01:28:28,887 --> 01:28:32,558
I was bored and wanted some fresh air.

864
01:28:40,649 --> 01:28:41,734
What are you waiting for?

865
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:45,738
The light's green.

866
01:28:48,824 --> 01:28:52,744
<i>Dr. Kim in charge of planning,
and Hwang of operations.</i>

867
01:28:52,745 --> 01:28:54,496
<i>Watch them closely.</i>

868
01:28:59,418 --> 01:29:02,838
If they move together, that's
a sign something is imminent.

869
01:29:05,674 --> 01:29:09,178
<i>When the message comes in,
the inside starts to get prepared.</i>

870
01:29:20,981 --> 01:29:22,816
- Hello?
- <i>It's me.</i>

871
01:29:23,942 --> 01:29:25,110
Where are you?

872
01:30:07,111 --> 01:30:10,614
<i>Don't worry about me.
Take care of yourself.</i>

873
01:30:12,825 --> 01:30:16,161
<i>Can you hear me, son?</i>

874
01:30:16,954 --> 01:30:19,832
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

875
01:30:39,601 --> 01:30:40,936
I can't leave now.

876
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:44,690
I need to twist his neck with one move.

877
01:30:45,774 --> 01:30:49,611
When they come out, we'll bust them all.

878
01:30:52,781 --> 01:30:54,950
<i>- Where are you now?
- No time to talk.</i>

879
01:30:55,701 --> 01:30:57,034
A foundry outside An-san.

880
01:30:57,035 --> 01:30:58,537
Get here fast!

881
01:31:03,876 --> 01:31:05,210
<i>A, secure the position.</i>

882
01:31:08,255 --> 01:31:10,090
<i>B is standing by.</i>

883
01:31:11,049 --> 01:31:12,217
<i>Send them in.</i>

884
01:31:29,109 --> 01:31:30,611
<i>Update me on the situation.</i>

885
01:31:30,777 --> 01:31:32,196
<i>We're subduing them now.</i>

886
01:31:32,613 --> 01:31:35,114
<i>Get the suspect first.
Obtain ID from all the workers.</i>

887
01:31:35,115 --> 01:31:41,038
<i>A, investigation complete,
no suspect identified.</i>

888
01:31:46,543 --> 01:31:48,587
What? There's nothing here.

889
01:31:58,055 --> 01:32:00,599
By the way, why'd we
change the destination?

890
01:32:02,518 --> 01:32:04,686
You don't have to know.

891
01:32:11,026 --> 01:32:13,111
Sit back and enjoy the show.

892
01:32:50,691 --> 01:32:52,985
What... the hell are you doing?

893
01:32:53,151 --> 01:32:54,652
How have you been?

894
01:32:54,653 --> 01:32:56,028
You've gone too far, you son of a bitch!

895
01:32:56,029 --> 01:32:58,656
I don't have time to go too far.

896
01:32:58,657 --> 01:33:00,032
I'm here to work.

897
01:33:00,033 --> 01:33:01,201
You motherfucker!

898
01:33:01,702 --> 01:33:07,207
I'm promoting our warden
to head of Prison Service!

899
01:33:07,624 --> 01:33:09,959
So that I can control

900
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:13,046
all the prisons in this country.
What do you think?

901
01:33:13,630 --> 01:33:14,715
Isn't it great?

902
01:33:21,305 --> 01:33:22,639
What the hell?

903
01:33:23,682 --> 01:33:25,309
Wait!

904
01:33:25,809 --> 01:33:27,185
I get what you mean.

905
01:33:28,312 --> 01:33:31,022
I'll resign quietly.

906
01:33:31,023 --> 01:33:32,190
Okay?

907
01:33:34,318 --> 01:33:35,360
You will?

908
01:33:36,153 --> 01:33:39,323
Then you don't mind going
to hell right now, do you?

909
01:33:39,615 --> 01:33:41,616
Ik-ho, wait!

910
01:33:41,617 --> 01:33:44,620
You brought all this on yourself.

911
01:33:45,787 --> 01:33:47,289
Stop it, Ik-ho!

912
01:33:47,789 --> 01:33:49,041
I'm sorry!

913
01:33:51,209 --> 01:33:52,711
You bastards!

914
01:34:38,965 --> 01:34:41,133
<i>There's nothing we can do
if the operation fails.</i>

915
01:34:41,134 --> 01:34:42,468
<i>Withdraw.</i>

916
01:34:42,469 --> 01:34:44,804
They're outside of the prison now.

917
01:34:44,805 --> 01:34:46,972
I also confirmed the head of
Prison Service is missing.

918
01:34:46,973 --> 01:34:50,059
If we block them from returning
to the prison, we have a chance.

919
01:34:50,060 --> 01:34:51,060
<i>Listen.</i>

920
01:34:51,061 --> 01:34:53,146
I'll find another way.
So just withdraw now.

921
01:34:53,814 --> 01:34:57,233
If you add fuel to the fire,
it will rage out of control!

922
01:34:57,234 --> 01:34:59,151
But Yu-gon will be in danger.

923
01:34:59,152 --> 01:35:00,945
What if something happens to him?

924
01:35:00,946 --> 01:35:03,114
<i>Listen to me. Retreat now!</i>

925
01:35:03,115 --> 01:35:04,281
- <i>That's an order!</i>
- But, please...

926
01:35:04,282 --> 01:35:05,409
Chief!

927
01:35:09,788 --> 01:35:10,956
Yeah?

928
01:35:13,291 --> 01:35:14,793
All right.

929
01:35:22,008 --> 01:35:24,094
<i>SUNG-AN PRISON 23 Km</i>

930
01:35:45,323 --> 01:35:48,493
It's not always easy to travel one's path.

931
01:35:50,328 --> 01:35:52,414
Can you just kill people at will?

932
01:35:52,831 --> 01:35:57,002
What else can I do?
They all stand in my way.

933
01:36:03,508 --> 01:36:05,510
You know this guy?

934
01:36:14,352 --> 01:36:15,520
Who is he?

935
01:36:16,563 --> 01:36:19,900
Dr. Kim's tail.

936
01:36:21,401 --> 01:36:25,238
The fuzz ambushed the factory
like packs of wild dogs.

937
01:36:26,490 --> 01:36:29,242
It's obvious there's a rat among us.

938
01:36:30,494 --> 01:36:36,249
Is it the warden, Byung-soo or Dr.
Kim? I can't trust anyone.

939
01:36:49,387 --> 01:36:51,556
- Bum-mo.
- Yes.

940
01:36:52,015 --> 01:36:53,225
You all set?

941
01:36:59,022 --> 01:37:05,070
So Mr. Jeong doesn't know Yu-gon?
Yu-gon said likewise.

942
01:37:06,238 --> 01:37:08,073
Then that's that.

943
01:37:08,490 --> 01:37:09,825
Finish him off now.

944
01:37:26,258 --> 01:37:28,426
I had a similar case once.

945
01:37:29,594 --> 01:37:34,099
A fucking reporter was bugging me so much.

946
01:37:40,272 --> 01:37:43,483
I thought I cleared it up then

947
01:37:43,650 --> 01:37:46,653
but now this again.
Why do you think that is?

948
01:37:58,164 --> 01:37:59,416
Stop it.

949
01:38:09,593 --> 01:38:11,928
He's got nothing to do with you.

950
01:38:12,345 --> 01:38:13,179
Stop right there.

951
01:38:13,180 --> 01:38:16,015
Then why did you drag him into this?

952
01:38:16,016 --> 01:38:19,269
He's dying because of you.

953
01:38:24,941 --> 01:38:26,109
Stop it now.

954
01:38:27,611 --> 01:38:29,320
<i>No... No...</i>

955
01:38:29,321 --> 01:38:31,448
I said stop, son of a bitch!

956
01:39:03,188 --> 01:39:04,689
Damn it.

957
01:39:07,359 --> 01:39:08,526
So?

958
01:39:09,611 --> 01:39:11,363
What happened to Bae?

959
01:39:12,447 --> 01:39:14,699
- I suppose...
- Bastards!

960
01:39:17,535 --> 01:39:19,287
Who the fuck are you?

961
01:39:19,621 --> 01:39:21,581
Are you an officer, or
a prisoner's henchman?

962
01:39:23,708 --> 01:39:25,377
Then what about you?

963
01:39:42,185 --> 01:39:43,353
Where are those fuckers?

964
01:39:48,525 --> 01:39:50,110
How many people know about this?

965
01:39:52,278 --> 01:39:58,201
How many more should I send to hell?

966
01:40:00,745 --> 01:40:02,080
Tell me.

967
01:40:12,257 --> 01:40:14,551
What do you want me to do with you?

968
01:40:14,759 --> 01:40:17,594
You crazy bastard! Do whatever you want!

969
01:40:17,595 --> 01:40:19,431
I figured myself dead when I came in here.

970
01:40:19,681 --> 01:40:22,767
After all you did to get this far.
You okay with that?

971
01:40:23,184 --> 01:40:26,187
Doesn't matter. It ain't over yet.

972
01:40:26,521 --> 01:40:28,188
Now I remember.

973
01:40:28,189 --> 01:40:30,025
It was me who killed your brother.

974
01:40:31,693 --> 01:40:34,195
Did you know that?

975
01:40:36,448 --> 01:40:39,117
If I knew, I'd have killed you already.

976
01:40:40,618 --> 01:40:43,872
But that's not all you did.

977
01:40:45,206 --> 01:40:46,458
Just wait.

978
01:40:46,708 --> 01:40:48,209
I'll make you

979
01:40:48,626 --> 01:40:50,545
pay for everything you did...

980
01:40:58,386 --> 01:41:01,639
I knew that you were
the real deal.

981
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:04,851
Whatever I decide about you...

982
01:41:05,477 --> 01:41:07,645
remember it's nothing personal.

983
01:41:08,688 --> 01:41:12,649
And I don't regret
having trusted you.

984
01:41:12,650 --> 01:41:14,152
But still...

985
01:41:17,322 --> 01:41:19,324
I guess this is the end.

986
01:41:19,616 --> 01:41:22,118
I can't take it any longer.

987
01:41:23,870 --> 01:41:25,538
I think you understand too.

988
01:41:40,345 --> 01:41:41,678
Are you out of your mind?

989
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:45,641
You collected those shitty
tapes like a scared rat.

990
01:41:45,642 --> 01:41:46,851
You caused this shit.

991
01:41:49,521 --> 01:41:51,188
There's no time. Finish him off now!

992
01:41:51,189 --> 01:41:53,483
You shut your mouth and get lost.

993
01:41:56,194 --> 01:41:57,862
What did you say to me?

994
01:42:02,867 --> 01:42:06,621
I treat a scumbag convict well,

995
01:42:08,540 --> 01:42:10,792
and now you think you're something?

996
01:42:22,554 --> 01:42:23,972
Let's call it off.

997
01:42:32,313 --> 01:42:34,232
Why do you keep wanting to call it off?

998
01:42:34,816 --> 01:42:36,401
It's only the beginning for me.

999
01:42:36,901 --> 01:42:39,404
Byung-soo, from today you're the warden.

1000
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:04,304
How about this?

1001
01:43:05,555 --> 01:43:09,475
You killed yourself
after shooting the warden.

1002
01:43:10,393 --> 01:43:12,478
That will do.

1003
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:37,754
Hurry up!
Want to stay here all night?

1004
01:43:39,297 --> 01:43:41,216
Come on, you son of a bitch.

1005
01:43:43,635 --> 01:43:44,635
Pull him up.

1006
01:43:47,555 --> 01:43:49,640
Harder!

1007
01:43:49,641 --> 01:43:50,725
I'm trying!

1008
01:43:54,896 --> 01:43:56,814
His legs! Legs!

1009
01:43:57,315 --> 01:43:58,733
You stupid morons.

1010
01:44:00,818 --> 01:44:01,986
Let him go!

1011
01:44:02,987 --> 01:44:04,489
Let him go, you fucker!

1012
01:44:06,491 --> 01:44:08,493
Turn the light on!

1013
01:44:08,826 --> 01:44:10,328
Nobody move!

1014
01:44:10,828 --> 01:44:12,080
Get him!

1015
01:44:12,413 --> 01:44:13,581
Don't move!

1016
01:44:35,353 --> 01:44:38,730
<i>Emergency! Man on the loose!</i>

1017
01:44:38,731 --> 01:44:40,649
<i>He's trying to escape
after killing an officer!</i>

1018
01:44:40,650 --> 01:44:44,403
<i>Blockade all exits and
cut off escape routes!</i>

1019
01:44:44,404 --> 01:44:46,906
<i>Shoot on sight!</i>

1020
01:44:47,323 --> 01:44:48,824
<i>Repeat.</i>

1021
01:44:48,825 --> 01:44:52,077
<i>There's a man on the loose!</i>

1022
01:44:52,078 --> 01:44:54,330
Nobody move! Search.

1023
01:44:59,002 --> 01:45:00,336
Move!

1024
01:45:07,051 --> 01:45:08,678
Shhh...

1025
01:45:09,345 --> 01:45:13,683
I must be out of my mind.

1026
01:45:14,350 --> 01:45:17,061
You know this is not really like me.

1027
01:45:17,729 --> 01:45:20,565
Don't ever tell anyone that I saved you.

1028
01:45:21,899 --> 01:45:23,735
What the heck did you do this time?

1029
01:45:24,652 --> 01:45:25,820
Listen.

1030
01:45:26,487 --> 01:45:28,488
- You should help me.
- No way!

1031
01:45:28,489 --> 01:45:31,492
I'm sorry but this
should be it between us.

1032
01:46:25,505 --> 01:46:27,924
Search harder, you assholes!

1033
01:46:28,841 --> 01:46:31,511
- How about the back gate?
- We're checking!

1034
01:46:32,929 --> 01:46:35,598
Back gate! Report on the situation!

1035
01:46:37,183 --> 01:46:39,434
<i>A fire broke out!</i>

1036
01:46:39,435 --> 01:46:42,145
<i>It's getting bigger and bigger here!</i>

1037
01:46:42,146 --> 01:46:43,481
It's collapsing!

1038
01:46:44,982 --> 01:46:47,819
<i>We'll extinguish a fire!</i>

1039
01:46:54,659 --> 01:46:58,662
<i>This is Central Fire Service. An
alarm has gone off at your location.</i>

1040
01:46:58,663 --> 01:47:02,666
Yes, it's not a fire. We're
fixing the incinerator.

1041
01:47:02,667 --> 01:47:05,502
<i>Take immediate action please.</i>

1042
01:47:05,503 --> 01:47:08,089
Yes, sir. We will.

1043
01:47:13,428 --> 01:47:19,100
<i>I heard an explosion. Are you okay?</i>

1044
01:47:19,767 --> 01:47:23,187
<i>Hello? Can you hear me?</i>

1045
01:47:23,771 --> 01:47:27,191
<i>Answer me. Sung-an Prison.</i>

1046
01:47:28,693 --> 01:47:31,028
Cut off all the connections.

1047
01:47:31,946 --> 01:47:34,949
And lock all the gates.

1048
01:47:36,117 --> 01:47:38,535
Open up House 8

1049
01:47:38,536 --> 01:47:41,705
and send everyone to extinguish the fire.

1050
01:47:41,706 --> 01:47:44,749
<i>A major fire broke out
at Sung-an Prison, sir.</i>

1051
01:47:44,750 --> 01:47:47,752
<i>Send in all available troops.</i>

1052
01:47:47,753 --> 01:47:50,256
How about Jeong? Have you found him yet?

1053
01:49:00,785 --> 01:49:02,119
What happened to that filthy rat?

1054
01:49:03,704 --> 01:49:04,704
Well...

1055
01:49:04,705 --> 01:49:06,040
Hey, Chief.

1056
01:49:06,958 --> 01:49:09,877
Do you want to be warden or not?

1057
01:49:11,963 --> 01:49:13,631
Catch that rat right now!

1058
01:49:14,799 --> 01:49:15,967
Fuck!

1059
01:50:42,470 --> 01:50:43,888
Great view, isn't it?

1060
01:50:53,064 --> 01:50:55,899
You're a lousy shot, I guess?

1061
01:50:55,900 --> 01:50:57,902
No fun killing you that easy.

1062
01:50:59,236 --> 01:51:02,114
Whoever you fight against,
hit the leader first.

1063
01:51:06,952 --> 01:51:08,079
Today...

1064
01:51:08,454 --> 01:51:10,790
I'll end this game, you son of a bitch!

1065
01:52:05,720 --> 01:52:06,887
Look, you bastard!

1066
01:52:08,472 --> 01:52:09,724
Everyone is watching!

1067
01:52:14,478 --> 01:52:16,981
I'm going to show everyone

1068
01:52:17,314 --> 01:52:19,233
how a scumbag like you ends up!

1069
01:52:34,331 --> 01:52:35,916
Let me go, assholes!

1070
01:52:39,545 --> 01:52:43,549
Blockade all the exits and
arrest everyone involved.

1071
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:53,851
Drop your weapon and surrender!

1072
01:53:00,983 --> 01:53:02,317
I repeat!

1073
01:53:02,318 --> 01:53:03,235
Drop your weapon!

1074
01:53:03,236 --> 01:53:07,156
Fuck off assholes! This is my territory!

1075
01:53:08,157 --> 01:53:12,161
The world I built, you shitheads!

1076
01:53:13,329 --> 01:53:15,331
No one can ruin it!

1077
01:53:17,333 --> 01:53:18,334
You fucker...

1078
01:53:40,898 --> 01:53:42,399
You motherfucker!

1079
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:46,987
You don't deserve to live, you scum!

1080
01:53:47,321 --> 01:53:49,156
Song Yu-gon, stop!

1081
01:53:50,491 --> 01:53:52,993
You didn't come in for that!

1082
01:53:55,246 --> 01:53:57,248
Lieutenant Song.

1083
01:53:58,332 --> 01:54:00,668
Think hard.

1084
01:54:03,504 --> 01:54:06,257
Drop it. You already did your job.

1085
01:54:06,423 --> 01:54:10,594
You think so?

1086
01:54:13,514 --> 01:54:15,182
No way!

1087
01:54:15,933 --> 01:54:17,518
Leave him to us, Yu-gon!

1088
01:54:18,185 --> 01:54:20,271
Do you believe in them?

1089
01:54:20,604 --> 01:54:23,607
Those bastards are nothing but idiots!

1090
01:54:42,334 --> 01:54:45,588
You stupid moron.

1091
01:54:47,923 --> 01:54:50,008
Son of a bitch!

1092
01:54:50,009 --> 01:54:51,427
Stand up, asshole!

1093
01:54:51,927 --> 01:54:53,095
Bastard!

1094
01:54:56,098 --> 01:54:57,932
You want to catch me?

1095
01:54:57,933 --> 01:55:00,019
What'll you do then, asshole?

1096
01:55:01,979 --> 01:55:07,151
You think there's a prison on
earth that can control me?

1097
01:55:21,582 --> 01:55:24,418
Sure, I know there isn't.

1098
01:55:27,338 --> 01:55:30,674
Go on. You're better suited to hell.

1099
01:56:53,716 --> 01:56:55,718
It was all your delusion.

1100
01:56:58,762 --> 01:57:00,514
This is just a prison.

1101
01:57:36,467 --> 01:57:37,885
We'll take him now.

1102
01:57:43,140 --> 01:57:44,308
Yu-gon.

1103
01:58:11,460 --> 01:58:12,628
Let's go.

1104
01:59:28,579 --> 01:59:31,582
I'll tell you the good news first.

1105
01:59:33,292 --> 01:59:36,294
Jung Ik-ho's outside connection,

1106
01:59:36,295 --> 01:59:38,714
Dr. Kim, was arrested in Osaka.

1107
01:59:38,755 --> 01:59:42,384
And Hwang's whereabouts
should be confirmed soon.

1108
01:59:42,718 --> 01:59:43,886
In addition...

1109
01:59:45,470 --> 01:59:48,890
all the cold cases will
be re-investigated.

1110
01:59:48,891 --> 01:59:51,226
Everyone involved will be summoned.

1111
01:59:53,312 --> 01:59:56,732
We'll get loads of work thanks to you.

1112
01:59:57,649 --> 02:00:01,612
And I can return this to you now.

1113
02:00:07,910 --> 02:00:09,744
What's the bad news?

1114
02:00:09,745 --> 02:00:11,914
It's about your actions in prison.

1115
02:00:12,748 --> 02:00:14,415
Suspicion of arson...

1116
02:00:14,416 --> 02:00:16,793
that one you've already admitted.

1117
02:00:17,586 --> 02:00:19,963
What troubles us more is...

1118
02:00:20,464 --> 02:00:23,550
Related prisoners and officers
have testified

1119
02:00:24,218 --> 02:00:27,303
you actively participated
in various crimes

1120
02:00:27,304 --> 02:00:31,808
as the close associate
of the main culprit, Jung Ik-ho.

1121
02:00:32,392 --> 02:00:35,229
Anything you want to say in your defense?

1122
02:00:37,814 --> 02:00:39,233
No.

1123
02:00:42,986 --> 02:00:45,989
<i>I think my part here is done.</i>

1124
02:00:47,574 --> 02:00:50,661
<i>I leave the rest of the
investigation to you.</i>

1125
02:00:51,662 --> 02:00:54,665
<i>I'm sorry to tell you...</i>

1126
02:00:54,998 --> 02:00:58,918
<i>even under these extenuated circumstances</i>

1127
02:00:58,919 --> 02:01:01,338
<i>you won't be able to avoid a conviction.</i>

1128
02:01:02,005 --> 02:01:03,674
<i>Can you accept that?</i>

1129
02:01:04,007 --> 02:01:05,342
<i>Sure.</i>

1130
02:01:06,343 --> 02:01:08,553
<i>In there too, people live...</i>

1131
02:01:09,054 --> 02:01:11,348
<i>and time passes the same.</i>
