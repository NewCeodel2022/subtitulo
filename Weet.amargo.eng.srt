00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:25,483
<i>What are you doing? Hurry!</i>

2
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,160
Mr. Lee. Mr. Lee?

3
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,370
Wake up. Mr. Lee.

4
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:25,835
NEW SNEAKERS

5
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:28,838
The jaundice is severe.

6
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,757
He has a high fever too.

7
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,343
This level of jaundice means
it's just the beginning.

8
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,346
The pain level should be at its peak.

9
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,847
Right.

10
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,849
-How do you know that?
-What?

11
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,644
Get back to your beds. Go on.

12
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:43,853
Okay.

13
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,772
Ms. Jung, I'm having trouble urinating…

14
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,649
-May I get some mist?
-It's normal.

15
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:49,943
-I keep drooling.
-It's okay.

16
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,236
Mr. Lee Jang-hyeok.

17
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,279
Mr. Lee Jang-hyeok.

18
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:56,366
Mr. Lee Jang-hyeok. Wake up.

19
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,034
You have to wake up.

20
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,245
-Mr. Lee Jang-hyeok.
-Yes?

21
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:01,913
Applicant number 2567,

22
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,998
Computer Engineering major,
Lee Jang-hyeok.

23
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,459
It's hard to find a job these days,
isn't it?

24
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,963
Your body must have gotten weak
from working so hard to find a job.

25
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,256
No.

26
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:12,632
I passed.

27
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,217
I got my acceptance letter.

28
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,887
Congratulations, Mr. Engineering.

29
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,014
Don't worry and rest. Okay?

30
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,289
Mom.

31
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:46,875
My goodness.

32
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,418
You look terrible.

33
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,586
Mom…

34
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,839
-My gosh. You've gotten so thin.
-Wait.

35
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:55,300
What is that? Mom?

36
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,759
Put your mask on.

37
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,681
Seriously. What are you doing?

38
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,150
Close the curtain.

39
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,903
What if we catch his hepatitis…
Or won't we?

40
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:19,532
We're in a hospital so it should be fine.

41
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,909
It's dry here.

42
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,706
Excuse me…

43
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,043
What?

44
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,963
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

45
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,340
See you.

46
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,134
Why is she always angry?

47
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,386
No. She looks pretty today.

48
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,429
What?

49
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:42,931
He's been here for too long.

50
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:46,643
Hey. Don't my hands look a little yellow?

51
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,269
-It's begun.
-What?

52
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,271
-How do you know?
-Here's your mask.

53
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,940
-I should have put it on earlier.
-Seriously…

54
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,359
Let me know if you need anything, okay?

55
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,236
I'll send you lots of good food.

56
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,779
You can stay.

57
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,489
Mommy loves you.

58
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,490
Daddy loves you too.

59
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,325
Seriously.

60
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,910
Hang in there, son!

61
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,745
Let's go. Hurry!

62
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,080
Leave the door open, will you?

63
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,164
Take him with you.

64
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,874
HYEOK'S HOSPITALIZED?
LET'S GO VISIT

65
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,794
I'LL BRING CHICKEN!
HE HAS HEPATITIS

66
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,128
IT'S OKAY, COME

67
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,422
I'LL PRAY FOR YOU FROM HERE
WE'LL VISIT IN SPIRIT

68
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,800
I LIKE YOU HEALTHY
CAN WE CATCH IT VIA CHAT?

69
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,093
BYE

70
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:22,845
INCHEON JUAN GENERAL HOSPITAL

71
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,070
Wait. Hey.

72
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,698
You shouldn't open the curtain.

73
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,575
-He has hepatitis. What if we catch it?
-It's dangerous.

74
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,911
You can't catch hepatitis from him.

75
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,079
How do you know that?

76
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:50,665
Isn't it super contagious?

77
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,418
He has hepatitis. It's not contagious.

78
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,461
Hepatitis B is not contagious.

79
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,423
-Am I really okay?
-What if we do, though?

80
00:04:58,506 --> 00:04:59,382
Close the curtain!

81
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,717
Fine! Okay!

82
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,677
I'm closing it for him.

83
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,346
-Close it all the way. Do it.
-I'm sure it's contagious?

84
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,267
It's bad enough that you're sick.

85
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,436
People can be so mean, right?

86
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,230
Don't worry about it, and relax.

87
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,650
I'll give you a special prescription
for a quick recovery.

88
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,744
I'M GLAD I GOT SICK

89
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,078
IS THE HOSPITAL FOOD GOOD?

90
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,247
I FEEL PROTECTED

91
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,332
DO YOU HAVE GOOD WIFI?

92
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,125
DO THEY HAVE A BIG CONVENIENCE STORE?

93
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,505
Shit. You scared me.

94
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,049
It was you, Mr. Engineering.

95
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,675
I thought you were the head nurse.

96
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,516
What? Is it weird seeing a nurse smoke?

97
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,226
No. It's cute.

98
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,778
It's my graduation ring.

99
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,656
I see.

100
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,618
Did you say you got a job?

101
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,579
-A permanent position?
-Yes.

102
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,747
Lucky you.

103
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,124
I'm on contract.

104
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,417
But they work me like a dog.
It's so annoying.

105
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,878
Have you been on eight-hour shifts?

106
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,005
You never recover from being tired.

107
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,174
I'm smoking this to wake myself up.

108
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,385
Who's smoking in here?

109
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:08,553
Sir.

110
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,096
You can't smoke in here.

111
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,640
If I catch you again,
I'll have you discharged.

112
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,934
Well, right…

113
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,270
I hate the smell of cigarette smoke.

114
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,066
Why does he have to smoke here?
I just don't get it.

115
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,694
Why are you smoking?

116
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,863
-Go back to your room!
-Okay.

117
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,956
All right. I won't open the curtain.

118
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,630
Thank you so much for yesterday.

119
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,924
They would have docked my pay
if they caught me.

120
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,051
It's okay.

121
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,096
Eat up. You have to eat a lot
to get better.

122
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,059
Eat up, okay?

123
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,144
Yes.

124
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,522
You shouldn't be a picky eater.

125
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:09,113
Oh, my gosh.
What the hell is wrong with me?

126
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,866
Oh, no.

127
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:15,369
I haven't eaten all day,
so I must have been hungry.

128
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,705
I'll buy you food next time.

129
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:18,998
I'm really sorry.

130
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,209
It's okay. You can eat with me.

131
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,421
Leave Mr. Engineering alone.

132
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,798
"Mr. Engineering"?

133
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,258
She took my chopsticks.

134
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:31,719
She's so cute.

135
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,932
Here, Hyeok.

136
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:42,396
You don't mind if I call you "Hyeok,"
do you?

137
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,232
No. Of course, not.

138
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,510
I'm so sleepy, Hyeok.

139
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,346
Let me stay here for a minute.

140
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,696
How long was I sleeping?

141
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,784
It hasn't even been a minute.

142
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,955
I MAY BE FLIRTING WITH A NURSE

143
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,665
YOU MUST STILL BE VERY SICK

144
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,001
IS SHE PRETTY?

145
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,502
I SHOULD FIND A COMMON INTEREST

146
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,963
YOU SHOULD GET OUT OF THERE
COME BACK TO REALITY

147
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,059
Jaundice!

148
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,354
Should you or should you not
be smoking here?

149
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:15,281
Damn it. What am I going to do?

150
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,123
I WON'T SMOKE AGAIN

151
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,010
PATIENT CALL

153
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,269
Thank you.

154
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,941
HOPE THIS FILLS YOU UP

155
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,537
TAKE A NAP! I'LL WAKE YOU

156
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,177
I slept for too long.

157
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:19,678
It was 172.

158
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,182
You slept for 2 minutes, 52 seconds.

159
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,687
Thank you, Hyeok.

160
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,025
{\an8}LEE JANG-HYEOK

00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,196
Two hundred and eighty-one…

162
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,156
two hundred and eighty-two…

163
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,075
two hundred and eighty-three…

164
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,910
two hundred and eighty-four.

165
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,161
Hundred and twenty-one…

166
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,746
Three hundred and fifty-nine…

167
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,164
Thousand and fifty-one…

168
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,251
GET HEALTHY!

169
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,883
{\an8}LEE JANG-HYEOK

170
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,395
He wants to get some fresh air.

171
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,313
I'll be back soon.

172
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,365
These Finnish macarons
are absolutely delicious.

173
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,491
Yes.

174
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,333
Where are my expensive Finnish macarons?

175
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,003
Give them back. They're a gift
for the head nurse.

176
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,963
-How should we know?
-You know my ginseng?

177
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,466
The one that costs 5,000 won.
That disappeared too.

178
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,886
It wasn't me.

179
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,304
Hey, Yellow! Did you see--

180
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,889
Stop it. It wasn't him.

181
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:47,057
-He doesn't step outside.
-It's probably him.

182
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,184
You should've told me.

183
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,977
-Are you accusing me?
-The head nurse…

184
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,187
Put your hand on this.

185
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,398
-Do I have to?
-Yes.

186
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:58,068
Have you ever touched someone else's food?

187
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,361
I have not!

188
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,906
See? I knew it was you!

189
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,991
-It was you wasn't it?
-I knew it!

190
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,868
Your mother is a great cook.

191
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,245
Your girlfriend is lucky.

192
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,080
No freaking way I have a girlfriend.

193
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,254
I can't stand people who talk like that.

194
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,100
Hey, Da-eun.

195
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,355
That patient's chart…

196
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,482
Da-eun. Da-eun…

197
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,698
-Hello.
-Hi.

198
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,575
Did you sleep well last night?

199
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,202
I was so tired that I just left.

200
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,496
How do you feel?

201
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,165
-I'm kind of gassy, but I'm fine.
-I had fun last night.

202
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,000
-You're gassy.
-You were great too.

203
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,669
Did you have <i>ramyeon</i> last night?

204
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:59,588
-You can't have flour-based food!
-A little. Just the broth.

205
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,216
-From what I saw yesterday…
-You had macarons before.

206
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,635
-You have to watch what you eat.
-What is he saying?

207
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,804
-It won't happen again.
-You shouldn't go easy…

208
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,515
How do you feel?

209
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:15,062
You should be able to go home
in a day or two.

210
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,231
What? In a day or two?

211
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,568
When should I discharge you?

212
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,822
Let's schedule your discharge
for the day after tomorrow.

213
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,532
The day after tomorrow?

214
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,659
Wait!

215
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:29,618
Yes?

216
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:35,499
I still don't feel well.

217
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,459
Can't I…

218
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,295
stay two or three more weeks?

219
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:43,132
You can go home and come in
for outpatient treatments.

220
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,175
Let's finish our team dinner quickly and…

221
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,724
What is wrong with you?

222
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,559
Even if he's a doctor, you shouldn't chat.

223
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:56,353
And what did you say to him
that he doesn't want to go home?

224
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,355
And you want to take a day off?

225
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,524
What?

226
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,322
Damn it.

227
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:10,826
I THINK I SHOULD ASK HER OUT

228
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,244
YOU NEED A RING THEN

229
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,704
SHE HAS ONE ALREADY

230
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,706
OR MAYBE FLOWERS?

231
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,041
AT THIS HOUR?

232
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:18,417
WEREN'T YOU TALKING ABOUT A GAME?

233
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,252
STILL SICK, I SEE…

234
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,928
PATIENT CALL
LEE JANG-HYEOK

235
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:35,559
What?

236
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,478
It's nothing!

237
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:59,333
Son! Were you waiting for me?

238
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,335
You're looking good.

239
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,670
Why are you here?

240
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:03,671
Damn it.

241
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:07,883
He's upset.

242
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,679
He has his mom's temper.

243
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:18,477
Hyeok really must have been sick.
He lost so much weight.

244
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,146
It's the hospital food.
They're all low-sodium.

245
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,315
They say a low-sodium diet is dangerous.

246
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,067
Right. I hate low-sodium food.

247
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,610
Hyeok.

248
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,780
You don't think that nurse is real,
do you?

249
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:32,157
You were hallucinating
because you were sick.

250
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,243
We don't get girls like that.

251
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,329
What do you mean? Da-eun likes me so much!

252
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,039
So, you named her Da-eun.

253
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,709
Are you sure it isn't "Da-eun-chan"?

254
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,460
Damn it.

255
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,504
Hey! That's not cooked yet.

256
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,549
-You'll end up in the hospital again.
-That's what I want!

257
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,307
EMERGENCY DIRECTORY

258
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:00,144
"Jung Da-eun."

259
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,270
Here it is.

260
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,230
It's 010-6687…

261
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,232
-What are you doing?
-What?

262
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,027
What?

263
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,654
I've missed you!

264
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,323
It's 010-6687…

265
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,408
So you're here.

266
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,327
It's 010-6687…

267
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,912
Is this Jung Da-eun's phone?

268
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,748
It's 6687…

269
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,333
Hello?

270
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,335
I'm sorry.

271
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,672
Six, six, eight, seven…

272
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:34,511
<i>Hello?</i>

273
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,141
<i>Hello?</i>

274
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,728
-Hyeok?
-What?

275
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:46,106
Yes, it's me. Lee Jang-hyeok.

276
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:49,902
How did you get my number?

277
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,028
Well…

278
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:53,197
I went to the hospital yesterday,

279
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,991
<i>and you weren't there, so…</i>

280
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,621
I took a few days off
because I wasn't feeling well.

281
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:01,663
What?

282
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:05,667
Are you okay now? What's wrong?

283
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,336
I'm fine.

284
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,422
Thank God.

285
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,133
<i>Thank God, you're okay.</i>

286
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,055
Why did you call me?

287
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:23,227
Well… So…

288
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,773
What do you think about me?

289
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:29,691
Excuse me?

290
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:33,028
<i>You weren't nice to me
only because I was a patient, right?</i>

291
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,072
<i>Actually, Da-eun…</i>

292
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,117
I like you very, very much.

293
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:44,957
Do you want to come over?

294
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,334
Sorry?

295
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,628
<i>I'm home alone right now.</i>

296
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,006
Do you want to come over?

297
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,343
What is it, son?

298
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,220
I'm taking the car!

299
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,264
What did he say?

300
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,682
He's taking the car.

301
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,267
What?

302
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,727
Hey! Why are you taking the car?

303
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,240
VITAMIN DRINK

304
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,533
Hello.

305
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,201
You got here so quickly.

306
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,287
Here.

307
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,415
You didn't have to.

308
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,293
Come in.

309
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,535
-Why are you standing there?
-What?

310
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,370
Come and sit.

311
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,580
Okay.

312
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,192
I'm sorry for coming so late.

313
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,071
I told you to come.

314
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:40,989
Yes.

315
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:48,580
Your perm looks very pretty.

316
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,961
You should rest. I'll go now.

317
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,587
Do you want to sleep over?

318
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:58,715
Excuse me?

319
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,553
Stay with me.

320
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,733
I really wanted to sleep
holding you tight like this.

321
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:24,950
What are you doing?

322
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,576
I'm sorry.

323
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,078
I didn't mean to.

324
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:30,789
How could you make a mistake like that?

325
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,460
SON, WHY AREN'T YOU BACK YET?

326
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:39,006
DAD CAN'T SLEEP BECAUSE OF THE CAR!

327
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,515
Hyeok?

328
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,728
Are you up?

329
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,607
I saw seaweed on the table.

330
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:16,001
Thank you for changing the light bulb.

331
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,252
What?

332
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,718
Wait.

333
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:27,012
No. It's not like that.

334
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,513
No.

335
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,001
He dies.

336
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,004
Him.

337
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:13,850
Hey.

338
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:15,644
Are you seeing someone?

339
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,187
Yes.

340
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,232
Liar.

341
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:21,983
It's true, Dad.

342
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:26,279
-Da-eun, are you good with assault rifles?
-Not really.

343
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,490
Damn it, that fatty.

344
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:31,701
Da-eun!

345
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,787
My girlfriend Da-eun!

346
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,164
Okay, I'll call you.

347
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,332
You should go.

348
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:38,333
That's a luxury car.

349
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,001
Really? Is it expensive?

350
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,169
Yes. That's…

351
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,672
Da-eun, who's fatter? Him or me?

352
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:48,176
You're so cute.
Why are you even comparing?

353
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,137
Really?

354
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,350
I NEVER GET TO SEE MY SON ANYMORE

355
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:56,351
HEY, YOU PUNK!

356
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:59,020
BRING BACK THE CAR!

357
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,731
Da-eun, where's your ring?

358
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,568
I lost it.

359
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,029
I took it off for a bit,
and I don't know where it went.

360
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,532
I see.

361
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,202
DID YOU USE MY CREDIT CARD AGAIN?

362
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,495
BRING BACK MY CAR!!!

363
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,496
<i>Da-eun.</i>

364
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,957
You should quit your job
once I find my own place.

365
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,459
It breaks my heart
to see you working so hard.

366
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,886
You can hug me.

367
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:38,727
-Damn it.
<i>-Headshot!</i>

368
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,811
She's really good.

369
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,355
Don't ask her to play again, you fatty.

370
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,862
-Hyeok.
-Yes?

371
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:51,948
Someone I know says they'll give me
their vacation package to Jeju.

372
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,325
Want to go with me?

373
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:54,326
What?

374
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:59,331
I should look up
some nice restaurants there.

375
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,003
This is the largest they have.

376
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:07,380
-Should we get this as our matching shirt?
-Sure.

377
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:08,924
-It's adorable.
-It looks fine.

378
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:12,052
This looks perfect on you.

379
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,470
Let's have some macarons.

380
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,181
Try this one.

381
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:18,642
Try it.

382
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:20,477
No, I'm not eating them anymore.

383
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,436
Why not?

384
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,771
I won't.

385
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,648
Didn't you come once before?

386
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,401
Since you came before,
I'll give it to you for 5,000 won.

387
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:29,736
-Really?
-Yes.

388
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,655
-Thank you.
-Good night.

389
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:51,466
Wait.

390
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:53,343
I'll get off here.

391
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:55,762
Da-eun!

392
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:59,307
Da-eun! Sorry.

393
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,434
My dad hid the car key.

394
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,603
I should've picked you up,

395
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:06,106
but my dad said he'd kill me
if I took the car again.

396
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,315
Ta-da.

397
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,193
Do you like them?

398
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:13,613
Did you get us matching sneakers
because we couldn't get matching shirts?

399
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,073
No.

400
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,534
I thought these would look good on you.

401
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,372
Do you like them?

402
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:23,707
Yes, totally.

403
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,668
Da-eun. Let's go to Jeju again
next Christmas as well.

404
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:30,255
I'll wear these sneakers that you got me,
and lose all this weight,

405
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:32,757
so that we can wear
matching shirts next year.

406
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,342
I promise I'll lose weight. Okay?

407
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:38,346
Look, Da-eun.
I'll really lose weight, okay?

408
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:01,119
<i>I really am going to lose weight.</i>

409
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:02,829
<i>I'll do it.</i>

410
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:25,685
OLD SNEAKERS

411
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:45,872
What is that? Egg souffle?

412
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,123
You're good.

413
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:50,085
-What time are you going today?
-At three.

414
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:57,425
Eight-hour shifts are hell.

415
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,510
See you.

416
00:27:58,593 --> 00:27:59,469
Bye.

417
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,263
Hyeok!

418
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,848
Hold on.

419
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,231
No. Take out the recycling.

420
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:12,816
Okay.

421
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:18,655
Okay.

422
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:19,989
-My goodness.
-Is it heavy?

423
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,199
No. See you later.

{\an8}MAKE RECYCLING A WAY OF LIFE
AND SAVE THE WORLD ONE STEP AT A TIME

425
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:35,380
Damn it, what the hell?

426
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,979
But I'm busy…

427
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,066
I'm being dispatched?

428
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,402
Don't scare me like that.

429
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,946
What do you mean, a large corporation?

430
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:01,531
I'm not kidding.

431
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:04,451
I only said "dispatch" earlier
because of the others.

432
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:07,537
You'll be a permanent employee
at a large corporation.

433
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,497
Don't think about anything else

434
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,999
and just work your tail off

435
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,042
when you get there.

436
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,794
It's not like I'm happy

437
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,130
to lose one of my own.

438
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:22,051
Do you think I can do it?

439
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,344
Listen.

440
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,638
You're talented.

441
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:30,477
You'll do better than okay there.

442
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,063
I want you to succeed in a better place.

443
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,232
That's why I'm sending you.

444
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:37,650
Chief…

445
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,110
Yes.

446
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:45,200
-I'll do my best.
-Okay.

447
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,327
-Wish me luck.
-Good luck.

448
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:50,079
He practically begged me.

449
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:53,082
"It's a great opportunity.
You have to go."

450
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,503
A large corporation wants me.

451
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:01,382
They're finally appreciating
what I can do.

452
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:06,054
That's great.

453
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:10,600
What's wrong?

454
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,311
Should I not go?

455
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:18,107
You should.
It's a great opportunity for you, Hyeok.

456
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,944
Of course. It's a great opportunity.

457
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,737
For me, and for you.

458
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:23,696
For us both--

459
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,407
But Hyeok. Shouldn't you consult with me--

460
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,535
Look at her.

461
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,578
Is she dating at the hospital?

462
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,497
-I have to go.
-Look at them all lovey-dovey.

463
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,791
-Throw that out for me.
-I'm not done eating.

464
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,260
See you later.

465
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,344
Hang in there.

466
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:47,512
Give me a break.

467
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:50,473
Doesn't he look familiar?

468
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:51,933
Right?

469
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,185
He seems so familiar.

470
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,986
Da-eun, are you good with assault rifles?

471
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:07,031
-That fatty is still…
-Then did you always play sniper?

472
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:14,205
-Go on.
-So you always played a sniper.

473
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,248
-We're off.
-Bye.

474
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:17,458
-I'll call you. Sniper?
-Okay.

475
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,130
There.

476
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,091
What's this?

477
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:27,427
I felt bad borrowing my dad's car
all the time,

478
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,678
so I bought my own.

479
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:30,889
Can you afford it?

480
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,223
-Get in first.
-But…

481
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:33,975
It's fine.

482
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:45,403
You haven't had a ring
since you lost your graduation ring.

483
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:46,946
So I got it for you.

484
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:49,240
It's so pretty.

485
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:52,493
Thank you.

486
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,165
You don't have to worry anymore.

487
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,959
I have a car now,
so I'll come back and forth every day.

488
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:01,794
Don't worry, okay?

489
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:15,558
<i>It's a clear Monday,
but commuting to work is still a chore.</i>

490
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:18,353
<i>There's quite a lot of traffic
on Gyeongin Expressway</i>

491
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,438
-<i>towards Seoul.</i>
-Damn traffic…

492
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:23,608
-<i>Sinwol IC to Seoul and Yeouido</i>
-Damn it.

493
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,568
<i>is also jammed up with traffic.</i>

494
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,445
<i>It will take a couple of hours…</i>

495
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:30,448
They should have gotten up earlier.

496
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,421
Excuse me. I was dispatched--

497
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,487
Good morning.

498
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:14,951
Ma'am. Let me introduce the new members
added to the team for this project.

499
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:18,371
No. Lee…

500
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:19,998
-It's Jang…
-Lee Jang-hyeok.

501
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,499
-It's--
-Nice to meet you.

502
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:22,500
Hello.

503
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,421
Introduce yourself.

504
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,673
I'm Han Bo-yeong. It's nice to meet you.

505
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,050
Let's "cheer up" together.

506
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,135
Yes.

507
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,220
Let's do this.

508
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:44,689
What the…

509
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,578
Gosh…

510
00:33:58,661 --> 00:33:59,746
-<i>What the hell?</i>
-What?

511
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,581
There's one more person here.

512
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:02,582
<i>Really?</i>

513
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,877
Large corporations sure are different.

514
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,253
They're not easy.

515
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,047
What the heck is this?

516
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,840
<i>Just take it easy then.</i>

517
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:12,508
Your job's still here.

518
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:15,303
I bought a car
and even rented a place in Seoul.

519
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,138
-I can't go back.
-<i>Gosh.</i>

520
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:20,892
Then you'll have to do well
if you want to stay there.

521
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,104
Damn it.

522
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,950
What about Chinese today?

523
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,786
Yes. I think rice will be good.

524
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:44,040
I don't crave any Korean food today.

525
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,002
What the…

526
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,765
She's always scowling.

527
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:03,684
Don't be like that.
You just have to do a better job.

528
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,479
You're colleagues, so be nice.

529
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:08,231
Congrats on your first day of work.

530
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:10,608
Cheers.

531
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:17,490
You can just get closer to people
and make them appreciate your worth.

532
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:21,911
One, two, three, four…

533
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:23,162
What the…

534
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,248
Do you need help?

535
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,125
No. I'm fine.

536
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,836
-Have some coffee.
-Bo-yeong.

537
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,380
-It's Americano.
-Appreciate it.

538
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,506
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

539
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:35,383
-Thanks.
-Here you go.

540
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:36,926
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

541
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,719
Sir. Here's some coffee.

542
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,263
Thank you, Bo-yeong.

543
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:46,310
What are you--

544
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:56,863
Hey.

545
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,740
Shouldn't you tell them
that I bought them?

546
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:02,577
What?

547
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,164
I was just helping.

548
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:10,042
I guess you want to brag
that you bought coffee.

549
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,753
I'm sorry.

550
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,506
I should just let you spill the coffee
next time.

551
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,352
What's this?

552
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:31,731
They said the bridge was urgent,
not the substructure.

553
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,233
Didn't you hear during the meeting?

554
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,568
I know.

555
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:37,403
I was just checking it out.

556
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:39,238
You should thank me.

557
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:40,573
You almost got in trouble.

558
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:49,749
That was close.

559
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:52,835
Jang-hyeok. Don't you see everyone else
sketching the substructure?

560
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:55,713
You're the only one working on the bridge.

561
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,300
Pay attention to what I say.

562
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:02,553
Hey.

563
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,643
Hey.

564
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,103
What are you--

565
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,238
It's a woman?

566
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,240
That crazy person?

567
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,783
If it were a guy, I would've…

568
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:25,993
She sounds like she's no joke.

569
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,912
It must be so hard for you.

570
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,330
You know I hate sweets.

571
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,832
Yes. You absolutely hate it
in case you gain weight.

572
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,919
She shoved a candy in my mouth.
A mint candy of all things.

573
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:36,254
She did?

574
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,881
She must be crazy. What's her problem?

575
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:41,342
-She's crazy.
-She really is a weirdo.

576
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:47,848
We got this patient today, and--

577
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,141
I'm so pissed off.

578
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,103
I don't know what to do.

579
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:56,357
Shouldn't we book now
if we want to go to Jeju for Christmas?

580
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,401
You take care of it.

581
00:37:58,484 --> 00:37:59,777
Come here.

582
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:01,570
In a minute.

583
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,155
Come here.

584
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,116
Let me think. Give me one minute.

585
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,201
How do I get back at her?

586
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:14,667
Nice.

587
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,504
Who came up with this creative idea?

588
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:24,635
Bo-yeong.

589
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:27,596
She just got here.

590
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,349
Thank you.

591
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:31,851
Excuse me.

592
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:37,857
There's a problem with that structure.

593
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:38,858
What?

594
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:41,193
That is a flood zone.

595
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,487
There's a risk of the bridge collapsing.

596
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,615
I believe the bridge design

597
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,410
should be completely reexamined.

598
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,374
WARNING

599
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,421
So…

600
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,882
This isn't the final version,
so we'll restructure it

601
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:05,343
and revise the design a little…

602
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,261
What's the English word for that?

603
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:11,599
Yes, we'll "crystal" it
before the deadline.

604
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:12,808
-It should be fine.
-Okay.

605
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:16,771
Why don't the two new employees
work on this?

606
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,357
We can see what your abilities are like.

607
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,735
-You are excellent and--
-Shall we go?

608
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:23,652
Shall we…

609
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:29,033
Give us some time,
and we'll do it again and make it perfect.

610
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:37,541
This will collapse.

611
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:39,668
Good luck.

612
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:44,632
That little…

613
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:48,052
No. It's too weak.

614
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,720
What is this?

615
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,140
Damn it.

616
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,560
Is this that hard?

617
00:39:58,854 --> 00:39:59,855
What?

618
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:08,030
Let's get moving.

619
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,240
I need to go home.

620
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:34,932
She's so gross.

621
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:39,437
I'M DONE NOW. WHEN ARE YOU DONE?

622
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,189
I'LL HEAD OUT NOW

623
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,816
I'm going home.

624
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:46,277
You can finish it by morning, right?

625
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:51,574
-Why are you staring at me?
-I'm not looking at you.

626
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:53,826
You must be cross-eyed.

627
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,703
Good bye.

628
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,749
-Are you going to leave her like that?
-Pardon?

629
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,253
-On purpose?
-What…

630
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,132
You're good at this.

631
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:09,925
Good.

632
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:13,762
What the hell?

633
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,060
Move, will you?

634
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:23,606
Da-eun!

635
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:25,065
Jung Da-eun!

636
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,026
-I totally got revenge.
-Hey.

637
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:34,783
Wash up.

638
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:37,411
-In a minute.
-No. Wash up.

639
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,580
-In a minute.
-Please?

640
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,712
In a bit.

641
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,105
Da-eun.

642
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:09,818
Sorry. I must've been
too exhausted last night.

643
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:14,907
<i>Isn't it too hard to commute from Incheon?</i>

644
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:18,160
<i>If you get off work too late,</i>

645
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,704
we can meet this weekend.
I might have a day off.

646
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,289
You don't need to come every day.

647
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,374
Really?

648
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:25,251
<i>Yes, it's fine.</i>

649
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:27,169
Okay, then. I'll see you this weekend.

650
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:28,712
-Okay.
-<i>Okay.</i>

651
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:36,845
What the…

652
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,812
How frightening.

653
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:00,494
Okay.

654
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:08,419
Hold on.

655
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:14,133
What is that foul smell?

656
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:19,930
Don't eat in the conference room.
No eating.

657
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:28,272
She's a tough one.

658
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:40,284
I'm so tired.

659
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:50,419
She's so gross.

660
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,218
We're still in here!

661
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,304
Why are they turning off the lights?

662
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:01,972
Turn on--

663
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:06,560
Hey, Mr. Jang.

664
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:10,689
I was just trying to lend you
a helping hand.

665
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:11,940
What?

666
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:16,111
You have to seize the opportunity
when it presents itself.

667
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:19,406
Only an amateur thinks too much
and misses out.

668
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,116
Just turn on the light.

669
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:27,539
Be a pro.

670
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:32,211
Seriously.

671
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:40,803
Seriously. She's so gross.

672
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:45,307
Excuse me. Either eat or work.
Just do one at a time.

673
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:49,395
I'm eating to stay awake, you prick!

674
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,564
Do you know how badly I want to go home?

675
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,234
Being dirty doesn't matter.

676
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:57,111
It's this bridge that matters.

677
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,195
This design!

678
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:00,280
Look how pretty this is.

679
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:04,284
I swear I'll make this work
and leave it looking pretty.

680
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,703
You're the reason I can't go home.

681
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:08,247
Who cares if I'm dirty?

682
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:20,717
Just do this.

683
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:30,519
I'M OFF TOMORROW. YOU CAN COME, RIGHT?

684
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:37,651
YOU MUST BE BUSY

685
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:50,998
You need good talent
to refresh the company.

686
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,709
Our team members should hurry
and catch up.

687
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:56,253
Regardless, we got a good result,

688
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:58,630
-so take the team out.
-Thank you.

689
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:01,133
Thank you, boss.

690
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:04,011
Please take a shower.

691
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,388
I beg you.

692
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:09,892
Please?

693
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:12,269
I like that bridge so much.

694
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:17,691
I'LL BE DONE SOON. YOU'RE COMING, RIGHT?

695
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:19,109
I'M AT A COMPANY DINNER
I'LL LEAVE SOON

696
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:22,446
I MISS YOU SO MUCH, DA-EUN

697
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,494
You got some on you.

698
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:35,375
Damn it.

699
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,085
-Have a drink.
-Excuse me?

700
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,003
Have a drink.

701
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:41,089
I've injured my liver.

702
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:45,177
I don't think I should drink.

703
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,929
-I'm sorry.
-Okay.

704
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:48,847
-Funny. You're funny.
-I'm sorry.

705
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:50,140
It must have been serious.

706
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:55,521
Slow down.

707
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:59,358
Calm down.

708
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:02,611
-Why does he care?
-Bo-yeong. Jang-hyeok.

709
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:04,613
-Yes, sir.
-Quickly. Come on.

710
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:06,365
Come here. Come.

711
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:07,783
You leave.

712
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:12,579
Sir. Let me pour you a drink.

713
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:13,789
-Okay.
-Good.

714
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,625
-Bo-yeong.
-Please pour me one too.

715
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:18,335
Okay, Bo-yeong.

716
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,135
Slow down.

717
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:29,972
You two have such great chemistry.
It's good.

718
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:32,766
Keep cooperating together

719
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:36,186
and work on the next
underground project together.

720
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,107
Wait, sir. Our team is already
working on that.

721
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:45,571
Keep making a good impression

722
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,030
-on the team.
-Stop drinking too much.

723
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:48,782
What's another word for "impression"?

724
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:51,285
That's right.

725
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:54,663
-Keep making a good face on the team.
-Don't drink too much.

726
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:58,083
Then we'll continue to have
a good relationship.

727
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:00,127
Pour me one please.

728
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,878
-One more? Okay.
-Okay!

729
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:07,634
You're drinking too much…

730
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,678
-Me too?
-Let me pour you one.

731
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:19,438
Sir. Where did you learn English?

732
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:22,816
Your English is so good.
Your pronunciation is…

733
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:24,735
like a Japanese police officer
from the colonial era.

734
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:27,279
But your choice of words
is Korean-American.

735
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:28,864
You know a lot of words.

736
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:32,451
But your pronunciation is like…

737
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:34,036
a pro-Japanese collaborator!

738
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:35,454
A pro-Japanese collaborator!

739
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:36,788
A pro-Japanese collaborator!

740
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:38,332
-A pro-Japanese collaborator!
-She's drunk.

741
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,584
I'll take her outside.

742
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:42,002
I hate pro-Japanese collaborator!

743
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:43,378
What's that in English?

744
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:45,505
I'm not drunk!

745
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:47,633
One more soju!

746
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,387
Why is there so much traffic at this hour?

747
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:00,687
Da-eun.

748
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,191
Jung Da-eun.

749
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:07,444
The head nurse suddenly changed
my day off again.

750
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:09,571
It's so annoying.

751
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:10,864
<i>I'm working tonight again.</i>

752
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:15,911
Sorry. I wanted to see you.

753
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:19,539
-Okay.
-<i>Right.</i>

754
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,458
Rest up and go to work.

755
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:24,503
Also, I bought a new light bulb.
Can you change it?

756
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:27,798
<i>Okay.</i>

757
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:32,844
I'll do it tomorrow.

758
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:34,888
I can't even move.

759
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,557
I'm so tired. I can't right now.

760
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,904
I didn't do anything stupid last night,
right?

761
00:49:50,987 --> 00:49:51,822
What?

762
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:53,782
Don't you remember?

763
00:49:58,745 --> 00:49:59,705
I took a shower.

764
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:02,082
Don't I smell nice?

765
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:06,169
Come to my desk, both of you.

766
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:09,923
I want you two to take over everything
the Project Team Three had been doing.

767
00:50:10,006 --> 00:50:11,842
I'll tell them to hand over the project.

768
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:14,469
It was frustrating to watch them work.

769
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:16,263
I'm so glad that you two are here.

770
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:18,682
-Hello.
-Hello.

771
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:19,850
Hello.

772
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:21,935
-Good morning.
-Hello.

773
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:26,440
Hey.

774
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:29,401
Hey.

775
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:34,197
I like it

776
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:38,201
when you support me from behind.

777
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,371
What do you say?
You like working with me, right?

778
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:44,458
Yes.

779
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:52,549
A support system or a service zone
would be good here.

780
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:55,635
I think it'll look more bountiful.

781
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:14,905
I CAN'T MAKE IT TONIGHT

782
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:19,367
IT'S SUPER SLOW
SINCE IT'S JUST TWO OF US WORKING

783
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:20,869
Let's go.

784
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:23,330
What should we eat?

785
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:24,623
Pork trotters!

786
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:25,707
Pork trotters?

787
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,417
-Yes. Pork trotters.
-Pork trotters!

788
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:37,135
ARE YOU VERY BUSY AGAIN TODAY?

789
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:38,345
YEAH, I'M DYING HERE

790
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:04,830
IS IT JUST YOU TWO AGAIN TONIGHT?

791
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:06,706
YES, I'M WORKING TONIGHT AGAIN

792
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:07,958
I NEED TO

793
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:10,085
Hey. Get off your phone.

794
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:11,545
I'm sorry.

795
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:14,464
I NEED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING

796
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:17,259
COME TONIGHT NO MATTER HOW LATE IT IS

797
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:19,052
SORRY! I NEED TO PULL AN ALL-NIGHTER

798
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:22,639
I PROMISE I'LL GO TOMORROW!

799
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,315
Him again? Seriously.

800
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,841
What are you doing, Hyeok?

801
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:02,929
Shit…

802
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,474
YOU'LL COME TOMORROW, RIGHT?

803
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:08,602
YES! I PROMISE I'LL BE THERE TOMORROW!

804
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:11,521
SEE YOU TOMORROW. MISS YOU

805
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,857
I MISS YOU TOO, DA-EUN

806
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:21,197
A bridge that connects nature.

807
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:25,702
With this bridge,
nature and the city become one.

808
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:28,496
What do you think, boss?

809
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:35,170
It's good.

810
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:36,212
Let's go for it.

811
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:43,511
Our aces.

812
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:52,354
Send these to the team,
let's move on to the next stage!

813
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:55,982
Let's go.

814
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:58,151
Well done.

815
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:06,409
Let's grab a drink tonight.

816
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,036
Just us contract workers.

817
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:10,538
I'm the manager, so I'll buy.

818
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:16,419
Sure. Let's do that.

819
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,798
You drink soju bombs, right?

820
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:23,134
-I'm driving.
-Don't be lame. Call a designated driver.

821
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:30,433
That's too much soju.

822
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:31,768
Just drink.

823
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:35,230
You know, I like the way you work.

824
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:37,649
Except how humorless you are.

825
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:39,651
Here.

826
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:54,124
Maybe it has been too long since I drank.

827
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,917
I'm getting drunk.

828
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:57,836
Stop drinking.

829
00:54:57,919 --> 00:54:58,962
Damn it.

830
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:00,588
Why should I stop?

831
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:02,215
MY LOVE DA-EUN

832
00:55:03,341 --> 00:55:05,051
I'll be right back.

833
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:08,263
Hi, Da-eun.

834
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:10,098
<i>Where are you?</i>

835
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,267
<i>When are you coming?</i>

836
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:15,937
I'm not done with work yet.

837
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:17,480
You're still working?

838
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:19,190
<i>Yeah, I'm not done yet.</i>

839
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,776
So you can't come tonight?

840
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:25,071
<i>I told you I have something important
to tell you. Can't you come late?</i>

841
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:28,033
I should go even if it's late, but…

842
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:31,411
I'm with my boss and everyone.

843
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:33,038
<i>I don't think I can go.</i>

844
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:36,666
You sound like you're outside. It's noisy.

845
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,668
Yes, we're eating right now.

846
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:40,837
My boss is in the groove,

847
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:43,840
so he won't stop talking.

848
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:46,593
-Okay.
-<i>Sorry.</i>

849
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:47,510
It's okay.

850
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:50,680
-<i>I need to get back.</i>
-Okay.

851
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:51,723
Sorry.

852
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:52,766
<i>Okay.</i>

853
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:58,521
Why were you on the phone for so long?

854
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:00,940
Let's drink.

855
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:04,903
Bottoms up.

856
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:25,548
I think it'll be better to secure this
and this. What do you think?

857
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,509
I like it a lot.

858
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:29,010
What about you?

859
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:46,986
Why did the lights go out?

860
00:56:57,705 --> 00:56:59,374
I think…

861
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:04,796
we should be a little bolder.

862
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:12,595
I should go home.

863
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:15,098
There should be a traffic jam.

864
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:16,474
-I should hurry.
-What the hell?

865
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:17,392
Wait…

866
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:19,978
Where are you going?

867
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:23,106
-Hey, Mr. Jang.
-Damn it.

868
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:24,232
-Hey, Mr. Jang. Hold on.
-Damn it.

869
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:26,734
-Hang on a second. You can't go like this.
-Get away!

870
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,156
You'll be frustrated

871
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:33,700
if you leave like this.

872
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,835
This is so frustrating.

873
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:47,964
There's so much traffic.

874
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:53,303
Hey.

875
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:56,764
Will you take out the trash out front?

876
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:02,604
I'll take it out later.

877
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:06,191
Just take it out now.

878
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:08,776
You're going to wash up
and go right to sleep.

879
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,487
I'm really tired. I'll do it later.

880
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,947
You still haven't changed the light bulb.

881
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:14,741
Just take it out now.

882
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:17,952
I will do it, but…

883
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:22,081
Do you have to talk about the trash
as soon as I walk in?

884
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:23,249
Look.

885
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,251
I've been working night shifts lately

886
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:27,337
and just got back. I'm exhausted too.

887
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,964
Why are you being so irritable
about the trash?

888
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:34,093
Hey. I came, didn't I?

889
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:38,223
You're being irritable
about the trash and the bulb.

890
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:40,391
Don't you see me?
Aren't you happy to see me?

891
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:43,728
Are you here to rest or to see me?

892
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:45,563
Is this a motel?

893
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:48,775
Why are you twisting my words?

894
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:52,737
I'm tired because there was
so much freaking traffic coming here.

895
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:55,782
Why are you so self-centered?

896
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:57,659
I'm self-centered?

897
00:58:57,742 --> 00:58:59,577
Damn it.

898
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:04,666
Seriously.

899
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:08,044
I haven't gotten my period.

900
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:10,338
What do you mean?

901
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:12,340
I haven't gotten my period.

902
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:21,724
Have you seen a doctor?

903
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:23,434
Did you take one of those tests…

904
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:27,272
Seriously.
When do I have time to see a doctor?

905
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:32,527
Then…

906
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:35,029
I'll take out the trash.

907
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:08,396
The retail facilities…

908
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:12,400
Focus. Don't you want to go home?

909
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:14,569
Sorry.

910
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:24,662
I WENT TO THE DOCTOR

911
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:33,463
What did they say?

912
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:34,964
<i>I'm four weeks pregnant.</i>

913
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,895
Do you know how wide we need to make it?

914
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:37,985
Awesome! What are the chances?

915
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:40,029
Sorry about that.

916
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:43,282
Hey!

917
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,326
Either eat or work.

918
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:54,335
You haven't had dinner yet,
so I was peeling it for you.

919
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:57,338
I'm sorry, Hyeok.

920
01:01:57,422 --> 01:01:59,215
Are you angry?

921
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:00,591
Don't be mad.

922
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:07,557
Sorry for getting mad.

923
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:11,310
It's okay.

924
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:13,938
You were kind of…

925
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:23,239
Damn it. Seriously.

926
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:24,907
We're in here.

927
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,620
Our fourth quarter performance is very,
very terrible.

928
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:30,997
We have to finish quickly

929
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,708
so the other teams get the chance
to do other work.

930
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:37,295
The waterfront park, bridge,
and the underground mall.

931
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:39,213
We gave them all to other teams.

932
01:02:45,344 --> 01:02:47,555
Why won't they move?

933
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:50,349
Damn it.

934
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:11,412
Quiet down.

935
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:13,581
You're dead.

936
01:03:13,664 --> 01:03:17,001
-You lose. If you don't play…
-I win.

937
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,465
Move over a little, will you?

938
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:27,637
Did you come with a guardian?

939
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:32,683
Please write down the guardian's name
at the bottom.

940
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:53,871
Hyeok, wait in the car.

941
01:03:53,955 --> 01:03:54,789
What?

942
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:57,208
No. I should be with you.

943
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:58,709
I can manage on my own.

944
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:00,127
I'm a nurse.

945
01:04:02,421 --> 01:04:04,507
It's fine. Go.

946
01:04:05,299 --> 01:04:07,552
-I'll be in the car then.
-Okay, go.

947
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:09,929
Go on.

948
01:04:17,311 --> 01:04:20,815
HWANG OB-GYN

949
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:40,626
Let's go home.

950
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:57,101
How annoying.

951
01:05:15,286 --> 01:05:16,829
Don't you have to go?

952
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:19,206
It's okay. I took the day off.

953
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:20,416
I don't have to go.

954
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:24,378
Whatever. I don't have to go.

955
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:25,922
Whatever.

956
01:05:28,966 --> 01:05:30,760
Whatever. I don't care.

957
01:05:30,843 --> 01:05:32,511
Isn't that work?

958
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:33,596
It is.

959
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:36,182
But you don't have to go?

960
01:05:36,807 --> 01:05:38,309
No, it's fine.

961
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:41,604
You should go. They need you.

962
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:44,815
I can't go. I should stay with you.

963
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:46,025
It's okay.

964
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:48,569
You need to impress them.

965
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:52,949
Are you sure?

966
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:54,742
Yes.

967
01:05:54,825 --> 01:05:56,744
I can't go.

968
01:05:57,578 --> 01:05:59,580
No. I can't go. I won't.

969
01:05:59,664 --> 01:06:01,040
It's okay.

970
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:04,585
I'm not in pain.
I'm just a little down, that's all.

971
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:08,172
Are you sure?

972
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:10,675
Yes.

973
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:14,971
Then…

974
01:06:15,721 --> 01:06:17,723
There's something important going on.

975
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:20,810
I'll take care of it quickly
and come back early.

976
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:23,562
Get some rest.

977
01:06:37,284 --> 01:06:38,953
I'm really sorry.

978
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:59,598
I CAN'T FOCUS ON WORK

979
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:02,935
I'M OKAY. WORK. I'M GOING TO SLEEP

980
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:04,895
ALREADY? I WAS JUST ABOUT TO HEAD OUT

981
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:07,690
THEN I'LL LEAVE WORK EARLY
AND GO OVER TOMORROW

982
01:07:07,773 --> 01:07:11,736
SHOULD I GET SOME PORRIDGE?
OR DO YOU WANT SEAWEED SOUP?

983
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:15,698
YOU MUST BE SLEEPING. OKAY. REST

984
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:31,589
If we remove a floor here,
we can make the ceilings higher.

985
01:07:31,672 --> 01:07:33,215
Will that be okay?

986
01:07:35,092 --> 01:07:37,178
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

987
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:39,055
Sorry.

988
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:43,642
Wait…

989
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:45,394
INCHEON

990
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:53,444
Hey.

991
01:07:53,527 --> 01:07:54,695
Hi.

992
01:07:55,696 --> 01:07:57,073
I'm so tired.

993
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:58,240
You must be tired.

994
01:07:58,324 --> 01:07:59,200
Yes.

995
01:08:02,536 --> 01:08:05,331
Wouldn't it be fun to watch them live?

996
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:10,544
When will I ever be able to
have fun like them?

997
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:30,981
I'm leaving.

998
01:08:32,691 --> 01:08:34,652
When do you plan to finish this?

999
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:45,204
<i>-It's so pretty.</i>
-Will you have time on Christmas?

1000
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:47,164
We promised to go to Jeju.

1001
01:08:47,873 --> 01:08:49,083
<i>Get it for me.</i>

1002
01:08:50,584 --> 01:08:51,794
I should.

1003
01:09:02,179 --> 01:09:03,722
Rice puffs.

1004
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,307
Would you like some rice puffs?

1005
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:06,600
I have rice puffs.

1006
01:09:24,034 --> 01:09:25,161
Let's go.

1007
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:04,450
Damn it.

1008
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:06,911
<i>Why didn't you wake me before you left?</i>

1009
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:08,662
I left in the middle of the night.

1010
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:11,207
You were sound asleep, so I felt bad--

1011
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:13,876
I can't be late. I'm dead.

1012
01:10:13,959 --> 01:10:15,044
Why can't I get this?

1013
01:10:15,127 --> 01:10:16,629
<i>I'm hanging up!</i>

1014
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:23,177
It's so cold. Damn it.

1015
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:26,639
I'm sorry, sir.

1016
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:29,850
You've disappointed me.

1017
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:43,405
Sorry, but I'm going to go.

1018
01:10:49,286 --> 01:10:52,581
I told him we were here. He keeps…

1019
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:55,334
What the hell?

1020
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,378
Don't go today.

1021
01:10:58,295 --> 01:10:59,546
What?

1022
01:11:01,382 --> 01:11:02,883
I mean…

1023
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:05,761
We're working well together.

1024
01:11:05,844 --> 01:11:08,764
But we're moving slower than I expected.

1025
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:11,016
There's a lot we need to do,

1026
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:12,726
so we need to have meetings.

1027
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:15,187
If you keep this up,
we can't do our job well.

1028
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:17,564
We have to be together…

1029
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:20,567
What are you looking at?

1030
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:21,944
What? Nothing.

1031
01:11:22,027 --> 01:11:23,112
Are you listening?

1032
01:11:23,195 --> 01:11:24,029
Yes.

1033
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:28,117
If we mess up, we'll get yelled at.

1034
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,827
Then we may get fired.

1035
01:11:30,577 --> 01:11:32,997
That's not good.
We should keep working, right?

1036
01:11:33,914 --> 01:11:35,582
Okay. I'll work a little more.

1037
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:37,626
I won't leave.

1038
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:40,296
I JUST FINISHED

1039
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:42,840
I CAN'T GO. I HAVE TO WORK LATE

1040
01:11:43,507 --> 01:11:45,843
INCHEON CITY HOSPITAL

1041
01:11:45,926 --> 01:11:52,933
OKAY. DON'T WORK TOO LATE.
SEE YOU TOMORROW

1042
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,852
We need at least two more.

1043
01:11:54,935 --> 01:11:55,769
Two?

1044
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:01,317
It's good.

1045
01:12:02,776 --> 01:12:04,403
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1046
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:10,826
SORRY, I HAVE TO WORK LATE AGAIN

1047
01:12:10,909 --> 01:12:12,619
ME TOO. COME ON SATURDAY INSTEAD

1048
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:13,871
How about a dermatologist.

1049
01:12:13,954 --> 01:12:14,788
A dermatologist?

1050
01:12:20,419 --> 01:12:21,670
I was really good.

1051
01:12:23,922 --> 01:12:25,007
Nice.

1052
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:27,676
-We did well.
-We're done.

1053
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,762
It was me who came up with the idea.

1054
01:12:31,472 --> 01:12:33,474
YOU'RE COMING TOMORROW, RIGHT?

1055
01:12:33,557 --> 01:12:35,225
SURE. LET'S GO SOMEWHERE NICE

1056
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:41,523
I'm going. Seriously.

1057
01:12:48,072 --> 01:12:48,947
Hey.

1058
01:12:50,741 --> 01:12:52,409
It was impossible to find parking.

1059
01:12:52,493 --> 01:12:53,535
What do you think?

1060
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:54,787
They're pretty.

1061
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:56,288
Which one looks better on me?

1062
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:57,206
This one.

1063
01:12:57,289 --> 01:12:58,791
This one? Isn't this prettier?

1064
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:00,167
Just get that.

1065
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:03,337
Why are there so many people?

1066
01:13:04,171 --> 01:13:05,381
Damn it.

1067
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:08,592
I'm hungry.

1068
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:11,970
Let's go.

1069
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:13,555
-You're not getting it?
-No.

1070
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:17,935
I'm so tired.

1071
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:21,897
There's so much work
that I didn't even get to finish it.

1072
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:23,482
Try some of our macarons.

1073
01:13:24,483 --> 01:13:25,609
You can just try them.

1074
01:13:25,692 --> 01:13:27,361
That one is strawberry.

1075
01:13:29,321 --> 01:13:30,447
I don't want it.

1076
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:32,616
I don't like sweets.

1077
01:13:34,952 --> 01:13:37,329
This is green tea, and this is blueberry.

1078
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:39,540
We made them today. They're really good.

1079
01:13:43,877 --> 01:13:45,796
I'll come back another time.

1080
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:51,135
Let's go if you got what you needed.
I'm tired.

1081
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:55,222
I don't need anything.

1082
01:13:55,305 --> 01:13:56,306
Let's go.

1083
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:12,823
Just buy them online.

1084
01:14:12,906 --> 01:14:14,533
There's a lot of good stuff online.

1085
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:18,078
Let's eat quickly and rest.

1086
01:14:18,162 --> 01:14:19,496
I'm exhausted.

1087
01:14:21,331 --> 01:14:23,375
Is it exhausting seeing me?

1088
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:27,754
Don't be like that.

1089
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:29,882
Why are you crying?

1090
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:32,259
Seeing you isn't exhausting.

1091
01:14:32,342 --> 01:14:34,636
I'm just really busy at work.

1092
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,555
You know…

1093
01:14:36,638 --> 01:14:40,267
I'm very busy at work too,
and I'm also exhausted.

1094
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:42,936
But I want to be with you,

1095
01:14:43,604 --> 01:14:46,190
and I want our time together
to be special.

1096
01:14:46,273 --> 01:14:48,942
And I came because I wanted us
to love each other more.

1097
01:14:49,026 --> 01:14:51,612
Do you think I came here to buy something?

1098
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,282
Okay. I'm sorry.

1099
01:14:55,824 --> 01:14:58,243
I'm sorry. I really am.

1100
01:14:59,036 --> 01:15:03,248
Let's go. I'll take you
to an amazing restaurant.

1101
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:04,958
-Chin up.
-What's wrong with you?

1102
01:15:05,042 --> 01:15:07,044
Why do you always want to eat?

1103
01:15:07,127 --> 01:15:09,880
Is it because you're hungry
or are you trying to kill time?

1104
01:15:09,963 --> 01:15:12,466
You don't want to do anything
with me anymore, do you?

1105
01:15:12,549 --> 01:15:14,635
How could you say that?

1106
01:15:14,718 --> 01:15:18,013
Don't be mad. I'm sorry. Okay?

1107
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:23,602
Don't cry, my pretty Bo-yeong. Okay?

1108
01:15:27,731 --> 01:15:29,816
You can't park here. Please move your car.

1109
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:31,485
Okay, I will.

1110
01:15:31,568 --> 01:15:32,861
Why are you crying?

1111
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:54,716
Should we put on some music?

1112
01:15:55,425 --> 01:15:59,054
<i>Ms. A, who brutally stabbed her boyfriend
to death for cheating on her,</i>

1113
01:15:59,137 --> 01:16:00,722
<i>was arrested by the police.</i>

1114
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:04,184
<i>The police announced that the man
cheated on her with his work colleague…</i>

1115
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:06,311
What should we eat?

1116
01:16:10,691 --> 01:16:11,692
Pull over.

1117
01:16:11,775 --> 01:16:12,776
What?

1118
01:16:12,859 --> 01:16:14,111
I said to pull over.

1119
01:16:14,194 --> 01:16:15,529
We can go there.

1120
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:21,159
<i>Would you like to order?</i>

1121
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:22,578
A couple set please.

1122
01:16:22,661 --> 01:16:24,121
What are you doing?

1123
01:16:24,204 --> 01:16:25,038
What?

1124
01:16:25,122 --> 01:16:27,541
Sorry. You get the most expensive one.

1125
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:29,626
A gold burger set too.

1126
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:31,086
<i>Please, drive through.</i>

1127
01:16:31,169 --> 01:16:32,796
Let's go.

1128
01:16:34,881 --> 01:16:37,342
-It's 27,000 won.
-Who is it?

1129
01:16:37,968 --> 01:16:38,802
Who?

1130
01:16:38,885 --> 01:16:40,137
She's a cashier.

1131
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:42,139
It'll be right out.

1132
01:16:42,222 --> 01:16:43,515
Thank you.

1133
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:45,183
Who's Bo-yeong?

1134
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:46,852
Who?

1135
01:16:50,022 --> 01:16:51,106
A colleague at work.

1136
01:16:51,189 --> 01:16:52,858
You're mad because of that mistake I made.

1137
01:16:53,984 --> 01:16:55,068
She's a colleague.

1138
01:16:55,152 --> 01:16:58,905
Do you call your colleague
"my pretty Bo-yeong"?

1139
01:17:00,198 --> 01:17:01,908
Are you suspecting me?

1140
01:17:02,784 --> 01:17:04,953
There's nothing going on with her.

1141
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:08,874
What's wrong?
Are you saying I cheated on you?

1142
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:11,209
I never said that.

1143
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:13,879
Your face says you suspect me.

1144
01:17:16,715 --> 01:17:19,426
Excuse me. Your food's ready.

1145
01:17:23,972 --> 01:17:26,224
You said her name so tenderly.

1146
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:28,185
What are you talking about? Be reasonable!

1147
01:17:28,268 --> 01:17:30,437
How is this unreasonable?

1148
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:32,314
You're the one being unreasonable.

1149
01:17:32,397 --> 01:17:34,733
Why do you keep suspecting me?

1150
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:37,110
Do you think I slept with her
or something?

1151
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:40,113
Why are you doing this to me?
I'm tired, but I came anyway.

1152
01:17:40,197 --> 01:17:42,074
Didn't you come because you missed me?

1153
01:17:42,157 --> 01:17:44,493
You don't come
because you miss me anymore.

1154
01:17:44,576 --> 01:17:46,203
I'm forcing you to come, aren't I?

1155
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:49,873
I came because I wanted to see you.

1156
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:52,626
I felt bad for you, so…

1157
01:17:55,212 --> 01:17:57,255
You feel bad for me?

1158
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:02,594
I…

1159
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:06,973
feel so bad for our baby
that you gave up on.

1160
01:18:10,894 --> 01:18:11,728
What?

1161
01:18:13,897 --> 01:18:14,731
Hey.

1162
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:18,610
Was that only my fault?

1163
01:18:35,502 --> 01:18:36,586
Fuck. Seriously.

1164
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:38,880
Fuck. Seriously.

1165
01:18:39,506 --> 01:18:41,758
How dare she suspect me?

1166
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:45,137
Did I do it with her? Did I? Shit.

1167
01:19:47,908 --> 01:19:49,201
Are things tough?

1168
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:54,498
If it's tough, it's love.

1169
01:19:55,373 --> 01:19:57,834
-Unbelievable.
-What are you talking about?

1170
01:19:57,918 --> 01:20:00,462
They went to eat without us again.

1171
01:20:00,545 --> 01:20:04,132
Don't have burgers. Have rice.

1172
01:20:05,759 --> 01:20:08,261
Hyeok! What should we have for lunch?

1173
01:20:08,345 --> 01:20:10,972
Let's eat something better
than what they're eating.

1174
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:22,776
You've been so focused lately.

1175
01:20:24,236 --> 01:20:25,695
Did something happen?

1176
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:53,974
-It's pretty.
-I know, right?

1177
01:20:54,057 --> 01:20:56,685
But it would look better in this color.

1178
01:21:04,484 --> 01:21:06,194
What time is it?

1179
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:08,154
Why are you up so early?

1180
01:21:09,489 --> 01:21:10,991
Go back to sleep.

1181
01:21:12,784 --> 01:21:14,786
-This place is really good.
-Yes.

1182
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:17,038
I feel warm inside.

1183
01:21:19,749 --> 01:21:20,917
What should we get?

1184
01:21:21,501 --> 01:21:23,295
-How about <i>galbitang</i>?
-Sounds good.

1185
01:21:24,337 --> 01:21:26,548
-What are you looking at?
-What?

1186
01:21:27,215 --> 01:21:28,967
Nothing. Let's eat.

1187
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:30,844
Let's eat.

1188
01:21:34,598 --> 01:21:37,684
Oh my gosh. He's so cute.

1189
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:40,437
Isn't he so cute?

1190
01:21:41,521 --> 01:21:43,732
Yes, he's cute.

1191
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:48,236
I want a baby soon.

1192
01:21:58,204 --> 01:21:59,039
Hello?

1193
01:21:59,122 --> 01:22:00,206
<i>You rarely call now.</i>

1194
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:04,419
Are you looking down on our mid-sized firm
because you're at a large corporation?

1195
01:22:04,502 --> 01:22:05,378
Stop that.

1196
01:22:05,462 --> 01:22:07,339
I'm working my ass off with all-nighters.

1197
01:22:07,422 --> 01:22:08,590
<i>Really?</i>

1198
01:22:08,673 --> 01:22:11,301
Anyway, your contract is almost over.

1199
01:22:11,384 --> 01:22:12,427
<i>Did they say anything?</i>

1200
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:15,221
I'm working hard,
but they haven't said anything.

1201
01:22:16,973 --> 01:22:21,728
<i>You should get established there
and take me with you.</i>

1202
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:23,438
<i>Okay?</i>

1203
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:26,107
<i>Hello? Hey.</i>

1204
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:27,567
A REMINDER THAT YOU HAVE RESERVED
TICKETS TO JEJU

1205
01:22:28,485 --> 01:22:32,989
<i>Hey. Hello? Are you there?</i>

1206
01:22:33,073 --> 01:22:34,240
Yes.

1207
01:22:35,283 --> 01:22:36,242
I didn't hear you.

1208
01:22:37,702 --> 01:22:41,331
Now that you're at a large corporation,
you're kicking me to the curb.

1209
01:22:41,414 --> 01:22:43,792
<i>Don't be like that. Karma will get you.</i>

1210
01:22:47,754 --> 01:22:50,298
How about braised kimchi
with Jeju black pork today?

1211
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:52,884
You always make the best choices.

1212
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:55,220
There's also a new
Jeju black pork noodle place.

1213
01:22:55,303 --> 01:22:58,765
-How does that sound?
-Nothing beats having it in Jeju.

1214
01:22:58,848 --> 01:23:01,101
Black pork braised kimchi. Let's go.

1215
01:23:01,184 --> 01:23:03,561
TICKET TO JEJU WASN'T CANCELED

1216
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:08,441
GO WITH SOMEONE ELSE IF YOU WANT

1217
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:11,444
{\an8}JUNG DA-EUN
HYEOK LOVE DA-EUN

1218
01:23:11,528 --> 01:23:13,822
{\an8}Why won't she change her profile picture?

1219
01:23:13,905 --> 01:23:15,365
She's making me feel bad.

1220
01:23:15,448 --> 01:23:19,703
Those permanent employee punks
went to eat by themselves again.

1221
01:23:21,454 --> 01:23:23,915
However, we can have burgers.

1222
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:26,334
I got you the gold burger set.

1223
01:23:26,918 --> 01:23:30,422
We should use Jeju basalt
for the flooring here.

1224
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:34,300
Right? It'll differentiate it
from the road because of the color.

1225
01:23:34,384 --> 01:23:36,761
Sure. That sounds good.

1226
01:23:37,762 --> 01:23:39,014
Jeju…

1227
01:23:49,816 --> 01:23:51,109
COME TO JEJU!

1228
01:23:51,192 --> 01:23:53,528
CONFIRMATION TEXT
FOR YOUR TRIP TO JEJU

1229
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:57,490
Why won't she cancel it?

1230
01:23:57,574 --> 01:23:59,034
What the hell?

1231
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:09,169
<i>This is the Seoul International
Compact City created by Samyoung.</i>

1232
01:24:09,252 --> 01:24:10,336
<i>Samyoung!</i>

1233
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:17,552
I love my job.

1234
01:24:17,635 --> 01:24:20,889
Because as long as this city isn't
eliminated by a natural disaster,

1235
01:24:20,972 --> 01:24:23,475
Samyoung's name and achievements

1236
01:24:23,558 --> 01:24:25,894
will never disappear.

1237
01:24:25,977 --> 01:24:27,645
I'd like to thank

1238
01:24:28,354 --> 01:24:31,733
City Project Team Three
for making this happen.

1239
01:24:31,816 --> 01:24:33,568
City Project Team!

1240
01:24:33,651 --> 01:24:35,445
-Go team!
-Go team!

1241
01:24:37,947 --> 01:24:39,407
-Thank you!
-We did all the work.

1242
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:40,867
We got no acknowledgement.

1243
01:24:51,961 --> 01:24:53,671
Great job, both of you.

1244
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:55,715
I hope we get to work together again.

1245
01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:00,053
Thanks.

1246
01:25:00,136 --> 01:25:03,306
We have a year-end party later,
so make sure to attend. Okay?

1247
01:25:03,389 --> 01:25:04,766
-You too, Bo-yeong.
-Yes, sir.

1248
01:25:04,849 --> 01:25:07,018
You were great. You'll get another chance.

1249
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:09,395
-Come visit sometime.
-You're both so talented.

1250
01:25:09,479 --> 01:25:10,438
Good luck.

1251
01:25:10,522 --> 01:25:11,481
You're beautiful.

1252
01:25:21,908 --> 01:25:26,246
<i>If you feel</i>

1253
01:25:26,329 --> 01:25:30,500
<i>Like you're lonely</i>

1254
01:25:30,583 --> 01:25:34,879
<i>Leave to Jeju</i>

1255
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:40,510
<i>For the clear night skies of Jeju</i>

1256
01:25:42,137 --> 01:25:44,931
Why did they invite us to watch
the permanent employees party?

1257
01:25:51,104 --> 01:25:53,231
You have to go back
to your company, right?

1258
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:58,153
You said it was in Incheon, right?
Are you a permanent employee there?

1259
01:25:58,236 --> 01:25:59,571
Yes.

1260
01:26:02,282 --> 01:26:03,575
Then…

1261
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:06,077
Are you leaving right away?

1262
01:26:06,619 --> 01:26:09,914
You have a place in Seoul.
Can't you commute?

1263
01:26:09,998 --> 01:26:12,584
You have your cute little car.

1264
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:16,713
Sure.

1265
01:26:17,297 --> 01:26:18,548
I should.

1266
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:22,135
What will you do?

1267
01:26:29,309 --> 01:26:30,894
I'm going to go study abroad.

1268
01:26:33,354 --> 01:26:35,773
Even if I go back,
I'm a contract worker there too.

1269
01:26:35,857 --> 01:26:39,777
I want to beef up my resume
and get a permanent position somewhere.

1270
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:57,670
I'm going to the bathroom.

1271
01:27:00,798 --> 01:27:02,217
You were great!

1272
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:04,469
Planning Team One!

1273
01:27:04,552 --> 01:27:05,845
-Yes!
-You're the best!

1274
01:27:05,929 --> 01:27:08,389
The mood is too down today.

1275
01:27:08,473 --> 01:27:10,558
The person who parties the hardest

1276
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:12,936
gets a five-day trip to Jeju.

1277
01:27:13,019 --> 01:27:15,563
Leave immediately with your loved one!

1278
01:27:15,647 --> 01:27:17,190
It's a perfect holiday!

1279
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:20,985
Thank you, sir!

1280
01:27:23,738 --> 01:27:25,990
What are you afraid of?

1281
01:27:26,824 --> 01:27:28,743
Let's do this!

1282
01:27:34,374 --> 01:27:36,960
JUNG DA-EUN

1283
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:00,692
Mr. Jang.

1284
01:28:03,945 --> 01:28:06,155
If you miss a cab,
you can wait for the next one.

1285
01:28:07,865 --> 01:28:09,284
But if you lose a person…

1286
01:28:10,868 --> 01:28:12,078
that's it.

1287
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:18,418
I'll miss you…

1288
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:22,797
a lot.

1289
01:29:00,293 --> 01:29:01,419
Da-eun…

1290
01:29:02,128 --> 01:29:05,298
Sir. I'll get off now. Hurry.

1291
01:29:46,214 --> 01:29:47,965
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

1292
01:29:48,633 --> 01:29:49,842
I'm sorry…

1293
01:30:07,693 --> 01:30:10,196
{\an8}3 MONTHS AGO

1294
01:30:10,279 --> 01:30:12,698
{\an8}NAME: LEE JANG-HYEOK
GENDER: M

1295
01:30:12,782 --> 01:30:14,242
Mr. Lee Jang-hyeok.

1296
01:30:14,325 --> 01:30:15,243
Give me the chart.

1297
01:30:15,326 --> 01:30:16,619
Here.

1298
01:30:19,956 --> 01:30:22,959
TWO PAIRS OF SNEAKERS

1299
01:30:25,503 --> 01:30:27,880
{\an8}1 YEAR 7 MONTHS AGO

1300
01:30:27,964 --> 01:30:29,340
{\an8}NAME: JANG HYEOK
GENDER: M

1301
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:38,266
{\an8}GET BETTER QUICKLY

1302
01:30:45,189 --> 01:30:46,190
Hyeok.

1303
01:30:47,108 --> 01:30:48,109
What's this?

1304
01:30:49,861 --> 01:30:51,320
Are they matching sneakers?

1305
01:30:51,904 --> 01:30:53,322
This is so nice.

1306
01:30:53,406 --> 01:30:56,492
Let's come to Jeju every Christmas, Hyeok.

1307
01:30:56,576 --> 01:30:59,912
They're finally appreciating
what I can do.

1308
01:31:01,956 --> 01:31:03,583
It's so pretty.

1309
01:31:03,666 --> 01:31:05,084
It's a woman?

1310
01:31:05,168 --> 01:31:07,837
We got this patient today…

1311
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:10,715
I'll give you a special prescription
for a quick recovery.

1312
01:31:12,592 --> 01:31:13,801
It's so annoying.

1313
01:31:13,885 --> 01:31:15,720
I'm working tonight again.

1314
01:31:16,596 --> 01:31:17,972
It's my graduation ring.

1315
01:31:19,724 --> 01:31:20,558
I see.

1316
01:31:24,353 --> 01:31:26,355
IS IT JUST YOU TWO AGAIN TONIGHT?

1317
01:31:26,439 --> 01:31:28,816
IT'S SUPER SLOW
SINCE IT'S JUST TWO OF US WORKING

1318
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,985
You sound like you're outside. It's noisy.

1319
01:31:31,068 --> 01:31:34,655
You don't mind if I call you "Hyeok,"
do you?

1320
01:31:34,739 --> 01:31:37,575
I'm tired because there was
so much freaking traffic coming here.

1321
01:31:37,658 --> 01:31:39,452
I haven't gotten my period.

1322
01:31:39,535 --> 01:31:41,704
It's been four weeks.

1323
01:31:41,787 --> 01:31:44,957
Since it's the first trimester,
you may have bad morning sickness.

1324
01:31:45,041 --> 01:31:48,628
<i>You may suddenly get very hungry
and feel like having this and that.</i>

1325
01:31:48,711 --> 01:31:50,713
There's no freaking way
I have a girlfriend.

1326
01:31:50,796 --> 01:31:53,299
I can't stand people who talk like that.

1327
01:31:53,382 --> 01:31:54,967
<i>Even if you're sleepy and tired,</i>

1328
01:31:55,051 --> 01:31:58,012
<i>you can't have coffee, alcohol, or smoke.</i>

1329
01:31:58,095 --> 01:31:59,222
Jaundice!

1330
01:32:01,265 --> 01:32:04,852
You may get very sleepy.

1331
01:32:04,936 --> 01:32:10,441
<i>The baby is saying, "Mommy, I'm sleepy."
It's how they communicate.</i>

1332
01:32:10,524 --> 01:32:13,903
So you should sleep, okay?

1333
01:32:29,001 --> 01:32:30,336
YOU MUST BE SLEEPING. OKAY. REST

1334
01:32:30,419 --> 01:32:31,712
Hyeok?

1335
01:32:31,796 --> 01:32:33,714
I like you very, very much.

1336
01:32:35,216 --> 01:32:36,634
Do you want to come over?

1337
01:32:39,637 --> 01:32:41,180
Sleep over.

1338
01:32:43,599 --> 01:32:44,433
<i>Da-eun.</i>

1339
01:32:45,142 --> 01:32:46,060
Are you up?

1340
01:32:46,143 --> 01:32:49,480
Thank you for changing the light bulb.

1341
01:32:49,563 --> 01:32:51,399
<i>Why didn't you wake me before you left?</i>

1342
01:32:51,482 --> 01:32:53,192
I left in the middle of the night.

1343
01:32:53,276 --> 01:32:55,611
You were sound asleep, so I felt bad--

1344
01:33:01,075 --> 01:33:02,827
I JUST FINISHED
I CAN'T GO. I HAVE TO WORK

1345
01:33:06,622 --> 01:33:08,958
Hyeok. Where are you?

1346
01:33:09,041 --> 01:33:10,751
I just got off work.

1347
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:13,337
You can hug me.

1348
01:33:15,506 --> 01:33:17,883
Don't cry, my pretty Bo-yeong.

1349
01:33:19,927 --> 01:33:21,846
You feel bad for me?

1350
01:33:22,722 --> 01:33:24,724
Da-eun, where's your ring?

1351
01:33:24,807 --> 01:33:26,225
I lost it.

1352
01:33:29,103 --> 01:33:31,939
Someone I know says they'll give me
their vacation package to Jeju.

1353
01:33:32,023 --> 01:33:33,024
Want to go with me?

1354
01:33:33,107 --> 01:33:35,109
It's Lee Jang-hyeok, not Jang Hyeok.

1355
01:33:35,901 --> 01:33:37,695
Yes. I must have made a typo.

1356
01:33:37,778 --> 01:33:39,238
Please change it.

1357
01:33:41,615 --> 01:33:43,659
I'll take this.

1358
01:33:56,547 --> 01:33:59,508
Are you okay, Hyeok? Can you get up?

1359
01:34:02,136 --> 01:34:03,512
Does it hurt a lot?

1360
01:34:04,055 --> 01:34:06,015
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

1361
01:34:06,098 --> 01:34:08,684
Oh no. You should've been more careful.

1362
01:34:08,768 --> 01:34:09,852
Can you stand up?

1363
01:34:09,935 --> 01:34:10,936
Yes.

1364
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:12,313
Right. Take my hand.

1365
01:34:12,396 --> 01:34:13,939
-Gosh.
-Oh, no.

1366
01:34:14,565 --> 01:34:16,192
-Let's go.
-Sorry.

1367
01:34:16,275 --> 01:34:19,403
Oh no. What will I do with you?

1368
01:34:20,029 --> 01:34:21,739
Aren't you hungry?

1369
01:34:21,822 --> 01:34:23,616
No, I'm fine.

1370
01:34:23,699 --> 01:34:25,576
Let's go have a delicious meal.

1371
01:34:26,577 --> 01:34:27,495
Hurry.

1372
01:34:50,101 --> 01:34:51,560
Damn it.

1373
01:34:56,273 --> 01:34:57,817
That bitch.

1374
01:35:00,111 --> 01:35:01,153
Damn it.

1375
01:35:22,675 --> 01:35:25,761
It's almost time to board. Let's go.

1376
01:35:27,221 --> 01:35:28,681
Hyeok.

1377
01:35:29,598 --> 01:35:31,392
This is heavy.

1378
01:35:31,475 --> 01:35:33,811
Da-eun. I'm sorry.

1379
01:35:33,894 --> 01:35:35,479
Let's hurry, Da-eun.

1380
01:35:52,663 --> 01:35:55,291
What the hell? Where did you go?

1381
01:35:55,374 --> 01:35:58,002
You left me all alone
with those permanent employee punks!

1382
01:36:00,171 --> 01:36:01,464
However…

1383
01:36:03,132 --> 01:36:04,884
I won the trip to Jeju!

1384
01:36:05,426 --> 01:36:06,260
Wait.

1385
01:36:06,343 --> 01:36:08,012
FREE 5 DAY TRIP TO JEJU

1386
01:36:15,936 --> 01:36:17,271
<i>Where did it all go wrong?</i>

1387
01:36:17,354 --> 01:36:19,440
I'm tired. I'll do it later.

1388
01:36:19,523 --> 01:36:20,441
<i>Was it here?</i>

1389
01:36:20,524 --> 01:36:22,359
Don't cry, my pretty Bo-yeong.

1390
01:36:22,443 --> 01:36:23,694
<i>Here?</i>

1391
01:36:23,777 --> 01:36:25,321
A couple set please.

1392
01:36:25,404 --> 01:36:26,947
<i>I should've gotten her something better.</i>

1393
01:36:28,324 --> 01:36:29,533
<i>Should I have stayed then?</i>

1394
01:36:29,617 --> 01:36:31,994
<i>I bought a new light bulb.
Can you change it?</i>

1395
01:36:32,912 --> 01:36:34,163
<i>Is it because of the light bulb?</i>

1396
01:36:34,246 --> 01:36:37,208
I pushed hard for you.

1397
01:36:37,291 --> 01:36:38,125
<i>That's not it.</i>

1398
01:36:38,209 --> 01:36:40,628
<i>This is all the chief's fault. Damn it.</i>

1399
01:36:43,172 --> 01:36:45,299
We'll ride an electric car.

1400
01:36:45,382 --> 01:36:46,467
And this hotel…

1401
01:36:47,468 --> 01:36:48,677
Bo-yeong.

1402
01:36:49,929 --> 01:36:51,096
Please don't leave.

1403
01:36:53,849 --> 01:36:54,975
I love you.

1404
01:36:56,894 --> 01:36:58,771
Wait. What the hell?

1405
01:37:00,814 --> 01:37:03,692
Hey. What are you doing?
I'm not there yet.

1406
01:37:05,528 --> 01:37:07,112
-Right?
-Right.

1407
01:37:07,196 --> 01:37:08,405
Okay.

1408
01:37:20,251 --> 01:37:21,210
Damn it.

1409
