1
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,100
The lights get off.

2
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,700
The audience suddenly disappears.

3
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,100
And then...

4
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:58,700
CAUTION: DO NOT LOOK

5
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,700
Have you thought of a story yet?

6
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,000
Not yet.

7
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,700
Because?

8
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,100
We've alredy talk about that?

9
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,490
The idea is a story that takes place in a cinema,

10
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:15,610
no matter if he is a ghost or a bloodthirsty killer.

11
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,100
But you have to give me something soon!

12
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,100
Please give me a few weeks.

13
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:21,900
Yeah.

14
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,100
Sometimes I have good hunches.

15
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,490
When I look for a new director,

16
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,500
But with you I still don't know if I did the right thing.

17
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,240
You have two weeks.

18
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,900
It's your last chance.

19
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,820
If the boss has nothing at the end of the month,

20
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,900
He'll fire us both.

21
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,900
You're supposed to be a movie prodigy,

22
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,070
but the expenses accumulate and you do not present anything.

23
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,900
I do not know what to think.

24
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,000
Ok, are you sure you can do it?

25
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,500
- Yes. - I can count on you.

26
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,300
Yeah.

27
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,780
That story is not good.

28
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,700
Yeah?

29
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,800
Do you have anything else for me?

30
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,200
I have something, but I'm not sure.

31
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,100
Go ahead, enlighten me.

32
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,100
A friend of mine heard about it from a guy in the neighborhood.

33
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,690
His brother was going to film school in Korea.

34
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,780
During the screening of one of the end-of-year projects,

35
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,440
half of the spectators left the cinema

36
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:36,700
and one died of a heart attack.

37
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,700
Who was the guy?

38
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,500
Don't know.

39
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,320
They investigated the responsible student,

40
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:51,300
he said the whole movie was ghosted.

41
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,100
A ghost made the movie?

42
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,100
That's how it is.

43
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,300
How is the movie called?

44
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,800
He did not tell me.

45
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,100
How long has been?

46
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,400
Don't know.

47
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,300
Can you contact him?

48
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,050
It's just... I didn't see him anymore.

49
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:17,800
In fact, I heard that he got into the Daejeon Film School.

50
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,400
The Daejeon Film School.

51
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,150
Who are you?

52
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,990
Good morning.

53
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,700
You. is it Mrs. Jo Mi-kyung?

54
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,700
So that famous short film was yours?

55
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,500
Tell me. What brings you here?

56
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,930
A few years ago

57
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,130
had a student

58
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,990
you did a horror movie as your final project?

59
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,430
Many of them make horror movies.

60
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:45,500
He said that the film was made by a ghost.

61
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,300
Do you know what the movie is called?

62
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,500
To tell the truth, I don't know.

63
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,700
Do you know what year it was made?

64
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,300
I don't know that either.

65
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,490
Did you just come here because of a rumor of a movie made by a ghost?

66
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,700
Do you really believe that?

67
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,900
You really don't know her?

68
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,860
I have been a teacher here for 10 years

69
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,700
and never heard of it.

70
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,300
Maybe it was more than 10 years ago?

71
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,780
This department was also created 10 years ago.

72
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,100
I'm afraid you went to all this trouble for nothing.

73
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:37,700
If the boss has nothing at the end of the month

74
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,700
they will fire us both.

75
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,200
It's your last chance!

76
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,490
The more I watch Nolan movies, the more I hallucinate.

77
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,500
Who cares about Nolan?

78
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,400
Then you don't know his works.

79
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,400
If you liked Nolan, your movies would be better.

80
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,600
Don't start with that...

81
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,900
I'm sick of introspection!

82
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,300
You don't like El Sicario and Contact.

83
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,900
Yes. Yes. Do me a favor,

84
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,100
tell him about Nolan.

85
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,900
You lost $30,000 because you took Nam to court.

86
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,100
You can't fault Nolan.

87
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,320
Oh my God.

88
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,700
Excuse me.

89
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,900
You. Are you students of the Daejeon Film School?

90
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,150
Yes that's how it is.

91
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,610
Well, how about a little game?

92
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,200
Like what?

93
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,940
They tell me a horror story.

94
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,100
If it doesn't scare me, you guys have a drink?

95
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,070
And if we scare you?

96
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,030
If they manage to scare me.

97
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,360
I'll grant you one wish.

98
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,570
- A desire? - Wait.

99
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,440
What we want?

100
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,500
10 extra points, if it is a true fact.

101
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,600
20 if it happened in college.

102
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,150
University...

103
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,500
Do you mean here?

104
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,110
I first.

105
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:53,900
Good. Sung-Tae, you first.

106
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,500
I heard this from an advanced student.

107
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,100
There is an abandoned cinema near the campus.

108
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,700
There an actress named Soon-Mi

109
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,900
burned alive while filming a

110
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,800
movie and his ghost haunts there.

111
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,320
- That's all. - Baby!

112
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,440
- Drink drink drink. - Go Go! Baby.

113
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:16,070
- Come on! - Drink, drink, drink, drink!

114
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,900
Good. Who's next?

115
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,900
I i i!

116
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,150
Good Jung Min.

117
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,700
This happened 10 years ago.

118
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,780
A student made a horror movie for his final project.

119
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,190
You know, the projections to pass the course?

120
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,200
I heard that movie

121
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,500
it's super scary.

122
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,700
Some fainted, one had a heart attack.

123
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,690
Is it so scary?

124
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,300
Do you know what the director said?

125
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,650
That he had not made the film,

126
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,800
that it had been a ghost!

127
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,490
A ghost? But how...?

128
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,240
They filmed in the abandoned cinema,

129
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,360
While the team waited

130
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,070
suddenly the ghost appeared

131
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:57,600
he broke their arms and tried to kill them by hanging them.

132
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,600
- Simple as that. - Stop!

133
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,100
He... doesn't know, I mean...

134
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,190
- I'll tell you about Soon-Mi! -Sung Tae,

135
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,690
don't interrupt Jung-min.

136
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,700
That's how it is!

137
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,800
But I know the story well.

138
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,860
The ghost asked the director what kind of movie he wanted to make.

139
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,150
"He told him he wanted to make the scariest movie ever."

140
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,900
And then the ghost knocked him out.

141
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,860
It's my turn, idiot!

142
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,440
Let go! I bit my tongue!

143
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:27,300
Don't fight in front of her, idiots!

144
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,300
My damn tongue!

145
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,200
You deserve it.

146
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,900
Why don't you bite this.

147
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:37,700
Mi-jung, listen to this is very important.

148
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:42,110
I mean... that movie was called Beware

149
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:46,100
and was accepted into a festival.

150
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,500
Really?

151
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,300
Yes, at the Bucheon Film Festival.

152
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:00,600
The movie is called Beware

153
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,700
a ghost made her.

154
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,700
It was shown at the Bucheon Film Festival.

155
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,900
Mi-jung! Park Mi Jung!

156
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,500
Open the door?

157
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,700
Park Mi-jung, open the door!

158
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,700
Mi-jung! Mi-jung!

159
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,500
Park Mi Jung!

160
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,700
It's been a while.

161
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,490
What brings you here?

162
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,660
Sorry to come so soon, Mr.

163
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,660
No problem. What's happening?

164
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,290
I'm looking for a movie that was shown here.

165
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:51,300
I would be interested in seeing it.

166
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,750
Yeah? Come on, come with me.

167
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:00,600
It's called Beware, it was 10 years ago.

168
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,600
That's how it is.

169
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,330
How did you find out about her?

170
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,900
I'll tell you later.

171
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,700
I found her! Look!

172
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,400
It was selected, but someone deleted it.

173
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,300
Is there any record?

174
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,830
I think so. We should open it.

175
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:24,900
Yes, open it!

176
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:29,500
Those records are no longer here.

177
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,500
But don't worry, I'll ask a colleague.

178
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,700
Wait here.

179
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,700
I'll take care.

180
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,800
Yes sir. Kim?

181
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,100
A friend of mine

182
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,900
you need to watch a movie from the archives.

183
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,500
Could you find it for her?

184
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,900
Yes. It's called Beware.

185
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,600
It appears as "Deleted".

186
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,100
Yeah?

187
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,900
You. you have the film, care?

188
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,900
What what friend?

189
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,500
Yes. I don't know how you found out about the movie.

190
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,300
No, I do not know.

191
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,000
Sorry to bother.

192
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,100
Thank you so much.

193
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,500
Excuse me. excuse me.

194
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,300
Sorry for the wait.

195
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,400
Where did he go?

196
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,300
The trailer?

197
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:57,950
It's not the whole movie.

198
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,400
Who are you? Who are you?

199
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,160
"Contact information."

200
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,490
The dialed number is not available.

201
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,600
"El E-mail."

202
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,100
Two American coffees to go.

203
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,900
- Thank you, take care. - Thank you.

204
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,250
Mi-jung!

205
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,460
That?

206
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,500
Mi-jung, you've been updating all afternoon.

207
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,760
Yes that's how it is?

208
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,500
Hello?

209
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:53,500
Delete your post.

210
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,100
Who the hell are you?

211
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,300
Delete the post about Beware now.

212
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:07,290
Who are you to ask me to do that?

213
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:09,100
I'm Kim Jae-hyun,

214
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,000
the director of care

215
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,400
Sr. Kim,

216
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,080
Your movie intrigues me a lot.

217
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,000
Delete it, did you hear me?

218
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,500
Where can we meet?

219
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,500
I will delete it only after seeing it.

220
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,100
Shit.

221
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,700
Mi-jung, who was it?

222
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,100
I will call you later.

223
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,000
Mi-jung!

224
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,300
Park Mi Jung?

225
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,100
Are you the director Kim Jae-Hyun?

226
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,100
Good. Now delete the post.

227
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,100
- I... - Delete it right now!

228
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,900
Who told you about my movie?

229
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:41,990
About it just deleted. I want to ask you some questions.

230
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Do you believe in something?

231
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,100
I hear myself?

232
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,100
Forget Care.

233
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,800
and start going to church.

234
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,900
If you go now,

235
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,200
I will post it again.

236
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,900
You are Park Mi Jung. You were born in 1988, in the Sangdo district.

237
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,200
Listen, take my advice!

238
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,500
Don't come crying when it's too late.

239
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,100
Soon-Mi at the movies can't happen again.

240
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,100
I should have burned everything.

241
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,300
Go away.

242
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,300
Get out of here.

243
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,900
What do you want of me?

244
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,300
Tell me! Tell me!

245
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,300
I'm going crazy!

246
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,000
Again you?

247
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Who the hell are you?

248
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,500
Excuse me.

249
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,700
I was just curious.

250
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,750
That?

251
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,300
Do not even dream about it.

252
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,300
Where did you get this from?

253
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,500
I understand now. You're trying to make a movie out of this.

254
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,100
Soon-Mi is in that theater.

255
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,400
No, the same thing can't happen again.

256
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,900
- It won't happen, it won't happen, it won't happen. - Stop.

257
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,500
No. Stop.

258
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:09,500
Do you know what is worse than death?

259
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,700
Live in fear.

260
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,400
That is the scariest movie of all.

261
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,300
If you don't want to live the same as me!

262
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,100
I can help you right now!

263
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,500
Damn bastard.

264
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,300
He's totally crazy.

265
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,600
No no no.

266
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,850
Mi Jung, what's up?

267
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,700
Actually, I think they formatted it.

268
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,900
What are you saying?

269
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:43,400
No. I risked my life for this.

270
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,900
- Mi-jung... - Try it.

271
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,100
Try it.

272
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,450
No no.

273
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,900
Mi-jung!

274
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,300
What are you looking at?

275
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,300
Were you able to recover anything from the disk?

276
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,500
Did you like my movie?

277
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,100
I scare you?

278
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,300
Mi-jung!

279
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,700
What's the matter?

280
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,300
What is the status of the hard drive?

281
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,700
Use a recovery program.

282
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,600
Retrieve a file.

283
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,300
Really? show me.

284
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,700
Who are you?

285
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,100
Cut! Finished!

286
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,100
- Thank you. - Good job!

287
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,100
It was great.

288
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,100
We will call you in two days!

289
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,100
Good. Thank you so much!

290
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,100
- Goodbye see you later.

291
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,100
Bye bye.

292
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,900
- What do they say? - She was fine.

293
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,590
His appearance is perfect for a horror movie.

294
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:59,100
I don't like the way he frowned.

295
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,100
But something is missing, I don't know...

296
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,600
What do you think?

297
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,640
Actually, what worries me the most,

298
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,500
is to audition without a script.

299
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,500
Jae-Hyun, when will you finish the script?

300
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,970
Soon, I don't have much.

301
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:25,600
This is like behind the scenes.

302
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,700
Why do you want to make movies?

303
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:40,100
I? To make horror movies.

304
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,300
Why horror?

305
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,100
Once a horror movie saved my life.

306
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,900
A horror movie saved you.

307
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,100
Do you want to know how he saved my life?

308
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,100
I didn't have a good time in high school.

309
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,100
They harassed me all the time.

310
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,500
They beat me every day

311
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,700
and I really wanted to die.

312
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,680
they beat me so much

313
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,700
he spent more time in the hospital than in school.

314
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,390
One day they showed The Exorcist on TV.

315
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:21,400
"The scariest movie in movie history."

316
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,700
I couldn't stop looking at the screen.

317
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:30,100
My hands were shaking and I was crying.

318
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,900
It was like my heart started beating again.

319
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,900
It was terrifying, but suddenly, my pain was gone.

320
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,100
It was then that I made the decision.

321
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,800
My goal would be to make a horror movie

322
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:53,760
that would allow others to forget their suffering.

323
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,100
A power outage.

324
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,300
Brilliant!

325
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,200
Do you remember how we met?

326
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,500
You hired me as an assistant director on your first short.

327
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,750
That was 10 years ago.

328
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,100
That's how it is.

329
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,200
Thank you.

330
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,150
Thank you for continuing to be friends with a big egoist like me.

331
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,200
Stop now.

332
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:12,300
When I see you, I get jealous.

333
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:17,200
I think you're great.

334
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:21,500
You live every day for your dream.

335
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:31,100
My dream. I'm just a weirdo.

336
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:32,700
By the way...

337
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:38,100
I... read your script.

338
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,900
Excuse me.

339
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:50,080
- What do you think about it? - What thing?

340
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,100
What did you think of my script?

341
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:58,300
It's okay, but I noticed...

342
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:01,900
that the protagonist is exactly like you.

343
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,200
And her boyfriend is like you.

344
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,100
Do I have such a big mouth?

345
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:22,500
It's a fictional script, you know?

346
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:24,500
I know.

347
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,100
But...

348
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:32,000
what about the director

349
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,400
and her boyfriend at the end?

350
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:38,500
What do you mean "in the end"?

351
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,500
It's a horror movie, so it can't end well.

352
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,100
Good.

353
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,900
It must be great to be here at night.

354
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,900
Come on, it's not far.

355
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,800
It's perfect, it's how I imagined it would be.

356
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:11,830
Yeah. It's great. It's perfect, it's how I imagined it would be.

357
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:12,700
Yeah. It's great.

358
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:19,300
It's great.

359
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:34,800
Look. Does it look like a mockumentary like Blair Witch?

360
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,500
Good. This is the plot:

361
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:40,900
Some university students invite a friend to an abandoned cinema.

362
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,870
They want to drive him crazy, but then

363
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:44,700
a real ghost appears.

364
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,300
That is the history?

365
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,100
How about that?

366
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,240
Well, tell us the rest.

367
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:52,500
I'll read it well and tell you later.

368
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:55,000
It's crazy.

369
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:04,400
- Boo! - Shit!

370
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:07,300
- Shit. - I'm sorry.

371
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:17,100
Shit.

372
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,500
What happened?

373
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,500
What was that?

374
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:38,100
Soon-Mi, the actress.

375
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,400
This place is great!

376
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,200
It really is amazing.

377
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:01,700
Where are you going?

378
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:02,730
I'll check a little.

379
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
It's great.

380
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:37,500
Who are you?

381
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,500
I want to make the scariest movie ever.

382
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:46,870
Who is he talking to?

383
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:48,500
The "scariest" movie...

384
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,900
- Heavens. - Excuse me, Mr.

385
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:16,100
Alright. Do not apologize. I'm fine.

386
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,620
Aren't there rumors that this place is cursed?

387
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:22,990
Yes. That's what I heard.

388
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:25,740
It's the ghost of an actress who burned herself alive.

389
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:27,500
I think her name was Soon-Mi.

390
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
¿Soon-Mi?

391
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:33,500
The dust worries me more than that ghost.

392
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,160
¡Jae-Hyun!

393
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,500
Where do you think you are going?

394
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:46,900
Excuse me, I have to do some things.

395
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:49,500
I have to go.

396
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,900
- Jae Hyun! - Where are you going?

397
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:53,100
¡Jae-Hyun!

398
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:06,900
Who are you?

399
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:41,300
Soon-Mi. Soon-Mi.

400
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:44,700
It's the ghost of an actress who burned herself alive. Her name was Soon-Mi.

401
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,500
Soon-Mi is in that theater.

402
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:49,700
I mean, I'll tell you about Soon-Mi!

403
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,900
Mi-Jung, I'm here!

404
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:54,900
CAREFUL

405
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:16,240
Actually, this behind the scenes is the movie?

406
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:18,900
- Come see this. - What's that?

407
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:24,040
This is what I use in my photography work.

408
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,910
We could use it as something extra.

409
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:29,100
They pull and then...

410
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:33,500
So, it lights up.

411
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,600
Look. This is how you do it.

412
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:35,900
Cute, right?

413
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:40,900
I think it's very smoky.

414
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,400
They do not like it?

415
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:47,500
When the director arrives, we will ask him if we can use it.

416
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:52,500
Just in case, take one each.

417
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Good.

418
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:55,700
No, thanks.

419
00:53:55,790 --> 00:53:57,800
Take it now It's very dark in here!

420
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
¡Jae-Hyun!

421
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:10,080
Is everything ready?

422
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:13,300
Yes, but when does the actress arrive?

423
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:18,300
Be patient, it will come soon.

424
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,500
- Jae-Hyun,... - Wait.

425
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:24,300
I have to do some exterior shots, I don't have enough.

426
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:27,900
- What are you talking about? - What's the matter?

427
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:29,500
Where is he going now?

428
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,700
Are you okay, sir?

429
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,100
Give me some water.

430
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,700
Ji-Soo, is your phone working?

431
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,300
My battery is dead.

432
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,200
I'm going out for a while, okay?

433
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,500
Hey, what's up?

434
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:08,700
It turned itself off.

435
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,100
What, again?

436
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:16,400
Did you check that thing?

437
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,300
Ji Soo, are you alright?

438
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:18,500
Yes I'm fine.

439
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,700
- Ji Soo, don't move. - Nobody move.

440
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:21,700
Young-Min, give me the flashlight.

441
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:22,700
- Where is? - Take it easy.

442
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:23,700
Where is she?

443
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,400
I'm here.

444
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,700
You have to check the lights first.

445
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:29,100
Ji-Soo, don't move!

446
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:33,300
Be careful.

447
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:46,700
¡Young-Min!

448
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:57,300
¡Young-Min, Jo Young-Min!

449
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:12,980
Kwang-Bae... that's... that's...

450
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:14,900
Is it blood?

451
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,700
Jae-hyun, are you there?

452
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:22,800
¡Jae-Hyun!

453
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,500
Young-Min. Young-Min.

454
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,700
Please help.

455
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:39,900
Please help. Help me.

456
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:51,800
Who is it?

457
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:01,500
Who are you?

458
01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:07,100
You can see me?

459
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:17,900
Who are you?

460
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:27,900
Don't come any closer.

461
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:58,700
What are you doing here?

462
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:03,500
Well I, I...

463
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:06,100
That thing...

464
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,900
Did you think you could fool me with that body?

465
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:16,450
You are Soon-Mi.

466
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,500
What are you talking about?

467
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,900
I can't live like this anymore.

468
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:51,000
I have to end this.

469
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,300
Please, Mr. Kim...

470
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:56,900
I'm not Soon-Mi.

471
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:58,800
I'm a human being!

472
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:04,000
I know these weapons can't kill you.

473
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:12,500
I didn't mean to steal your hard drive.

474
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:13,700
I'm sorry.

475
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,700
I know everything about the movie.

476
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:19,700
This is all her fault!

477
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:24,300
She killed her entire team and made the movie make it to the theater.

478
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:25,700
She did all this!

479
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:38,100
I know none of this was your fault.

480
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,400
Just stop.

481
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:47,500
Let's get out of here.

482
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:51,300
I'll explain it to everyone else.

483
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:54,300
I will tell them that you are innocent!

484
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:55,500
Damn bastard!

485
01:04:57,700 --> 01:04:59,100
I'm innocent?

486
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:14,300
You...

487
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:19,700
You think you know everything. You think you know everything.

488
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:35,100
I went back to the cinema.

489
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:40,600
And I took the tapes of their deaths.

490
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:46,800
Then I edited them for the movie.

491
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:56,800
And then I had it shown in the cinema.

492
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,400
What the hell?

493
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:20,000
You...

494
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:22,900
you are completely crazy.

495
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:27,300
You...

496
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:32,700
You turned my life into a horror movie.

497
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:01,900
it's time that

498
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:04,700
Let's finish this movie.

499
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:44,600
Shit.

500
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:29,800
You are crazy too.

501
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:05,800
Come on! Come on!

502
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:11,200
Come on! Come on! Come on!

503
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:18,600
Hello?

504
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:21,500
Finally! Hello Principal Park!

505
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:23,500
Why is it so hard to find you?

506
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:25,700
I knew I could count with you.

507
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:28,200
You've been busy writing your script, haven't you?

508
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:29,200
Yes that's how it is.

509
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:30,500
Did you check my messages?

510
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:31,300
When will you be free?

511
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:44,300
You did a great job, it's great.

512
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:47,000
Are you free tomorrow to stop by the office?

513
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,590
We will write your contract and so you can sign it.

514
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:51,500
My contract?

515
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:52,300
Yeah!

516
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:54,300
Do you have any problem?

517
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:01,200
Yes, I will be there.

518
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:19,100
You are crazy too.

519
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:58,100
Director, I just got a call from investors.

520
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:01,100
They saw the first montage.

521
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:02,900
They love me.

522
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:08,500
Yeah. This place really gives me the creeps.

523
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:10,700
It does not need any decoration.

524
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:17,300
Only for curiosity,

525
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:18,800
how much of your movie

526
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,000
it is real?

527
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Who knows?

528
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:36,100
- Look here, Miss! - Smile please!

529
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:38,100
Director, please...

530
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,800
Let us take a picture of you.

531
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:42,100
Look over here!

532
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:12,100
The lights go out, the audience suddenly disappears.

533
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:13,100
And then...

534
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:35,500
Help me...

535
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:54,300
Mi Jung, answer.

536
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:55,800
The number you dial is not available.

537
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:58,700
Daejeon. LLéveme a Daejeon.

538
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:30,700
Where are you, Mi Jung?

539
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:32,300
I am at the cinema.

540
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:39,900
Why are you there? Why are you there?

541
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:43,900
Mi-jung, are you in there?

542
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:45,900
- Joon Seo. - Mi-Jung!

543
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:47,500
- Joon Seo, do you hear me? - Mi-Jung!

544
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:22,300
Mi-jung! Mi-jung! Mi-jung!
