TWENTY-FOUR-HOUR SECURITY VIDEO RECORDING

3
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,081
Nothing wrong with it, right?

4
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,085
What the hell?

5
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:33,254
-Are you drunk?
-Call the cops now!

6
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:24,013
I never dreamed you'd be a mole.

7
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,724
I'm sorry. Please spare me.

8
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,644
Sung-geun, Yong-soo, Victor…

9
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,021
All dead. Because of you.

10
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,941
-Please.
-Who's behind all this?

11
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,568
Tell me. There's no time!

12
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,280
I’m sorry.

13
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,215
-Freeze!
-Hands up! Turn yourself in!

14
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,286
It's me. I'm folding.

15
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,954
Clean up, and don't look for me.

FOUR YEARS LATER, SEOUL

17
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,293
<i>Well after midnight,</i>
<i>Chairman Lee of Sang-in Group</i>

18
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:21,130
is still being questioned for charges
of bribery and stock manipulation.

19
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,924
According to the Prosecutor's Office,

20
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,759
<i>if Chairman Lee continues</i>

21
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:27,345
<i>to deny the charges against him,</i>

22
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:31,432
<i>an arrest warrant cannot be ruled out.</i>

23
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,145
Tired?

24
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,481
Shall we take a break?

25
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,442
Just be honest with me here.

26
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,154
Why are you so obsessed with nailing me?

27
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,408
Nailing you?

28
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,494
If you committed a crime,
you should pay for it.

29
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:55,623
It seems everyone else
is scared to touch you,

30
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,126
but not me.

31
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,129
So you want me behind bars?

32
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,381
Yes.

33
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,635
You think you can do it?

34
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,722
I'll give it my best effort.

35
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,195
Close the door.

36
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:29,991
We've got a problem.

37
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,744
A violation in the investigation.

38
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:36,873
What violation?

39
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:42,295
Your investigators
entered their office illegally.

40
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,505
I apologize.

41
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,925
It seems we fell for a trap.

42
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,053
They haven't said
anything about it just yet,

43
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:54,056
but as soon as we try to arrest him,
they'll use it against us.

44
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,727
Nobody here is going to talk.

45
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,023
So whatever happens,
you have to play dumb.

46
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,569
Say it never happened.

47
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,155
You get what I mean?

48
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,577
No, I can't do that.

49
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,829
Are you kidding?

50
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,456
After all we've done?

51
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,416
We committed a crime to catch a criminal!

52
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:25,713
We sunk to their level.
Justice is preserved by being just.

53
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:29,800
Get the camera!

54
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,677
Is the investigation over?

55
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,221
How do you feel right now?

56
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,681
What was the reason
for this interrogation?

57
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,725
Have you really been unfairly targeted?

58
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:38,643
Chairman Lee.

59
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:52,365
I gave you my card,
but you threw it out in the restroom.

60
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:56,160
Sorry, I didn't think I'd be needing it.

61
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:57,787
Take it.

62
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,165
I'm going to make sure
you come back here.

64
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,796
I like you.

65
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,382
You've got attitude.

66
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,552
Call me if you get fired.

67
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,595
I'll help you find another job.

68
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,682
What's that?

69
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,475
Is that blood?

70
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:27,650
Right.

71
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,236
That's how to bow to me.

72
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,910
What were you two talking about?

73
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,830
Was there any mistreatment?

74
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,209
Wait, sir!

75
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,877
Thanks, please come again.

76
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,588
-Miss.
-Yes?

77
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,382
-One lemon soda, please.
-Lemon soda?

78
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,010
Miss! Please clear these dishes.

79
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,553
I'll be right there!

80
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,471
Can I take your order?

81
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:00,766
-One beef, two ox blood stews.
-Coming right up.

83
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,686
One beef and two ox bloods for table two.

84
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:05,396
Hey.

85
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:16,782
What is it?

86
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:17,700
Huh?

87
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,994
Nothing, just eat.

88
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:20,953
-Eat up.
-Eat up.

89
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:21,871
Okay.

90
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,042

<i>This is Hong Ji-hye of YTN.</i>

Don't be too upset.

98
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,566
I'm okay.

99
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,445
Right. Use this opportunity

101
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,284
I didn't quit.

102
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,414

Doesn't that mean you're fired?

Administration of NIS prosecutors, well…

106
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,686
It involves legal advice, assistance,

107

interior reviews, that kind of thing.

108
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:32,692
Sounds impressive,
but people here do it all themselves,

109
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,402
so we don't really do much work.

110
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,570
No, don't get up.

111
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,662
Have a smoke.

112
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:47,456
We're at the end of the hall,
so it's okay.

113
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,624
No one comes here.

114
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,585
No, thanks. I don't smoke.

115
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,547
Oh.

116
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,800
You're pretty straight-laced, aren't you?

117
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,512
You can relax here.

118
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:04,473
All that clenching of fists,
gritting of teeth…

119
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,726
It's exhausting.

120
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:13,899
I know about your accomplishments.

Don't talk of the past.

123
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,032
They say the job makes the man.

124
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,075

Oh, gosh.

00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,560
This is my third year.

151
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:17,314
But you're turning down
this chance to be reinstated?

152
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,193
I'd love to go back, of course.

153
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,152
Really.

154
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,239
But I can't leave now.

155
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,157
There's my wife's health,

Sorry to interrupt.

158
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:37,334
But if it's possible, could I go?

159
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,005
Yes, that's right.

160
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,048
Han can go.

00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,386
Ma'am.
This man here is no ordinary prosecutor.

162
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:52,308
He's the one who took on Sang-in Group.

00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,563
Oh, wait a second.

165
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,940
You speak Chinese too, right?

166
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,692
You trained in Beijing?

167
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:05,613
If I could get reinstated
to my old position,

168
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,573

Because of that,

177
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,554
the intel related to activities
in Shenyang is very limited.

178
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,014

with black teams
engaged in secret operations,

180
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,229
it's an unwritten rule

So did some problem emerge there?

183
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,195
We've learned

184
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,114
the last few months of reports
we got from Shenyang

185
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,909
are entirely fake.

186
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,621
We've no choice but to order a review.

187
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:58,123
What's behind those fake reports,

188
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,710
what kind of illegal activity
is going on there…

189
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,880
<i>That's what you have to find out</i>
<i>in Shenyang.</i>

190
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,217
I'm busy. I'm at the airport.

191
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,096
I'm not flying anywhere.

192
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:14,890
Give me a break.

193
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,312
ADVISORY ISSUED
FOR NORTH KOREAN BORDER REGIONS

194
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,566
TECHMON INC
MANAGER HAN JI-HOON

195
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,693
Yeah. Who knows?

196
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,736
Some jerk is coming from Seoul.

197
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,946
It's so annoying.

198
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,702
TECHMON INC
MANAGER HAN JI-HOON

199
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,620
I mean,

200
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,248
we only got the call this morning.

201
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,793
Such a sudden visit,
and no time to prepare.

202
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,503
We're just a little blindsided.

203
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:48,340
Those guys in Seoul
can't do anything right.

204
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:51,552
They should get a taste of the real world…

205
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:57,725
Not what you expected?

206
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:01,353
This is not like a typical Chinese city
you would've imagined

207
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,188
like Beijing or Shanghai.

208
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,024
It’s a city of heavy industry.

209
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:08,444
The outskirts are full of steelworks
and chemical plants,

210
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,739
filled with factory chimney smoke

211
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:14,199
and crows flying above.

212
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,285
-And spies too.
-What?

213
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:20,289
I heard this city has
the highest density of spies.

214
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,207
With North Korea right in front,

215
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,918
you get spies
from China, Japan, USA, Russia.

216
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:29,339
They say everyone here
is either a spy or an agent.

217
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,467
Who said that? HQ?

218
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,885
Is it not true?

219
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:35,179
<i>James Bond? Mission Impossible?</i>

220
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:42,561
I'm afraid
I'm going to have to burst your bubble.

221
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:53,280
SAMJIN TRAVEL AGENCY

222
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:59,953
SAMJIN TRAVEL AGENCY

223
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,039
Welcome to the Shenyang branch

224
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,458
of Korea's Intelligence Service.

225
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,876
Get him some tea.

226
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,089
Hello?

227
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,925
Mr. Chang! How can I help you?

228
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,135
What?

229
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:17,971
"Fang Defeng"?

230
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,474
Wow, your pronunciation.
Thought you were Chinese.

231
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:23,143
-Not your real name, is it?
-Of course not.

232
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,022
How long has
this travel agency been a front?

233
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:31,610
Not sure, it was like this
when I arrived three years ago.

234
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:37,366
And it's not a disguise.
As you can see, it's a real company.

235
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,284
We mainly do tours to Mt. Baekdu,

236
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,913
but with the bad economy,
we don't get a lot of customers.

237
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,623
And those employees?

238
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:48,585
Those two ladies are real travel agents.

239
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,505
The short-haired girl
and the sleazy-looking guy are agents.

240
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:52,965
You two, say hi.

241
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,425
He's the prosecutor from Seoul.

242
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,515
Hey, where are the paper cups?

243
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,100
They're down below.

244
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,647
Must be something in the water.
Their manners…

245
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,566
Please excuse them.

246
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,359
"Wei Longping."

247
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,111
Is that Branch Manager Ji Kang-in?

248
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,696
That's right.

249
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,197
Where is he now?

250
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,575
On a business trip.

251
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:22,870
Where?

252
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,748
I'm afraid
we have to keep that confidential.

253
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:29,793
Don't you know why I'm here?

254
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:37,342
I want a report
on agents' activities, transfers of…

255
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,636
Excuse me.

256
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,515
Mr. Kim!

257
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,767
Why's it so hard to reach you?

258
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,186
Really?

259
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:51,565
Don't lie to me like last time.

260
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,525
Okay.

261
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,652
You think I won't pay you back?

262
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,406
Come on. Okay.

263
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,575
All right, I'll see you then.

264
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,745
Never work on an empty stomach.

265
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,580
Let's have an early dinner.

266
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,582
A Shenyang culinary tour awaits you.

267
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,918
-Let's see…
-Where's the restroom?

268
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,794
Down the hall on the left.

269
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,672
Wait, take the key.

270
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:39,696
Hey. What do you think you're doing?

271
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,615
Where are you all going?

272
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,575
Get out.

273
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:47,454
If an inspector asks where you're going,
you must answer.

274
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:50,582
We'll be late.

275
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:55,754
An urgent call from Manager Ji.
Okay? Get out.

276
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:58,340
What kind of urgent call
requires so much cash?

277
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,885
I hear Manager Ji is a great gambler.

278
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,137
Did he lose a lot today?

279
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,723
-Great. Let's go together.
-Sir!

280
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,226
-I'll introduce myself.
-Sir.

281
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,894
Please get out now.

282
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,313
You really can't do this.

283
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,526
-Sir, please don't do this.
-This prosecutor's a tough guy.

284
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,528
-This is not the restroom.
-Dives right in.

285
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,821
Jeong-dae, the door…

286
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,447
Whatever.

287
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:23,991
Open the door!

288
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,702
Jae-gyu! Hey!

289
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,412
Hui-won, stop!

290
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,247
Shit.

291
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,277
Who's this?

292
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:05,365
Prosecutor Han Ji-hoon,
dispatched as a special inspector.

293
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,494
Put a vest on him.

294
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,084
-Wait. What are you doing?
-Stay still.

295
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,962
-Let go of me.
-Dude, just put it on.

296
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,006
-You do that side.
-Raise your arms.

297
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,717
-Why do I need to wear this?
-Stop talking.

298
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,135
God, this dust.

299
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:29,473
What is this, a party? Why so many people?

300
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:33,018
Wow, you even brought a civilian?

301
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,812
Ignore him. Just lead the way.

302
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,274
First things first. Give me the money.

303
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,474
If the goods are damaged,
I won't be happy.

304
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,309
That's not my responsibility.

305
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,353
Ask yourself.

306
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:36,164
Professor Wang, are you screwing with me?

307
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,999
Give us Room 39.

308
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,545
What is this bullshit?

309
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:44,214
You guys work it out. I'm off!

310
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,969
Wang, that asshole.

311
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:49,886
Tell us!

312
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,054
Where is he?

313
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,267
Look.

314
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,727
What's going on here?

315
00:23:58,812 --> 00:23:59,855
<i>Shots fired.</i>

316
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,523
Get in the car and stay down.

317
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,035
Hold your fire.

318
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,013
Situation resolved.

319
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,641
TEXTILE FACTORY THREE

320
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:30,278
No need to check. It's the North Koreans.

321
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,789
This rat had his escape all planned out.

322
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,333
Had another car parked in the back.

323
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,047
Why do this to me?

324
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:50,882
I'm sorry.

325
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:55,262
They threatened
to kill my wife and kids. I had to.

326
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:59,015
You had to deceive both sides
and set up a gunfight?

327
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,016
Who planned it?

328
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:02,561
I…

329
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:07,315
I really can't say.

330
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,028
I understand.

331
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,241
Please!

332
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:18,702
-How long have we known each other!
-Stop.

333
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:21,913
What are you doing?
Who are you to threaten--

334
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:31,590
Pull out.

335
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,842
Where are you taking me?

336
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,303
Huh? Where?

337
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,847
Please, Yaksha! I'm sorry!

338
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:54,070
Hey. Would you press here?

339
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,992
Hey…

340
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,286
Ouch, my head.

341
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,663
-Hey.
-Damn it.

342
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:48,625
I'm cold.

343
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,006
Where the hell is this?

344
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:57,676
Get up.

345
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,428
-Hey.
-Leave me alone.

346
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:11,648
Open up!

347
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,903
Open up! It's the police!

348
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:20,323
Open the door!

349
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:26,663
POLICE

350
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,587
Oh, damn it.

351
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,089
Freeze!

352
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:38,341
He might jump. I'll go downstairs.

353
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:41,761
Hey.

354
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,889
Stay away!

355
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:45,807
Stay back!

356
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:47,684
Stay away.

357
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:48,852
Stop right there!

358
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,024
Come here!

359
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:00,155
Come here! Let's go down and talk.

360
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,114
I didn't do it.

361
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:03,116
Come back here! Let's go down and talk.

362
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,708
Stop, come back!

363
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,627
Wait, don't!

364
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,181
Come on, get him!

365
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,266
What are you doing? Hurry up!

366
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:31,227
Hurry up! Hey! Stop!

367
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,188
That way!

368
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,242
Hey!

369
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,472
That bastard.

370
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,233
I thought you'd get caught like an idiot.

371
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,068
But you made it out.

372
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:22,862
I don't like your games.

373
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:25,031
Pretty good for a nerd.

374
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,407
Do you work out?

375
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,410
What are you, a gangster? A hoodlum?

376
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:30,954
Both.

377
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,585
I don't know
what you came here to inspect,

378
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,629
but I don't have time for it.

379
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:44,342
I'll have Hong write up a nice report,

380
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,470
so take that and leave quietly.

381
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:50,765
Not a chance.

382
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:55,562
I'll report everything I saw
and went through today,

383
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:56,646
in detail.

384
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:59,315
They hang people
for drug offenses here, you know.

385
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,484
I'm going to call the cops now.

386
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:02,485
Try it.

387
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:07,073
I'm used to dealing with thugs like you.

388
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:09,325
Guess I won't need to call.

389
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:21,337
Damn it.

390
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,381
Please respond.

391
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,528
<i>Beware of the leader there.</i>

392
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,363
<i>Branch Manager Ji Kang-in.</i>

393
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:51,367
He's mostly run foreign operations,

394
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:53,661
<i>and each time, he causes headaches</i>

395
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,080
for the Ministry with his methods.

396
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,791
But one way or another,
he achieves his goal…

397
00:31:58,875 --> 00:31:59,792
JI KANG-IN

398
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,755
<i>…so the higher-ups tend</i>
<i>to let him get on with it.</i>

399
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,966
<i>His nickname is Yaksha?</i>

400
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:10,219
A hideous, violent spirit
that eats people.

401
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:16,017
<i>But it's also called a guardian</i>
<i>of Buddhist faith.</i>

402
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,812
Wherever it came from,
it's the perfect nickname.

403
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,649
<i>Impossible to control, unpredictable,</i>

404
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,944
like a time bomb.

405
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:27,820
Don't ever trust him.

406
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:34,702
What is that?

407
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,747
Don't worry.
She may bite, but she's not poisonous.

408
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,500
Is our Lizzie hungry?

409
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,170
You've been outside again!

410
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:46,297
I'll put a collar on you.

411
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,135
Jeez.

412
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,141
You're a spy sent by HQ, right?

413
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,896
Is that your name for a special inspector?

414
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:05,358
They told you to find out everything?

415
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:08,569
What they're scheming in Shenyang,

416
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,613
and what trouble they're causing.

417
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,158
Let's start.

418
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,786
Are you sure?

419
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:20,373
Once you watch this,
you're wading into the sewer.

420
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,922
This was taken a week ago,
at Dongbei Bank.

421
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:31,384
It's the former Shenyang branch
of Daesong Bank from North Korea.

422
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,555
A shootout occurred
between two unidentified groups.

423
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:38,808
The target of both groups
was that middle-aged man.

424
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,520
The first group to arrive

425
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:46,107
was identified
as North Korea's Supreme Guard.

426
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:49,110
The ones who attacked us today.

427
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,446
But the other group…

428
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,575
we aren't able to identify.

429
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:57,994
Who is that guy to cause such a struggle?

430
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:04,208
The head of Room 39. Moon Byung-uk.

431
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:10,173
During the shootout,
he climbed over the wall and ran away.

432
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:12,133
He hasn't been seen since then.

433
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,177
You know who Moon Byung-uk is?

434
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,972
-Who is he?
-You really want us to continue?

435
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:28,524
"Room 39" is a group
within North Korea's Central Committee.

436
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,319
It raises foreign currency,

437
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,238
and maintains the Kim family's slush fund.

438
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,199
It has four trillion won stashed abroad,

439
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,285
and the one who controls it all

440
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:41,913
is Moon Byung-uk.

441
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:45,750
But how are all of you
involved in this incident?

442
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:50,671
A month ago, Moon reached out to us,
asking for protection.

443
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,675
We were waiting at the meeting point,

444
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,469
but Room 39 never showed up.

445
00:34:57,053 --> 00:35:00,431
That's when all this happened
in front of the bank.

446
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:02,100
You know what that means?

447
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,936
North Korea, China,

448
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:07,855
and some unknown third party
clashed over Moon.

449
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,566
If our involvement is leaked,

450
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,735
it'll be a major diplomatic crisis.

451
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:17,281
Before that happens, we need to find
and secure Moon as planned.

452
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,540
Hey, Prosecutor.

453
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,209
Did you do your army service?

454
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,753
You're in deep shit now.

455
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,755
This afternoon was just a teaser.

456
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:35,591
The real war starts now.

457
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:38,803
When we told you to go home,

458
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,930
you should've thanked us and left.

459
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,402
MINE CLOSED
NO ENTRY

460
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,531
Shoot!

461
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,914
You seem different
from those other shit brains,

462
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,124
so I filled you in.

463
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:11,919
Lie low until we wrap things up.
Won't be long.

464
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,714
Don't you think
you should have filed a report?

465
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:21,137
Do all prosecutors
talk down to people this way?

466
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,346
You started it.

467
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:25,391
Answer the question.
Why didn't you report it?

468
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:28,394
And how long should I wait for approval?

469
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,396
Okay, I'll report on it now.

470
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,107
Prepare to dispatch.

471
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:46,495
It's okay, talk. He knows it all anyway.

472
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,248
Hong called.

473
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:52,585
It seems Professor Wang
got the order from the Japanese.

474
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:57,715
Last week, he met
with a Japanese agent in Xita district.

475
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:59,008
Plus, the Russians say

476
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:01,594
someone is being held
at Big East Building.

477
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,179
Big East?

478
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:05,389
Dainichi Electronics?

479
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:10,770
We better get moving.

480
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:12,939
As soon as it's ready, we'll go in.

481
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:15,733
Then I'll…

482
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:20,071
Come with me.

483
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,073
What are you thinking?

484
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,786
We should feed him. He's a guest.

485
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:37,171
Put your seatbelt on.

486
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:44,011
Damn it.

487
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:49,558
You remind me of something.

488
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:52,478
The white Nikes
my class monitor wore at school.

489
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,606
I stepped all over them.

490
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:58,567
Where are we going?

491
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,778
You're an inspector. Time to inspect.

492
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,504
Here's what you asked for.

493
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,759
Your side hasn't found Room 39?

494
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:27,805
Not sure.

495
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,560
No, we haven't.

496
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:38,899
Is D7 in Shenyang, by any chance?

497
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:44,947
So he is.

498
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:48,534
Where might he be?

499
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:51,287
I'll find out and contact you.

500
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:01,172
Switch off the lights
and leave through the kitchen.

501
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,221
Who is she?

502
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,223
An agent from State Security.

503
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:12,725
North Korea?

504
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,144
Then what did you give her?

505
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,813
It's all give and take.

506
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:21,901
Can't do anything
in this field without intel.

507
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,613
It’s like blood.

508
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,493
It needs to flow.
What happens when it clogs?

509
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:31,410
You blow up.

510
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,755
Let's get to work now.

511
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,968
BIG EAST

512
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,474
What brings you here?

513
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:56,394
We're fixing a line on the 34th floor.

514
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:05,569
Thank you.

515
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,456
The 67th floor is a separate block.

516
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,083
If we black out one block,

517
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,335
the lights and security will go out.

518
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,796
Let's limit our contact with them.

519
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:33,055
Who are you?

520
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:37,685
Who the hell are you?

521
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:48,696
Hey.

522
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,282
Are you D7?

523
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:53,784
I'll count to three.

524
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,704
Where is Moon Byung-uk?

525
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:58,956
One.

526
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:01,709
Two.

527
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,684
Keep your manners.

528
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:21,770
Disrespect

529
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,815
is always repaid in kind.

530
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:39,288
<i>The center of world power</i>
<i>is returning to Northeast Asia.</i>

531
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:44,919
<i>This, more than anything else,</i>

532
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,129
calls for strong solidarity in Asia.

533
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:50,716
It's also the reason
I came to be with you today.

534
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:52,426
Shall we raise a toast to that?

535
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:59,141
I thought I wouldn't see you
until next year in Hong Kong.

536
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:00,309
Thanks for coming.

537
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:03,229
He didn't think he'd see you…

538
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:25,459
-I'll see you again.
-See you.

539
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:33,425
You're still alive?

540
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:40,140
Sure. I don't die so easily.

541
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,353
I told you about him before, right?

542
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:48,607
Mr. Ozawa Yoshinobu.

543
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,987
He started at CIRO,
Japan's intelligence agency,

544
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:56,448
but now he works as a lobbyist.

545
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,410
Say hello.

546
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:06,375
This is Jiang Wen,
from Chinese Special Forces.

547
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:13,924
I've heard much about you. I'm Jiang Wen.

548
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:17,720
It's an honor to meet you.

549
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:19,346
Not at all.

550
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,308
It's nice to meet you.

551
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:25,311
Apologies for my broken Chinese.

552
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:26,812
Not at all.

553
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,940
My Japanese is far from perfect.

554
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:43,871
So what brings you here?

555
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:47,416
You're not the type of guy
who hangs out at places like this.

556
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:51,545
Jiang Wen here is a wine lover.

557
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:56,508
What about you?
What are you doing in Shenyang?

558
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,054
I just needed a change of scenery.

559
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:06,602
You didn't harm
Professor Wang's family, did you?

560
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:12,024
You almost got me killed
in broad daylight.

561
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:17,571
Hey.

562
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:21,492
Have you forgotten
that I'm with a commissioned officer?

563
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:27,081
Touch them,
and that'll be the end for you all.

564
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:29,583
Four years ago,

565
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:34,880
you ruined me in Hong Kong,
and I barely recovered.

566
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:37,591
Since then,

567
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:40,094
I never stopped thinking of you.

568
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:46,058
Sounds like you're in love with me.

569
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:48,435
It is love.

570
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,188
A match made in heaven.

571
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:53,899
And now we meet again.

572
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:58,821
This time I'm going to skin you alive.

573
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,699
Just you wait.

574
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:08,956
As usual,
you have no sense of dignity whatsoever.

575
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,918
How long do you intend to work like this?

576
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:16,505
You're no different from a cheap hoodlum.

577
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:18,716
We're two of a kind.

578
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:19,883
Asshole.

579
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,903
Leaving already? Something came up?

580
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:44,450
Seeing your face, Yaksha…

581
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:48,704
has ruined the taste of the wine.

582
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,590
You're more quick-witted than I thought.

583
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,387
Was that D7?

584
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:09,475
He's a Japanese spy
disguised as a lobbyist.

585
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:12,352
For espionage, he's the best in Asia.

586
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:14,646
Why did he just rush off?

587
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:17,941
It means our team has reached the target.

588
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:21,111
By target, you mean Room 39?

589
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:59,733
Things just got much more serious.

590
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,860
-Let's hurry.
-Yes, sir.

591
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:17,292
Where's Moon?

592
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:30,848
What's this?

593
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:35,018
Moon wasn't there, only this woman.

594
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:39,147
-Who is she?
-She won't say.

595
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:41,066
Who she is, why she was there…

596
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:45,821
Then rip her mouth open if you have to.

597
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:47,281
You just going to stand there?

598
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:00,878
I asked around.

599
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:03,171
They captured her

600
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:06,383
just after the shootout at Dongbei Bank.

601
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:11,096
I think maybe they're using her
as a hostage to get Moon.

602
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:15,559
Are you Moon's girlfriend?

603
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:17,644
Fuck off, your breath stinks.

604
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:20,731
Where is he now?

605
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,534
Is this how you solve everything?

606
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:34,912
You're no different
from a bunch of gangsters.

607
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:39,166
Do you want to die?

608
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:44,922
Make her talk before dawn.

609
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:49,051
And lock this guy up
so he can't go anywhere.

610
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,684
How long will you live like this?

611
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:01,480
You're one to talk.

612
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:03,857
I'm going to quit.

613
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:07,069
That can get you killed. Be careful.

614
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:11,323
You be careful.

615
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:13,909
Things are really tense right now.

616
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:18,622
Our side believes
the South is hiding Moon.

617
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:21,583
Idiots.

618
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:25,796
State Security is going to
send more agents.

619
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:32,552
I've been ordered
to keep my eye on the South's agents.

620
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:36,515
You're doing that right now.

621
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:38,100
Need to do a bit more.

622
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:49,403
Do you know who this is?

623
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:52,656
You're holding her?

624
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:54,866
Who is she?

625
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,162
Moon's daughter.

626
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:01,999
<i>Raised her in Beijing</i>
<i>in secret from the party.</i>

627
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:05,877
She's his only blood relative.

628
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,006
<i>What is that?</i>

629
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,382
Electric current.

630
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:13,051
Great for loosening tongues.

631
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,303
You guys don't use this?

632
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:25,230
Move, and I'll stab you.

633
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:49,671
Judo? Not bad.

634
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:03,226
From the start I never liked you.

635
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:06,646
Arrogant prick.

636
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:18,075
Drop the knife, or die.

637
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:44,893
Are you okay?

638
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,395
Don't worry.

639
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:49,397
I'm a South Korean prosecutor.

640
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:53,360
I'll take you
to the South Korean consulate,

641
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:56,196
and then call the Chinese police.

642
00:51:58,740 --> 00:51:59,866
Pull over.

643
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:13,296
Wait a minute.

644
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:43,869
<i>Director Yeom? It's Han Ji-hoon.</i>

645
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,204
Prosecutor Han!

646
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:48,290
<i>What's going on?</i>

647
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:52,127
<i>It's clear that Ji Kang-in</i>
<i>is plotting something.</i>

648
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:56,173
<i>From her accent,</i>
<i>the vanished hostage was North Korean.</i>

649
00:52:56,673 --> 00:53:00,343
So you're no longer
with Ji Kang-in, right?

650
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:05,015
Anyway, seeing as even Japan is involved,

651
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:07,726
the situation is much more serious
than expected.

652
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:10,353
<i>Are you okay? You're not hurt?</i>

653
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:11,730
Yes, I'm fine.

654
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:17,527
I'll call the Consulate General,
so head over there for now.

655
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:18,486
No.

656
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:20,739
With things in this state,

657
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:23,450
I'll need to observe more closely.

658
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:26,411
Yes.

659
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:29,372
Hello?

660
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:30,290
Baby.

661
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:32,500
You need anything?

662
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:41,051
No, I'm fine.

663
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:42,594
It's okay.

664
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:45,472
Tell me what you want. My name's Eleven.

665
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,934
This is my neighborhood.

666
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:53,855
Out of the way.

667
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:55,398
This is crazy.

668
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:57,400
You're not from here.

669
00:53:57,984 --> 00:54:00,528
You look so tired.

670
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:03,406
Lie down for a bit.

671
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:05,909
Let go!

672
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:19,839
Wait. Hey.

673
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:25,178
This will buy you an overnight.
I'll make you happy.

674
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,346
Let's go.

675
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,640
-Don't get yourself hurt.
-Come quietly.

676
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,350
You're making a mistake.

677
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:31,601
Hey, Nike!

678
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:36,106
You know what kind of place this is?

679
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:39,025
Let him go.

680
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:43,363
They'll lead off a dupe like you,

681
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:46,992
and cut out your kidneys
and everything else.

682
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:54,457
Let's go.

683
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:04,509
Why does a shithead like you butt in
and screw everything up!

684
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:17,439
I told you to lie low, asshole!

685
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,444
I'm a prosecutor.

686
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:25,864
You abduct, assault,
and even torture people!

687
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:28,992
Do you expect me to just sit and watch?
You scumbag!

688
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:33,872
Wait.

689
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:42,422
Damn it!

690
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:07,280
So, where is she?

691
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:09,532
She ran off.

692
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:13,119
She's Moon's daughter, idiot!

693
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:15,080
You ruined everything!

694
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:19,584
Did she say anything to you?

695
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:24,130
She told me to get out and drove off.

696
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,048
Jeez.

697
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:34,682
Why is Japan getting involved in this?

698
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:40,647
And what is it with you
and that guy Ozawa?

699
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,696
We've got memories, for sure.

700
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:51,199
It's none of your business, forget it.

701
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:53,368
I can't do that.

702
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:59,165
You will easily get 25 years
for what you did today.

703
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,168
I won't ignore it.

704
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:05,296
I'll investigate and prosecute
according to the law.

705
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,676
And then you'll be reinstated?

706
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:12,929
I know everything.

707
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,223
About Sang-in Group,

708
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:17,725
your demotion to NIS,
volunteering to come here.

709
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:21,729
You want to prove yourself here
and return to the Prosecution.

710
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:23,106
Am I right?

711
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:26,067
That's right.

712
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:29,487
I need to go back there.

713
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:31,781
Then I'll nail Sang-in Group.

714
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:35,201
When rich people with power commit crimes,

715
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,831
more people than you'd think

716
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,750
are hurt for a very long time.

717
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:48,631
Any lawbreaking bastard
who gets caught by me will…

718
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:49,674
Damn it.

719
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:52,427
Thank you.

720
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:02,479
Close the door.

721
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:13,406
What?

722
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:22,248
Looking for a tracker?

723
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:25,543
Nobody uses those anymore.

724
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:31,716
After wiping that on you, we can track you
by satellite for 18 hours.

725
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:34,594
It's the first thing we do
when a guest comes.

726
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:35,762
In case they run.

727
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:39,182
She's stopped.

728
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:43,311
-Where?
-By the Korean village in Heping District.

729
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:44,729
Twenty-three minutes away.

730
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:48,399
Let's go. Get there in five minutes.

731
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:50,485
Okay, five minutes.

732
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:31,317
This is an operation.

733
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:32,735
Keep your cool, okay?

734
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:46,457
Hey.

735
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:50,753
How long have you worked with Ji Kang-in?

736
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:54,382
So now you're inspecting us?

737
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:58,428
Humor me, will you?

738
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,599
<i>Hui-won's been the longest.</i>

739
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,892
<i>Next is Jae-gyu.</i>

740
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:08,062
<i>Me, about three years?</i>

741
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:13,234
<i>I got roped in while traveling in Cairo.</i>

742
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:19,073
Did he run around
shooting people then, too?

743
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:23,161
What do you think?
That's what all black teams do.

744
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:34,881
<i>Since we'd all be dead without him,</i>

745
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,966
<i>we follow his every word.</i>

746
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:44,098
If he told us to die, we really would.

747
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:07,121
What? She's moving.

748
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:22,345
Sir, it looks like
the squirrel slipped out.

749
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:26,474
Police.

750
01:01:30,144 --> 01:01:31,771
<i>Mobilize quickly!</i>

751
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:34,607
<i>A shootout in Heping District 26-7!</i>

752
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:37,985
<i>Combatants are armed and unidentified.</i>
<i>Backup requested.</i>

753
01:01:40,321 --> 01:01:41,322
Moon Byung-uk?

754
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:44,617
The cops are here, withdraw.

755
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:45,910
Do you hear me?

756
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:47,954
What's wrong?

757
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:49,956
I think the signal's being blocked.

758
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,582
I can't reach them.

759
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:56,254
He's been shot in the abdomen,
at point blank.

760
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:57,171
It's a trap.

761
01:01:58,297 --> 01:02:00,258
Are you good at running?

762
01:02:00,341 --> 01:02:03,094
<i>All units, seize the group</i>
<i>of unidentified, armed combatants.</i>

763
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:08,641
Come out quick. The police are here.

764
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:11,686
Moon.

765
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:12,770
Can you hear me?

766
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:15,648
Where's the thing
you were going to give me?

767
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:19,068
I am…

768
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:21,070
useless now.

769
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:24,532
My daughter.

770
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:28,077
My daughter Ju-yeon.

771
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:32,582
Whatever happens,

772
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,919
don't let the Japanese get her.

773
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:47,930
<i>Shoot them dead if they resist.</i>

774
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:50,349
<i>This is a residential area, so be careful.</i>

775
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:51,934
<i>Do not harm the civilians.</i>

776
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:27,345
-Vision impaired due to smoke bomb!
-We need backup.

777
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:41,067
<i>Group B, move quickly</i>
<i>to Zone C flyover and block them off.</i>

778
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:48,366
Three men down! We need backup!

779
01:04:15,476 --> 01:04:16,310
Let's go.

780
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:22,692
<i>We need backup!</i>

781
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:30,116
Freeze! Put down your guns!

782
01:04:54,765 --> 01:04:56,893
-Jump.
-What?

783
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:58,394
I said, jump.

784
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:02,398
I have a fear of heights.

785
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:22,335
Oh, damn it.

786
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:23,252
Freeze!

787
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:26,923
On the ground!

788
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:40,645
SAMJIN TRAVEL AGENCY

789
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:43,731
Reporting in.
We're keeping guard at the intersection.

790
01:05:43,814 --> 01:05:46,651
Boss, the police are searching our office.

791
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:50,488
I think he's the one who planned this.

792
01:05:50,571 --> 01:05:51,656
Did you clean up?

793
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:54,450
Don't worry, it's clean.

794
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:55,868
All right.

795
01:05:57,912 --> 01:05:59,246
Turn the car around.

796
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,416
They've sacked the travel agency.

797
01:06:13,886 --> 01:06:15,304
Let's close the shutter.

798
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:17,473
What?

799
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:22,269
<i>It's obvious they'll search there, too.</i>

800
01:06:23,688 --> 01:06:24,647
<i>Close the shutter.</i>

801
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:25,815
Right now?

802
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:52,133
They must've hacked
into our tracking system.

803
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:55,928
And the Chinese police's timing
was too perfect.

804
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:07,982
Damn it. What about Lizzie?

805
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:13,904
What are you looking at?

806
01:07:14,405 --> 01:07:16,240
This is all your fault.

807
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:18,409
Let go of me.

808
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:21,662
Let go, damn it!

809
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:24,665
He screwed up everything.

810
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:28,919
What'll you do now?
Make up for it, asshole!

811
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:32,548
Calm down, will you?

812
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:35,426
What's the real reason
you looked for Moon?

813
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:39,764
Real reason?

814
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:43,642
Right. Not your fake reports,

815
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:46,604
but the real reason
you've kept this secret.

816
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:50,608
I heard. He planned to give you something.

817
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:52,318
What was it?

818
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:55,696
The secret fund that he oversaw.

819
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:57,156
Four trillion won.

820
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:59,825
You're all fighting over it, aren't you?

821
01:08:01,952 --> 01:08:05,206
I heard you embezzled funds
for foreign operations.

822
01:08:05,289 --> 01:08:08,626
And the higher-ups in Korea
just let it slide.

823
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:12,630
You really think we're some kind of trash.

824
01:08:12,713 --> 01:08:13,589
Aren't you?

825
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:16,217
If not, pull it.

826
01:08:17,009 --> 01:08:18,010
Pull the trigger.

827
01:08:18,886 --> 01:08:19,887
Put that away.

828
01:08:22,306 --> 01:08:24,100
<i>Looks like game over, no?</i>

829
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:25,101
Ozawa.

830
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:28,020
You came quite prepared.

831
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:31,732
You shouldn't take other people's things.

832
01:08:31,816 --> 01:08:33,109
Still,

833
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:36,612
hitting our home seems a bit extreme.

834
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:39,740
It's for the best.

835
01:08:40,324 --> 01:08:44,912
How about leaving here in the morning?

836
01:08:46,163 --> 01:08:47,748
I won't leave

837
01:08:48,415 --> 01:08:50,960
without taking care of you.

838
01:08:51,043 --> 01:08:53,087
<i>You don't have many options.</i>

839
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:56,006
Since you killed Moon Byung-uk.

840
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:57,925
What?

841
01:08:58,008 --> 01:09:02,138
At 8 a.m., a wanted notice
will go out all over China.

842
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:05,933
Newspapers, TV, internet…

843
01:09:06,684 --> 01:09:09,812
Your faces will be everywhere.

844
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:12,690
<i>Your days working in China are finished.</i>

845
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:15,651
Boarding a ship won't be easy.

846
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:19,780
I recommend crossing
the Russian border before dawn.

847
01:09:19,864 --> 01:09:22,116
<i>As an admirer of your talent,</i>

848
01:09:22,199 --> 01:09:24,869
I'm doing you this last favor.

849
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:57,401
<i>The shootout continued until midnight,</i>

850
01:09:57,484 --> 01:09:59,904
<i>and one could tell</i>
<i>the situation was very urgent.</i>

851
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:02,865
<i>The shattered windows</i>
<i>and the holes in the walls</i>

852
01:10:02,948 --> 01:10:04,700
<i>show the aftermath of the shootout.</i>

853
01:10:04,783 --> 01:10:08,621
China's Security Ministry
is blaming it on the police.

854
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:11,332
Means they don't want to help.

855
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:15,294
Director, I've found
a means of contacting Hong.

856
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:17,379
<i>I went out to check on my kid.</i>

857
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:19,840
Getting Han out of there
is our first priority.

858
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:21,008
Get ready to fly there.

859
01:10:21,091 --> 01:10:25,971
<i>I suddenly heard some commotion,</i>
<i>sound of glass breaking.</i>

860
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:28,849
<i>I was terrified.</i>
<i>This has never happened before.</i>

861
01:10:28,933 --> 01:10:31,936
<i>I couldn't believe</i>
<i>it was happening right in front of me.</i>

862
01:10:32,019 --> 01:10:32,853
Here.

863
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:35,481
You're starting to smell.

864
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:41,528
Damn.

865
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:45,032
I don't know what you think of us,

866
01:10:45,115 --> 01:10:46,617
but let me explain one thing.

867
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:49,954
Embezzling the operation funds…

868
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:53,332
You're right, it's true. A lot of money.

869
01:10:55,292 --> 01:10:56,377
But that money

870
01:10:57,503 --> 01:11:02,132
was sent to the families
of team members who died on duty.

871
01:11:03,968 --> 01:11:06,595
The HQ found out later and let it slide.

872
01:11:08,222 --> 01:11:11,183
For Yaksha, money has no meaning.

873
01:11:12,184 --> 01:11:13,560
You get my point?

874
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:15,938
Eat your food.

875
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:30,369
Sorry to show up in this state

876
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:33,122
after so long.

877
01:11:34,748 --> 01:11:36,083
I'm a bit embarrassed.

878
01:11:37,084 --> 01:11:39,503
How can you say that between us?

879
01:11:40,504 --> 01:11:42,756
If it weren't for you,

880
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:45,968
I'd be dead already.

881
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:50,723
For now, eat and get some rest.

882
01:12:01,942 --> 01:12:03,152
Hey, Chang.

883
01:12:03,235 --> 01:12:06,196
Stop the work and send everyone home.

884
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:11,618
<i>Don't worry. It's safe here.</i>

885
01:12:12,953 --> 01:12:15,039
But what will you do with this?

886
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:22,838
Anyway, I've secured a way out.

887
01:12:22,921 --> 01:12:24,298
It's through Vietnam,

888
01:12:24,381 --> 01:12:28,135
but there's no time.
We should leave the country by today.

889
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:30,596
Sure, go ahead.

890
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:32,306
What?

891
01:12:32,389 --> 01:12:34,850
You're the only one of us with a family.

892
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:38,937
Boss, after all this time,

893
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:42,066
what do you take me for?

894
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:50,824
If we're not all leaving,
I'll prepare the next operation.

895
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:57,956
Sir, what do we do with that prosecutor?

896
01:12:59,666 --> 01:13:01,001
What do you guys want?

897
01:13:03,504 --> 01:13:05,798
According to the manual,
we should've dumped him already.

898
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:50,300
Can you hear me?

899
01:15:07,252 --> 01:15:11,173
We confirmed that they're currently
inside the Japanese consulate.

900
01:15:11,256 --> 01:15:15,594
And aside from consulate vehicles,
no cars have left the premises.

901
01:15:16,094 --> 01:15:18,347
So we hit them when they come out?

902
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:19,306
Yes,

903
01:15:19,806 --> 01:15:23,852
a Japanese cargo ship
is anchored at the Port of Dalian,

904
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:27,314
so I expect they'll try to move
Moon Ju-yeon by ship.

905
01:15:27,397 --> 01:15:30,067
I picked three points

906
01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:32,277
along the road from Shenyang to Dailan.

907
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:34,905
So the safest place to intercept them--

908
01:15:34,988 --> 01:15:36,323
Not there.

909
01:15:36,907 --> 01:15:38,534
Wherever we intercept them,

910
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:41,954
the timing will be difficult
because we're outnumbered,

911
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:43,664
and if we lose them,

912
01:15:44,164 --> 01:15:45,582
it's game over.

913
01:15:46,166 --> 01:15:47,292
So forget all this.

914
01:15:49,461 --> 01:15:50,754
Let's just break in.

915
01:15:51,255 --> 01:15:52,089
What?

916
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:55,467
We'll walk right in.

917
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:04,560
Now all I can do is laugh.

918
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:09,147
Break into the Japanese consulate?

919
01:16:10,857 --> 01:16:14,069
That's Japanese land.
It's a clear violation.

920
01:16:14,152 --> 01:16:16,446
They set our consulate on fire.

921
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:20,242
CASUALTIES AT THE KOREAN CONSULATE GENERAL

922
01:16:20,325 --> 01:16:21,368
<i>Four years ago,</i>

923
01:16:21,451 --> 01:16:24,871
<i>the two Koreas were planning</i>
<i>secret working-level talks in Hong Kong.</i>

924
01:16:25,455 --> 01:16:28,750
<i>Japan has long tried to block</i>
<i>cooperation between North and South.</i>

925
01:16:30,043 --> 01:16:33,839
<i>Because they think</i>
<i>a unified Korea would be a threat to them.</i>

926
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:38,218
<i>In the end, the talks never happened.</i>

927
01:16:39,678 --> 01:16:42,347
<i>Three of our team died, and the other one</i>

928
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:43,807
<i>I killed myself.</i>

929
01:16:44,891 --> 01:16:48,937
<i>Because he was a mole</i>
<i>helping their operation.</i>

930
01:16:51,982 --> 01:16:52,983
Moon Byung-uk was

931
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:56,069
a mole for the Japanese.

932
01:16:57,154 --> 01:17:00,991
He requested asylum
in return for secret information.

933
01:17:01,491 --> 01:17:03,910
That's why they killed him.

934
01:17:03,994 --> 01:17:06,079
Then why'd they kidnap his daughter?

935
01:17:06,163 --> 01:17:09,333
It means she has the information
we were going to receive.

936
01:17:09,416 --> 01:17:12,794
Once they get that info,
she's as good as dead.

937
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:16,465
Before that happens,
we need to get her back.

938
01:17:18,383 --> 01:17:20,344
Do you get the situation now?

939
01:17:28,727 --> 01:17:30,979
Someone's coming from HQ.

940
01:17:33,231 --> 01:17:35,984
They called all of us in.  What do we do?

941
01:17:36,568 --> 01:17:39,112
If they get involved,
things will get too complicated.

942
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:42,908
You go and stall them until we're done.

943
01:17:43,575 --> 01:17:45,243
But without me…

944
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:47,788
Just the four of you are going in?

945
01:17:47,871 --> 01:17:50,374
How is it four? It's five.

946
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:22,614
What are you doing?
You can't do that here.

947
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:24,908
Go away! Go!

948
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:28,912
Go away!

949
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:36,044
What the hell?

950
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:42,092
Get out of here!

951
01:18:43,051 --> 01:18:44,469
Are you insane?

952
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:17,127
Where is Branch Manager Ji?

953
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:19,337
I don't know.

954
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:21,882
How will you sort this out?

955
01:19:21,965 --> 01:19:22,883
I'm sorry.

956
01:19:22,966 --> 01:19:24,301
And Prosecutor Han?

957
01:19:24,801 --> 01:19:26,636
I'm not sure…

958
01:19:44,571 --> 01:19:46,239
Sorry, but this is just wrong.

959
01:19:47,073 --> 01:19:50,368
It's breaking and entering,
clearly illegal.

960
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:54,956
-By international law--
-If you're scared, just quit, you chicken.

961
01:19:55,707 --> 01:19:56,750
What?

962
01:19:56,833 --> 01:19:59,628
If we work by the law,
we can't do anything.

963
01:20:02,547 --> 01:20:04,549
There's a saying I always tell myself.

964
01:20:05,217 --> 01:20:07,302
Justice is preserved by being just.

965
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:09,513
Justice?

966
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:13,308
Is that all what justice is to you?

967
01:20:15,435 --> 01:20:19,773
Justice must be preserved
by any means possible.

968
01:20:21,399 --> 01:20:23,026
That's my idea of justice.

969
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:30,242
Okay, stand by.

970
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:33,370
Have you ever seen me wear one of those?

971
01:20:33,870 --> 01:20:35,288
Today, you should wear it.

972
01:20:35,872 --> 01:20:37,541
If it's my time, I die.

973
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:39,709
If not, I live.

974
01:20:42,462 --> 01:20:45,173
Why don't you wear two? Chicken.

975
01:20:55,642 --> 01:20:56,977
What the heck?

976
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:58,979
Rats!

977
01:20:59,062 --> 01:21:00,856
The business card.

978
01:21:00,939 --> 01:21:02,023
Where is it?

979
01:21:02,107 --> 01:21:04,776
Damn it!

980
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:11,616
-Oh, it's getting away!
-Hey, it's getting away!

981
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:16,788
I called the exterminator. They're coming.

982
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:18,456
Hold on just a minute.

983
01:21:19,165 --> 01:21:21,626
-Catch it!
-You're telling me to catch it?

984
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:23,420
Stop.

985
01:21:23,503 --> 01:21:24,337
Stop!

986
01:21:27,591 --> 01:21:29,426
Hey!

987
01:21:29,509 --> 01:21:32,262
Let them through!
I said, let them through!

988
01:21:32,929 --> 01:21:33,805
Quickly!

989
01:21:35,098 --> 01:21:37,309
This way! Come on!

990
01:21:38,852 --> 01:21:39,728
Hurry.

991
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:41,229
This way.

992
01:21:42,564 --> 01:21:44,232
They came quicker than I thought.

993
01:21:49,446 --> 01:21:50,280
Wait.

994
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:51,740
Step back, please.

995
01:21:51,823 --> 01:21:53,783
-Out of the way.
-Please hurry up.

996
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:57,495
-A gun?
-Be quiet.

997
01:21:58,538 --> 01:21:59,372
Hey!

998
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:01,458
Why are you standing there?

999
01:22:01,541 --> 01:22:03,501
Get in here, quickly!

1000
01:22:10,675 --> 01:22:11,635
Is she dead?

1001
01:22:13,345 --> 01:22:14,262
Check.

1002
01:22:39,162 --> 01:22:40,080
Out of the way!

1003
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:44,459
Move!

1004
01:22:54,886 --> 01:22:56,054
Go!

1005
01:23:14,197 --> 01:23:17,409
<i>Shenyang's underground tunnels</i>
<i>are like an anthill.</i>

1006
01:23:19,285 --> 01:23:22,247
<i>Japanese troops used them</i>
<i>for air-raid shelters in World War II.</i>

1007
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:24,207
<i>They linked all major points of the city,</i>

1008
01:23:24,290 --> 01:23:26,334
<i>so there's one</i>
<i>under the Japanese consulate.</i>

1009
01:23:27,711 --> 01:23:31,089
<i>We'll figure out where it is,</i>
<i>and strike quickly.</i>

1010
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:39,305
Over there!

1011
01:23:57,782 --> 01:23:59,075
Go after them!

1012
01:25:12,732 --> 01:25:15,485
Don't worry. She's not poisonous.

1013
01:25:17,278 --> 01:25:18,655
Get down, Lizzie.

1014
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:23,535
Get down.

1015
01:25:29,207 --> 01:25:31,042
My father worked for many years

1016
01:25:32,377 --> 01:25:34,462
as a Japanese spy.

1017
01:25:36,464 --> 01:25:39,592
And starting last year,
I began helping him in secret.

1018
01:25:44,347 --> 01:25:48,017
At first he thought the work was
for the good of North and South Korea,

1019
01:25:49,102 --> 01:25:51,813
but then he realized
that it only helped Japan.

1020
01:25:55,483 --> 01:25:56,818
They deceived him.

1021
01:25:58,695 --> 01:26:02,073
In the end he was tormented
by all the harm he had caused.

1022
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:05,618
Saying he could no longer be
Japan's marionette,

1023
01:26:07,662 --> 01:26:09,831
he decided to defect.

1024
01:26:12,584 --> 01:26:14,169
To repent his sins.

1025
01:26:17,797 --> 01:26:20,925
What was the info he had?

1026
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:24,929
A spy list.

1027
01:26:26,931 --> 01:26:31,269
So there were more spies
besides your father?

1028
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:35,690
The number of double spies
Ozawa maintains in East Asia

1029
01:26:35,773 --> 01:26:37,066
is currently 107.

1030
01:26:39,110 --> 01:26:40,195
The list contains

1031
01:26:40,278 --> 01:26:44,407
info on the mission details,
commands and reports.

1032
01:26:45,742 --> 01:26:49,495
It even includes
the source of funds for the operation.

1033
01:26:50,371 --> 01:26:52,498
My father planned to make the list public,

1034
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:55,126
and Japan is trying to stop him.

1035
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:00,924
Where is that list now?

1036
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:20,568
Please zoom in.

1037
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:28,743
At 4:39 p.m.,

1038
01:27:28,826 --> 01:27:32,413
they left their Cesco vehicle
in a parking lot near Zhongshan Square.

1039
01:27:32,497 --> 01:27:36,084
Then they got in another vehicle
and fled toward the Heping District.

1040
01:27:38,044 --> 01:27:40,880
The last signal came from District 89.

1041
01:27:40,964 --> 01:27:44,217
Activate all our antennas in Shenyang.

1042
01:28:14,455 --> 01:28:16,416
You said we'd go to a safe place.

1043
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:19,460
Right now, this may be the safest place.

1044
01:28:26,801 --> 01:28:27,969
Eleven.

1045
01:28:30,930 --> 01:28:32,432
Baby!

1046
01:28:34,642 --> 01:28:35,518
Are you insane?

1047
01:28:36,102 --> 01:28:38,021
Why come back here?

1048
01:28:39,355 --> 01:28:40,773
You want to die?

1049
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:52,994
Yaksha told us to come here.

1050
01:29:04,297 --> 01:29:05,465
Don't worry.

1051
01:29:06,049 --> 01:29:09,719
This neighborhood is so dirty and scary,

1052
01:29:09,802 --> 01:29:11,721
not even the cops come.

1053
01:29:11,804 --> 01:29:14,891
If anyone turns up,
I'll tell you right away.

1054
01:29:14,974 --> 01:29:16,059
Thanks.

1055
01:29:18,686 --> 01:29:19,729
What's your name?

1056
01:29:22,482 --> 01:29:23,316
Nike.

1057
01:29:24,984 --> 01:29:25,902
Nike?

1058
01:29:30,114 --> 01:29:32,909
Then I'm Adidas.

1059
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,418
Have a good time then.

1060
01:29:42,919 --> 01:29:46,547
These walls are really thin,

1061
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:49,509
so make sure you do it lightly,

1062
01:29:50,134 --> 01:29:51,344
gently,

1063
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:53,554
and quietly.

1064
01:29:54,347 --> 01:29:56,724
-Got it?
-All right.

1065
01:29:59,018 --> 01:30:01,396
Let me know if you need anything!

1066
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:04,774
What now?

1067
01:30:07,443 --> 01:30:08,861
We'll think of something.

1068
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:19,455
Don't worry.

1069
01:30:21,082 --> 01:30:23,501
We won't let the Japanese take you.

1070
01:30:28,381 --> 01:30:29,257
It's in Chile.

1071
01:30:31,759 --> 01:30:32,593
What?

1072
01:30:34,095 --> 01:30:35,930
My father's spy list.

1073
01:30:41,894 --> 01:30:45,148
I hid it in the database
of a university in Santiago.

1074
01:30:46,357 --> 01:30:47,191
But

1075
01:30:48,025 --> 01:30:49,527
it's not easy to reach.

1076
01:30:50,528 --> 01:30:52,488
You must access servers in several nations

1077
01:30:52,572 --> 01:30:54,866
and pass multiple firewalls.

1078
01:30:57,910 --> 01:30:59,871
Only I can do it.

1079
01:31:29,901 --> 01:31:31,402
-Han's not here yet?
-No.

1080
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:32,320
And the rest?

1081
01:31:32,403 --> 01:31:35,448
I sent them to look for a place
where he might be.

1082
01:31:37,241 --> 01:31:38,159
And the HQ people?

1083
01:31:38,242 --> 01:31:41,078
I took them for a ride
and slipped out, don't worry.

1084
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:45,416
Hello?

1085
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:48,377
<i>-It's me, Han Ji-hoon.</i>
-Where are you? I told you to come here!

1086
01:31:48,461 --> 01:31:50,087
Listen carefully.

1087
01:31:50,588 --> 01:31:54,258
The info Moon had is a list
of the spies Japan has in each country.

1088
01:31:54,842 --> 01:31:57,053
-She talked?
<i>-She told me everything, but…</i>

1089
01:31:57,136 --> 01:32:00,348
That time I took Moon Ju-yeon
and ran from you,

1090
01:32:00,431 --> 01:32:02,308
I informed HQ.

1091
01:32:02,391 --> 01:32:04,685
<i>Everything,</i>
<i>including the fact that she got away.</i>

1092
01:32:04,769 --> 01:32:05,811
Damn you.

1093
01:32:05,895 --> 01:32:09,398
Could that be<i> </i>why Japan was able
to hack into our tracking system,

1094
01:32:09,482 --> 01:32:12,193
and was always one step ahead of us?

1095
01:32:12,777 --> 01:32:14,237
Who did you talk to?

1096
01:32:15,279 --> 01:32:16,989
Director Yeom Jeong-won.

1097
01:32:17,698 --> 01:32:19,283
She's the one who sent me here.

1098
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:22,453
<i>If there's a mole inside the NIS…</i>

1099
01:32:27,083 --> 01:32:28,125
<i>Hello?</i>

1100
01:32:28,209 --> 01:32:29,085
Hello?

1101
01:32:36,801 --> 01:32:37,677
You?

1102
01:32:46,602 --> 01:32:47,562
Hello?

1103
01:32:49,605 --> 01:32:50,690
That's him!

1104
01:33:36,193 --> 01:33:37,028
Get him!

1105
01:33:50,666 --> 01:33:51,792
You're a mole?

1106
01:33:54,337 --> 01:33:55,546
For how long?

1107
01:33:56,839 --> 01:34:00,301
With mountains of debt
and a sick kid who could die any day,

1108
01:34:00,885 --> 01:34:03,804
is there anything I wouldn't do?

1109
01:34:23,282 --> 01:34:25,159
Who made you this way?

1110
01:34:27,495 --> 01:34:29,121
That NIS bitch?

1111
01:34:30,373 --> 01:34:31,624
I can't tell you.

1112
01:34:31,707 --> 01:34:32,792
If I do…

1113
01:34:36,379 --> 01:34:37,755
they'll kill my family.

1114
01:34:39,048 --> 01:34:40,633
I'm sorry, boss.

1115
01:34:58,442 --> 01:34:59,652
Greetings.

1116
01:35:02,196 --> 01:35:03,114
Prosecutor Han.

1117
01:35:05,199 --> 01:35:07,410
Sorry to startle you,

1118
01:35:08,577 --> 01:35:09,870
but to be honest,

1119
01:35:09,954 --> 01:35:13,040
I knew who you were from the beginning.

1120
01:35:13,916 --> 01:35:15,793
Instead of the street,

1121
01:35:16,627 --> 01:35:19,755
shall we go somewhere quiet
and talk over a cup of tea?

1122
01:35:37,148 --> 01:35:38,232
It's a side wound.

1123
01:35:39,859 --> 01:35:42,403
Guess he didn't intend to kill you.

1124
01:35:55,666 --> 01:35:57,418
Let's go away together.

1125
01:35:57,501 --> 01:35:58,836
Go where?

1126
01:36:00,254 --> 01:36:01,297
I feel like

1127
01:36:02,882 --> 01:36:04,884
you're going to die this time.

1128
01:36:05,468 --> 01:36:06,802
Are you scared to die?

1129
01:36:09,430 --> 01:36:10,514
You're not?

1130
01:36:10,598 --> 01:36:11,599
I'm scared

1131
01:36:12,683 --> 01:36:14,351
that I might fail again…

1132
01:36:16,228 --> 01:36:17,938
and leave things in this state.

1133
01:36:19,815 --> 01:36:21,150
That's what scares me.

1134
01:36:24,737 --> 01:36:27,072
My team risked their lives
because they trusted me.

1135
01:36:30,284 --> 01:36:31,494
<i>I need to finish</i>

1136
01:36:32,703 --> 01:36:34,038
<i>what they started.</i>

1137
01:37:55,911 --> 01:37:57,705
I've taken action,

1138
01:37:57,788 --> 01:38:00,207
but I need a bit more time.

1139
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:03,836
I'll try my best to wrap this up quickly.

1140
01:38:03,919 --> 01:38:06,088
Please don't worry.

1141
01:38:09,091 --> 01:38:10,009
Hello?

1142
01:38:11,051 --> 01:38:13,345
<i>I'm disappointed in you.</i>

1143
01:38:14,138 --> 01:38:18,559
I think it's time
to conclude our partnership.

1144
01:38:20,144 --> 01:38:21,854
What do you mean?

1145
01:38:21,937 --> 01:38:24,064
My sincere gratitude

1146
01:38:25,024 --> 01:38:27,401
for all that you've done.

1147
01:39:00,225 --> 01:39:03,979
You turned Hong into a mole
in that short time?

1148
01:39:05,397 --> 01:39:06,440
In order to kill me?

1149
01:39:09,151 --> 01:39:12,571
The fire in Hong Kong from four years ago,

1150
01:39:13,948 --> 01:39:15,449
that was your doing?

1151
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:18,953
What are you talking about?

1152
01:39:24,166 --> 01:39:25,751
I had no choice.

1153
01:39:25,834 --> 01:39:29,129
Sure, all those moles had no choice.

1154
01:39:31,882 --> 01:39:32,967
Where's Ozawa?

1155
01:39:35,260 --> 01:39:37,429
Fukuyama Chemicals.

1156
01:39:37,513 --> 01:39:39,682
He's headed to their China factory.

1157
01:39:40,432 --> 01:39:41,684
Why there?

1158
01:39:42,267 --> 01:39:44,019
I don't know.

1159
01:39:46,271 --> 01:39:47,189
It's true!

1160
01:39:49,441 --> 01:39:50,442
Listen to me.

1161
01:39:51,819 --> 01:39:53,529
I'll help you catch Ozawa.

1162
01:39:56,782 --> 01:39:58,075
Think about it.

1163
01:39:59,535 --> 01:40:03,497
Who else besides me can pull this off?

1164
01:40:04,832 --> 01:40:08,502
Who's going to listen
to a hoodlum like you?

1165
01:40:10,671 --> 01:40:12,381
You're finished, too.

1166
01:40:22,182 --> 01:40:23,267
Sir.

1167
01:40:26,770 --> 01:40:28,856
<i>-It's me.</i>
-What is it?

1168
01:40:28,939 --> 01:40:30,399
Han came here.

1169
01:40:30,482 --> 01:40:31,817
Where is he now?

1170
01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:35,195
I don't know.
He just left a message and left.

1171
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:37,406
<i>He wants to meet you.</i>

1172
01:40:52,504 --> 01:40:53,881
Are you really alone?

1173
01:40:53,964 --> 01:40:55,632
The team isn't hiding nearby?

1174
01:40:55,716 --> 01:40:57,301
What are you so scared of?

1175
01:40:57,384 --> 01:40:59,386
I can't trust anyone now.

1176
01:40:59,470 --> 01:41:00,804
Where's Moon Ju-yeon?

1177
01:41:09,772 --> 01:41:10,773
What will you do?

1178
01:41:10,856 --> 01:41:13,901
First, we all need to leave Shenyang.

1179
01:41:13,984 --> 01:41:15,235
And get that list.

1180
01:41:15,903 --> 01:41:16,862
Come on.

1181
01:41:17,404 --> 01:41:20,157
Hang around here,
and you'll end up in jail.

1182
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:23,452
Yaksha.

1183
01:41:26,747 --> 01:41:28,707
<i>Go and kill Yaksha.</i>

1184
01:41:29,249 --> 01:41:31,460
<i>Then bring Moon Ju-yeon to me.</i>

1185
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:37,716
I hear your mom and sister run
a restaurant near Suwon City Hall?

1186
01:41:40,010 --> 01:41:41,720
If you don’t do as told,

1187
01:41:41,804 --> 01:41:43,847
after midnight,

1188
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:47,267
a one-kilometer ring of fire will burn

1189
01:41:48,268 --> 01:41:49,978
around Suwon City Hall.

1190
01:42:08,664 --> 01:42:09,665
Get in.

1191
01:42:15,087 --> 01:42:16,338
Get in for now.

1192
01:42:44,449 --> 01:42:47,452
TO THE FUTURE
WITH REVOLUTIONARY TECHNOLOGY

1193
01:43:11,643 --> 01:43:14,897
I knew you could do it. Very impressive.

1194
01:43:15,772 --> 01:43:19,109
Now, we've become friends.

1195
01:44:07,407 --> 01:44:09,243
Hey, who are you?

1196
01:44:15,457 --> 01:44:17,501
Emergency in Zone A!

1197
01:44:17,584 --> 01:44:19,920
Zone A!

1198
01:44:20,003 --> 01:44:23,006
There's an intruder! Send security!

1199
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:24,049
Hurry!

1200
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:26,260
There he is.

1201
01:44:29,179 --> 01:44:30,013
Freeze!

1202
01:44:32,224 --> 01:44:33,183
Hands up!

1203
01:45:23,692 --> 01:45:24,943
Stop!

1204
01:45:29,323 --> 01:45:30,949
She went down!

1205
01:45:50,886 --> 01:45:51,887
Up there!

1206
01:46:52,447 --> 01:46:53,573
Everything going well?

1207
01:46:53,657 --> 01:46:55,158
You're alive.

1208
01:46:55,242 --> 01:46:58,703
Sure. I don't die so easily.

1209
01:47:03,959 --> 01:47:07,212
<i>He said he would shoot you,</i>
<i>but you should trust him.</i>

1210
01:47:09,172 --> 01:47:11,341
Have you ever seen me wear one of those?

1211
01:47:13,468 --> 01:47:17,264
-If it's my time, I die. If not, I live.
-If it's my time, I die. If not, I live.

1212
01:47:17,347 --> 01:47:18,557
<i>He told me to say that.</i>

1213
01:47:23,854 --> 01:47:24,855
That hurts.

1214
01:47:25,689 --> 01:47:27,399
Did any pierce through?

1215
01:47:28,733 --> 01:47:29,734
Let me look.

1216
01:47:31,319 --> 01:47:34,865
That asshole.
Did he need to shoot so many?

1217
01:47:36,950 --> 01:47:38,452
Prosecutor Han.

1218
01:47:39,703 --> 01:47:41,413
You deceived me?

1219
01:47:41,496 --> 01:47:44,749
Compared to your methods,
this is pretty tame.

1220
01:47:46,209 --> 01:47:49,212
After all the stunts you've pulled,

1221
01:47:49,796 --> 01:47:51,673
we decided to try one, too.

1222
01:47:52,632 --> 01:47:53,550
So what?

1223
01:48:29,836 --> 01:48:32,464
Look at those moles. Oodles of them.

1224
01:48:33,965 --> 01:48:36,176
Are these all your trainees?

1225
01:48:37,093 --> 01:48:40,096
I like to think of them as my artworks.

1226
01:48:40,180 --> 01:48:41,348
Artworks, my ass.

1227
01:48:55,779 --> 01:48:57,197
It's a shame,

1228
01:48:58,073 --> 01:49:00,116
but that's all I can show you today.

1229
01:49:08,750 --> 01:49:11,378
<i>Control room, respond!</i>
<i>The exit in Zone C has collapsed!</i>

1230
01:49:11,461 --> 01:49:13,797
<i>Open the exit in Zone D!</i>

1231
01:49:15,298 --> 01:49:17,092
<i>Control room, respond!</i>

1232
01:49:17,175 --> 01:49:19,928
You want to delete it? It's not up to you.

1233
01:49:22,514 --> 01:49:23,557
You two, beat it.

1234
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:24,891
Let's go together.

1235
01:49:24,975 --> 01:49:25,976
It's dangerous here.

1236
01:49:27,894 --> 01:49:28,853
I said, go.

1237
01:49:30,188 --> 01:49:32,315
I'm going to skin this jerk alive today.

1238
01:49:58,341 --> 01:49:59,467
Hey.

1239
01:51:02,530 --> 01:51:05,492
-Where's Yaksha?
-Still inside. With him.

1240
01:51:12,832 --> 01:51:15,418
The thought of that list getting out,

1241
01:51:16,211 --> 01:51:17,879
does it make you tremble?

1242
01:51:24,928 --> 01:51:25,970
-No.
-Move!

1243
01:51:26,054 --> 01:51:28,682
-We'll all die this way.
-Move, there's no time.

1244
01:51:28,765 --> 01:51:30,058
Listen to me!

1245
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:34,020
- It's his order!
- No!

1246
01:51:34,104 --> 01:51:35,397
Let go!

1247
01:51:38,066 --> 01:51:38,983
Damn it.

1248
01:52:30,034 --> 01:52:32,036
Your mission has finished.

1249
01:52:33,121 --> 01:52:35,290
You can go now, Yaksha.

1250
01:52:41,212 --> 01:52:42,255
Drop the gun!

1251
01:52:43,715 --> 01:52:44,883
Prosecutor Han.

1252
01:52:44,966 --> 01:52:48,136
You keep disappointing me.

1253
01:52:48,219 --> 01:52:49,345
Shoot.

1254
01:52:50,889 --> 01:52:52,307
That's right.

1255
01:52:52,390 --> 01:52:53,683
Shoot.

1256
01:52:54,559 --> 01:52:58,897
Shall we bet on who's faster?

1257
01:53:00,607 --> 01:53:01,858
One.

1258
01:53:02,484 --> 01:53:03,485
Two.

1259
01:53:45,819 --> 01:53:46,861
What's going on?

1260
01:53:47,362 --> 01:53:51,074
If anyone attempts to delete the file,

1261
01:53:51,157 --> 01:53:53,743
it's programmed to send it out.

1262
01:53:55,370 --> 01:53:57,747
The intelligence services

1263
01:53:57,831 --> 01:54:00,416
of each country where your moles work

1264
01:54:00,500 --> 01:54:02,502
are receiving the list right now.

1265
01:54:08,758 --> 01:54:11,094
No! Damn it!

1266
01:54:26,359 --> 01:54:27,735
Damn it!

1267
01:55:52,820 --> 01:55:54,364
You're the one who's finished.

1268
01:56:49,585 --> 01:56:52,880
<i>Hey, Nike.</i>
<i>Pull it together and listen carefully.</i>

1269
01:56:53,881 --> 01:56:56,134
Whether you have to crawl out or jump,

1270
01:56:56,801 --> 01:57:00,013
make it out of here alive.

1271
01:57:02,098 --> 01:57:04,183
Then go to the old man's liquor factory.

1272
01:57:06,728 --> 01:57:07,979
Take that thing in,

1273
01:57:08,980 --> 01:57:12,817
and prosecute her
within the fullest extent of the law.

1274
01:57:13,985 --> 01:57:15,111
What do you mean?

1275
01:57:15,194 --> 01:57:18,698
You clean things up. You do it.

1276
01:57:20,158 --> 01:57:21,701
I can't trust anyone else.

1277
01:57:23,661 --> 01:57:24,495
You do it.

1278
01:58:04,368 --> 01:58:07,580
<i>A director at South Korea's</i>
<i>National Intelligence Service</i>

1279
01:58:07,663 --> 01:58:09,874
<i>who's been spying for Japan</i>
<i>has been arrested…</i>

1280
01:58:09,957 --> 01:58:11,626
<i>Members of the press</i>

01:58:14,045 --> 01:58:17,423
<i>Companies like Yamakawa and Nishiba,</i>
<i>with developments based on war crimes…</i>

1283
01:58:17,507 --> 01:58:21,094
<i>They have been regularly taking</i>
<i>hundreds of millions worth of bribes…</i>

1284
01:58:21,177 --> 01:58:22,261
ONE YEAR LATER, SEOUL

1285
01:58:22,345 --> 01:58:25,264
<i>In particular, the news</i>
<i>that Sang-in Group's Japan branch</i>

1286
01:58:25,348 --> 01:58:27,100
<i>also took part in this bribery</i>

1287

<i>has sent shock waves throughout Korea.</i>

1288
01:58:29,102 --> 01:58:31,729
-Do you admit to the charges?
-Did you order them yourself?

1289
01:58:31,813 --> 01:58:33,106
Please say something!

1290
01:58:39,487 --> 01:58:40,780
Welcome.

1291
01:58:44,826 --> 01:58:47,370
You spilled hot sauce on your shirt.

1292
01:59:01,551 --> 01:59:04,053
<i>At 4 p.m. today,</i>
<i>Seoul Central District Court</i>

1293

<i>declared Chairman Lee guilty</i>
<i>and sent him to prison.</i>

1294
01:59:08,349 --> 01:59:11,394

1296
01:59:15,565 --> 01:59:16,816
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

1297
01:59:16,899 --> 01:59:18,276
<i>…for bribery.</i>

1298
01:59:18,359 --> 01:59:22,405
<i>Meanwhile, a trial will open soon</i>

01:59:24,782 --> 01:59:25,950
PROSECUTOR HAN JI-HOON

1301
01:59:26,033 --> 01:59:29,162
<i>…which is expected</i>
<i>to lengthen Lee's sentence.</i>

1302
01:59:31,998 --> 01:59:33,875
That seemingly impregnable fortress

1303
01:59:33,958 --> 01:59:37,879
collapsed in the blink of an eye
after a few confessions.

1304
01:59:37,962 --> 01:59:39,088
Hello.

1305
01:59:39,672 --> 01:59:41,424
How should I put this?

1306
01:59:41,507 --> 01:59:45,887
Like a sudden blow
to the back of the head.

1307
01:59:46,387 --> 01:59:47,847
That wasn't your style.

1308
01:59:49,599 --> 01:59:50,516
You've changed.

1309
01:59:53,769 --> 01:59:54,645
Someone told me.

1310
01:59:55,605 --> 01:59:58,441
Justice must be preserved

1311
01:59:59,525 --> 02:00:01,235
by any means necessary.

1312
02:00:04,822 --> 02:00:05,698
Hello?

1313
02:00:05,781 --> 02:00:08,409
<i>Is this Prosecutor Han Ji-hoon?</i>

1314
02:00:08,910 --> 02:00:11,704
Yes, it is. Who's speaking?

1315
02:00:13,789 --> 02:00:14,957
<i>Hey, Nike!</i>

1316
02:00:16,792 --> 02:00:18,002
It's me, Yaksha.

1317
02:00:18,085 --> 02:00:19,128
What happened?

1318
02:00:19,962 --> 02:00:21,631
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1319
02:00:21,714 --> 02:00:23,424
<i>You think I'd die?</i>

1320
02:00:24,008 --> 02:00:25,426
<i>I don't die so easily.</i>

1321
02:00:26,427 --> 02:00:27,511
Where are you now?

1322
02:00:27,595 --> 02:00:30,181
Where else? Back on the battlefield.

1323
02:00:31,599 --> 02:00:33,017
<i>I need you here now.</i>

1324
02:00:34,435 --> 02:00:36,520
<i>I found a real evil dude.</i>

1325
02:00:36,604 --> 02:00:41,108
<i>Someone who chews</i>
<i>and spits out the law.</i>

1326
02:00:41,692 --> 02:00:43,861
<i>I think I'll need your help on this.</i>

1327
02:00:44,362 --> 02:00:45,821
Drag me into the sewer again?

1328
02:00:45,905 --> 02:00:48,199
It's pretty filthy this time.

1329
02:00:48,282 --> 02:00:49,742
Keep your phone on.

1330
02:01:27,780 --> 02:01:29,156
Please follow me, everyone.

1331
02:01:30,491 --> 02:01:31,659
This way.

1332
02:01:31,742 --> 02:01:33,327
Go on inside.
