NIGHT OF THE UNDEAD

00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:11.958
DIRECTED BY
SHIN JUNG-WON

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.433
<i>Cleaning mode on.</i>

00:02:27.228 --> 00:02:28.810
Marin, show me the recipe.

00:02:29.767 --> 00:02:31.390
<i>Here’s the recipe.</i>

00:02:42.046 --> 00:02:44.086
Honey, breakfast.

00:02:44.086 --> 00:02:46.500
Delicious soup is ready for you.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.371
Just a bit more…

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.868
You need breakfast
for an energetic day.

00:02:53.868 --> 00:02:56.074
Wakey wakey.

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:58.530
Wake up!

00:03:00.403 --> 00:03:01.652
All right!

00:03:15.013 --> 00:03:15.721
Is it not good?

00:03:18.843 --> 00:03:20.591
It’s just amazing!

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:22.797
Your cooking is improving!

00:03:24.806 --> 00:03:26.138
My Bebe is the best.

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:32.912
Don’t you have a reunion today?

00:03:32.912 --> 00:03:34.202
- Yeah.
- You’ll be late?

00:03:34.577 --> 00:03:36.492
I don’t think it’d end with
just a dinner.

00:03:37.324 --> 00:03:39.406
It’s the first gathering
since we got married.

00:03:39.406 --> 00:03:39.988
Right,

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:43.568
what about your dinner?

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.856
I gotta work late
at the office anyway.

00:03:47.273 --> 00:03:48.105
I can eat it there.

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:50.186
You’re being suspicious.

00:03:51.061 --> 00:03:52.601
You’re working late
frequently lately.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.347
You sure you’re working?

00:04:03.165 --> 00:04:03.998
What’s wrong?

00:04:07.411 --> 00:04:08.993
You’re more tempting than food.

00:04:11.574 --> 00:04:12.115
Marin!

00:04:12.365 --> 00:04:13.780
Back to sleep mode!

00:04:14.113 --> 00:04:16.818
<i>Sleep mode on… again.</i>

00:04:52.408 --> 00:04:53.657
It’s been so long.

00:04:53.781 --> 00:04:55.779
- How long has it been?
- Too long.

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:16.675
Oh no…

00:05:51.244 --> 00:05:52.659
Isn’t that Yang-sun?

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:55.198
I heard she’s still trying to
make it as an actress.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.821
She starred in a TV show recently.

00:05:57.821 --> 00:06:00.360
I saw just the back of her head.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.692
Be quiet, here she comes.

00:06:04.231 --> 00:06:07.644
Why are you quiet
all of sudden?

00:06:08.144 --> 00:06:09.559
Were you badmouthing me?

00:06:09.892 --> 00:06:11.182
Of course not.

00:06:11.182 --> 00:06:13.597
You’re not hurt, are you?

00:06:13.805 --> 00:06:17.634
Ladies, I even shot
an action movie recently.

00:06:20.007 --> 00:06:23.420
Look at your talk,
not a country gal anymore.

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:26.542
Oh yeah, I heard you got married.

00:06:27.583 --> 00:06:28.332
Yeah...

00:06:28.665 --> 00:06:32.994
In-laws are in the States,
so we had a private ceremony

00:06:32.994 --> 00:06:35.117
at a church by ourselves.

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:40.070
Okay, I’ll let that pass,
but how did you meet?

00:06:39.426 --> 00:06:43.047
He sounds like a catch,
you fox…

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.941
He was working
after graduating from Stanford,

00:06:43.713 --> 00:06:46.211
Stanford? That’s amazing.

00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:47.355
and came to Korea on a trip
and met me here.

00:06:46.211 --> 00:06:47.251
Is it?

00:06:47.709 --> 00:06:50.914
Guys like him are 100% cheaters.

00:06:47.771 --> 00:06:49.394
He owns a pharma company.

00:06:50.914 --> 00:06:52.330
Stop it!

00:06:53.453 --> 00:06:56.575
No way,
my hubby’s not like that.

00:06:57.525 --> 00:07:00.938
Are you seeing anyone?

00:07:01.188 --> 00:07:02.145
I sure am.

00:07:02.145 --> 00:07:04.518
Who is he?
What does he do?

00:07:06.141 --> 00:07:07.556
A fotographer-arist.

00:07:09.887 --> 00:07:11.844
Yeah? That’s amazing.

00:07:11.844 --> 00:07:15.923
He originally did a Ph.D.
on astronomy here,

00:07:15.923 --> 00:07:18.420
but he had the urge
to take photos,

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.460
so he studied at
Université Paris 8.

00:07:21.126 --> 00:07:22.125
By golly!

00:07:25.705 --> 00:07:27.078
Then…

00:07:27.661 --> 00:07:33.738
he could photograph you
like those celebrities.

00:07:33.946 --> 00:07:38.650
What’s the use, he travels
all over the world for art.

00:07:40.065 --> 00:07:42.646
He flew out to Idaly today too.

00:07:43.562 --> 00:07:46.309
He asked me to join him,
but what’s the point?

00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:50.513
He’ll be up all night
photographing the stars in the sky,

00:07:51.138 --> 00:07:53.094
ignoring the real star
beside him.

00:07:54.384 --> 00:07:58.006
You should’ve gone
to Italy, I’m so jealous…

00:08:00.045 --> 00:08:04.458
By the way, Sera isn’t here again?

00:08:04.541 --> 00:08:07.912
I heard she went to jail
for killing her husband.

00:08:08.204 --> 00:08:09.619
Really? Her husband?

00:08:10.327 --> 00:08:11.367
<i>I think he cheated.
</i>

00:08:11.367 --> 00:08:13.823
<i>I heard she left Korea
with a rich Chinese.
</i>

00:08:13.823 --> 00:08:16.362
<i>Could he be the one
whom she chopped up?</i>

00:08:16.446 --> 00:08:19.068
Chopped up?
No way.

00:08:21.024 --> 00:08:24.271
I heard she got special training
to infiltrate the North.

00:08:24.729 --> 00:08:26.144
<i>Sera: Sorry, I got stuck at work.
</i>

00:08:27.102 --> 00:08:29.183
She’s fierce as always.

00:08:30.607 --> 00:08:31.190
Oh yeah!

00:08:31.856 --> 00:08:35.893
You were best friends with her,
aren’t you in touch?

00:08:36.101 --> 00:08:36.809
That’s right.

00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:38.141
What?

00:08:37.744 --> 00:08:38.702
<i>- Call you later.
- OK.</i>

00:08:39.931 --> 00:08:42.303
Well, we sometimes…

00:09:23.737 --> 00:09:27.358
Baby, you got a call.

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:29.856
Honey?

00:09:33.644 --> 00:09:35.309
Oh my, so cute…

00:09:39.305 --> 00:09:40.803
I love you…

00:09:42.926 --> 00:09:44.966
I love you too.

00:10:12.688 --> 00:10:14.436
<i>You’re not answering.
Wife’s back already?</i>

00:10:14.436 --> 00:10:16.101
<i>When do we leave on Friday?
I can’t wait!</i>

00:10:28.006 --> 00:10:30.504
What are you doing on Friday?

00:10:34.666 --> 00:10:36.165
Friday? Why?

00:10:36.706 --> 00:10:38.745
There’s a couple’s get-together.

00:10:42.325 --> 00:10:44.032
I got a funeral to attend.

00:10:53.023 --> 00:10:56.228
He’s in ICU, but the doctor said
he’ll die on Friday.

00:10:58.226 --> 00:11:00.266
He’s a really good friend.

00:11:01.431 --> 00:11:04.595
We played basketball
when we were in Stanford.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:10.047
You know how accurate
doctors are nowadays.

00:11:12.545 --> 00:11:13.835
He’ll die on Friday.

00:11:27.488 --> 00:11:28.904
Want some help?

00:11:40.392 --> 00:11:41.474
<i>Cheating husband
</i>

00:11:49.092 --> 00:11:51.714
<i>Does he frequently work late?
Come in for consultation – Dr. Jang</i>

00:11:51.714 --> 00:11:53.504
I gotta work late
at the office anyway.

00:11:53.962 --> 00:11:55.127
I can eat it there.

00:12:37.044 --> 00:12:40.748
<i>Mystery Research Lab </i>

00:12:57.056 --> 00:12:59.054
Mrs. Park So-hee,
you may go inside.

00:13:16.912 --> 00:13:17.703
Welcome.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.859
Please sit over here.

00:13:30.099 --> 00:13:32.139
<i>Mystery Research Lab
Dr. Jang
</i>

00:13:32.139 --> 00:13:35.469
<i>We don’t judge,
we’ll just solve your case. </i>

00:13:35.669 --> 00:13:38.042
You must’ve studied abroad.

00:13:38.042 --> 00:13:39.540
For a bit in France.

00:13:39.956 --> 00:13:41.621
What brings you here?

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:47.074
I saw it on a blog that
you do marriage counseling,

00:13:47.074 --> 00:13:49.405
and the ratings were great too.

00:13:49.405 --> 00:13:52.069
Yes, we can help with
anything but murder.

00:13:52.777 --> 00:13:56.482
So, you came here
because of your husband?

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.560
I understand your feelings.

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:05.015
Everyone comes here
with such uneasiness.

00:14:05.264 --> 00:14:09.094
Infidelity must be confirmed
to get to the next step.

00:14:09.094 --> 00:14:13.298
If it’s not, that’s good,
but if it is, we need to resolve it.

00:14:15.379 --> 00:14:17.502
It’s my first time
at a place like this.

00:14:18.168 --> 00:14:20.749
Everyone’s nervous at first,
no need to be embarrassed.

00:14:20.749 --> 00:14:25.203
50% of my clients are here
because of their cheating husbands.

00:14:25.494 --> 00:14:27.367
And the remaining 50%?

00:14:27.742 --> 00:14:30.031
Cheating wives, of course.

00:14:36.608 --> 00:14:38.939
<i>I think I judged too recklessly.</i>

00:14:39.272 --> 00:14:40.479
<i>My apologies.
</i>

00:14:44.226 --> 00:14:46.515
Seed of doubt
has been planted.

00:14:46.515 --> 00:14:49.803
Don’t you want to find out
if your doubt is correct?

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.660
I’ll now debrief
his whereabouts.

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:11.490
April 15, he left home
at 5:30 AM.

00:15:12.364 --> 00:15:15.319
He arrived at a driving range
at 6 AM to play golf.

00:15:18.025 --> 00:15:18.858
Nice shot!

00:15:36.964 --> 00:15:41.002
<i>He drank hard liquor
at the lounge at 9:06 AM.</i>

00:15:41.585 --> 00:15:45.331
<i>He drank 41 bottles by himself.</i>

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.992
Then he drove to
an Itaewon club.

00:15:54.405 --> 00:15:55.529
Club.

00:16:06.435 --> 00:16:09.057
<i>The stamp you saw
must’ve been from there.</i>

00:16:09.349 --> 00:16:11.805
<i>He looked like a VIP client.</i>

00:16:11.805 --> 00:16:13.261
<i>He wasn’t even patted down.</i>

00:16:22.669 --> 00:16:26.373
<i>I wasn’t allowed in
for not being a member.
</i>

00:16:27.247 --> 00:16:28.538
Hold on!

00:16:32.451 --> 00:16:33.741
Anyway.

00:16:33.907 --> 00:16:37.654
He left there with a 20-something
girl and went to a hotel.

00:16:42.982 --> 00:16:45.438
<i>She turned out to be
23 years old.
</i>

00:16:46.187 --> 00:16:49.017
<i>In other words,
a cradle robber.</i>

00:16:49.017 --> 00:16:50.016
Legit cradle robber.

00:16:50.974 --> 00:16:53.638
<i>He left the hotel
and by 4:07 PM,
</i>

00:16:53.638 --> 00:16:56.302
<i>he arrived at a gym in Banpo.
</i>

00:17:02.462 --> 00:17:06.458
<i>He worked out for 2 hours
without a second of rest,</i>

00:17:06.458 --> 00:17:09.663
<i>and did bench press
and hip thrust.
</i>

00:17:28.311 --> 00:17:33.681
He moved to Banpo Rivershore
with a girl he met there.

00:17:57.241 --> 00:18:01.570
<i>Lastly, at 11:45 PM,
he arrived at a Majang gas station.
</i>

00:18:05.441 --> 00:18:12.476
Something very strange
happened there…

00:18:12.476 --> 00:18:14.432
Did he do something again there?

00:18:16.263 --> 00:18:18.261
- Don’t be startled.
- Which woman was it?

00:18:22.216 --> 00:18:26.170
He drank over
$30 worth of gasoline.

00:18:27.408 --> 00:18:27.942
Huh?

00:18:29.251 --> 00:18:30.208
He drank what?

00:18:31.748 --> 00:18:33.455
He drank gasoline.

00:18:33.746 --> 00:18:37.201
I’m only getting started,
don’t be shocked.

00:18:37.701 --> 00:18:41.905
He drove to Yeoksam and
rendezvoused with girl #3

00:18:42.529 --> 00:18:43.570
<i>at 1:05 AM.</i>

00:18:44.652 --> 00:18:46.817
<i>His target was none other than…</i>

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.939
your high school friend.

00:18:53.851 --> 00:18:54.975
Kyung-hee?

00:18:55.142 --> 00:18:55.974
Even more startling is…

00:18:56.391 --> 00:18:57.556
What’s that?

00:18:57.556 --> 00:19:00.678
<i>he hit on the bartender
at the same time.</i>

00:19:00.928 --> 00:19:01.677
Cheers.

00:19:02.052 --> 00:19:07.921
<i>For 21 straight hours
until 2:31 AM,
</i>

00:19:07.921 --> 00:19:11.167
he travelled across
all parts of Seoul,

00:19:11.167 --> 00:19:15.996
and had rendezvous
with numerous girls…

00:19:15.996 --> 00:19:17.703
I’ve heard enough…

00:19:18.202 --> 00:19:19.284
Thank you…

00:19:19.284 --> 00:19:20.949
One moment.

00:19:23.114 --> 00:19:27.027
There is something
you really need to know.

00:19:29.774 --> 00:19:35.768
Your husband has numerous
marriage certificates.

00:19:38.182 --> 00:19:39.764
Marriage certificates?

00:19:40.055 --> 00:19:44.010
I even doubted myself
and checked and double checked,

00:19:45.175 --> 00:19:48.547
triple checked
and quadruple checked…

00:19:49.962 --> 00:19:51.419
You’re the fourth marriage.

00:19:55.415 --> 00:19:56.206
What?

00:19:57.454 --> 00:20:01.117
I’m sure you’re in shock,
this will do for now.

00:20:24.494 --> 00:20:25.993
Have you collected some samples?

00:20:26.326 --> 00:20:27.824
We’re running low.

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:29.656
I’m sorry.

00:20:30.155 --> 00:20:31.904
He hasn’t collected
anything in a week.

00:20:32.029 --> 00:20:33.943
It’s a dry season…

00:20:34.776 --> 00:20:36.316
You’ve aged rapidly.

00:20:37.481 --> 00:20:38.356
Stupid punk…

00:20:41.186 --> 00:20:42.601
Come here.

00:20:44.641 --> 00:20:48.637
You gotta slick your hair,
like this, you idiot…

00:20:50.801 --> 00:20:53.674
Be cool when you’re in public.

00:20:56.296 --> 00:20:56.920
Okay.

00:21:34.924 --> 00:21:36.506
Sera…

00:21:47.994 --> 00:21:49.576
I gave him everything,

00:21:51.532 --> 00:21:52.781
but it was all a lie…

00:22:00.024 --> 00:22:00.981
Son of a bitch…

00:22:03.021 --> 00:22:05.061
I am so gonna kill him.

00:22:11.721 --> 00:22:14.010
Perfect man doesn’t exist.

00:22:14.842 --> 00:22:18.381
Most men cheat on their wives.

00:22:19.171 --> 00:22:21.419
All men are the same.

00:22:22.301 --> 00:22:23.925
I’m his fourth wife!

00:22:28.462 --> 00:22:30.752
Didn’t you date like 10 guys?

00:22:31.168 --> 00:22:32.500
No way!

00:22:33.249 --> 00:22:34.623
They were chasing after me,

00:22:35.039 --> 00:22:36.829
I didn’t date them all!

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.536
You’re the one
who married three times.

00:22:38.869 --> 00:22:40.367
Or was it four divorces?

00:22:44.197 --> 00:22:44.946
Sorry.

00:22:44.946 --> 00:22:48.692
Stop the nonsense
and head home, it’s late.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.273
He even met Kyung-hee!

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:54.769
Kyung-hee?

00:22:54.853 --> 00:22:56.892
How could this happen?

00:22:57.808 --> 00:23:00.972
Fucking… trashes…

00:23:06.924 --> 00:23:08.964
- Sera.
- Yeah?

00:23:09.213 --> 00:23:11.669
- Is the rumor true?
- What?

00:23:13.085 --> 00:23:16.040
That I killed my ex-husbands?

00:23:19.994 --> 00:23:20.868
Chopped up.

00:23:23.824 --> 00:23:25.281
You believe that?

00:23:28.694 --> 00:23:30.775
Right? It can’t be true.

00:23:33.106 --> 00:23:38.934
But they deserved to die,
no better than animals…

00:23:44.886 --> 00:23:48.341
He may not be
a normal human being.

00:23:50.381 --> 00:23:52.628
I don’t really understand…

00:23:52.961 --> 00:23:54.876
Allow me to be frank.

00:23:56.208 --> 00:23:58.164
In our field…

00:23:58.955 --> 00:24:01.827
his kind is known as “Unbreakable”.

00:24:03.451 --> 00:24:05.324
Breaking what?

00:24:08.446 --> 00:24:09.944
“Unbreakable”.

00:24:10.943 --> 00:24:14.648
It hasn’t been confirmed yet,
but there are theories.

00:24:14.648 --> 00:24:18.686
It could be a new creation
or a new mutant,

00:24:18.686 --> 00:24:22.515
or an external infusion
from ancient times.

00:24:22.515 --> 00:24:25.054
I prefer the external infusion theory.

00:24:25.137 --> 00:24:26.469
External infusion?

00:24:31.506 --> 00:24:32.380
Alien.

00:24:35.918 --> 00:24:39.123
I don’t really understand…

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:41.579
I’ll come back again.

00:24:41.579 --> 00:24:43.119
Wait a minute, ma’am…

00:24:43.119 --> 00:24:44.535
One moment please…

00:24:45.284 --> 00:24:48.780
Ma’am, our retainer…

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:49.946
- Hold on a minute!
- Retainer…

00:24:49.946 --> 00:24:50.987
Let go of me!

00:24:55.016 --> 00:24:56.556
Are you okay?

00:24:57.805 --> 00:25:01.551
Your bag sure packs
a punch like a luxury bag.

00:25:01.759 --> 00:25:03.050
I’m sorry…

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:06.088
Anyway, I understand your feelings.

00:25:06.088 --> 00:25:07.337
You think I’m crazy, right?

00:25:07.753 --> 00:25:08.628
Yes.

00:25:09.543 --> 00:25:13.789
There were similar cases
in the past.

00:25:14.164 --> 00:25:19.658
But my clients disappeared
only a few days afterwards,

00:25:20.574 --> 00:25:24.362
or were found dead,
with no exception.

00:25:34.602 --> 00:25:37.723
Honey, I’m home.

00:25:49.711 --> 00:25:51.127
Where are you, babe?

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:03.614
<i>Extra-terrestrial Lifeform
Quarantine Center
</i>

00:26:05.196 --> 00:26:07.360
Dr. Johnson, I heard
so much about you.

00:26:16.643 --> 00:26:17.975
I'm an agent of astrophysics.

00:26:19.931 --> 00:26:22.429
This is… Dr. Jomura from Japan.

00:26:23.178 --> 00:26:24.094
I’m Dr. Jomura.

00:26:25.093 --> 00:26:26.008
Good to meet you!

00:26:27.299 --> 00:26:29.047
How come they’re all
named Jo-something?

00:26:29.755 --> 00:26:31.087
Don’t translate that!

00:26:31.087 --> 00:26:31.794
Yes, sir.

00:26:31.878 --> 00:26:34.042
Okay, let’s do this right!

00:26:39.495 --> 00:26:41.909
This is strictly
my own hypothesis,

00:26:42.534 --> 00:26:44.240
but it’s closest to reality.

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.613
Due to infertile environment
and energy depletion,

00:26:46.613 --> 00:26:49.027
aliens from other planets came here,

00:26:49.027 --> 00:26:51.566
and are living among us
by disguising like humans.

00:26:51.691 --> 00:26:55.937
They’ve evolved by
selecting dominant genes,

00:26:55.937 --> 00:26:58.101
so they’re close
to the perfect human.

00:26:58.101 --> 00:27:03.471
Any men who are 185cm tall,
fit and handsome are likely them.

00:27:03.471 --> 00:27:05.344
I’m sure there are exceptions.

00:27:05.885 --> 00:27:09.548
Actor Will Smith
may be one of them.

00:27:10.547 --> 00:27:14.294
There’s no way our government
doesn’t know about them.

00:27:14.585 --> 00:27:17.832
<i>To avoid detection,
they get married, have jobs,</i>

00:27:17.998 --> 00:27:19.788
<i>and pretend to be
ordinary humans.
</i>

00:27:20.288 --> 00:27:21.744
You look like a deer.

00:27:21.828 --> 00:27:24.991
A considerable amount of them
is estimated to be living in Seoul.

00:27:25.033 --> 00:27:28.155
Among them, Choi Man-gil,
the leader of the Unbreakable,

00:27:28.155 --> 00:27:30.028
is the most dangerous of all.

00:27:30.153 --> 00:27:35.439
Why did they invade our country,
I mean, our planet…

00:27:35.689 --> 00:27:39.602
<i>They lure women with
meticulous façades and skills…
</i>

00:27:43.473 --> 00:27:47.552
<i>Their goal is to spread fatal virus
by analyzing our DNA.</i>

00:28:05.043 --> 00:28:05.959
What do you think?

00:28:05.959 --> 00:28:09.289
Does it all make sense to you now?

00:28:10.121 --> 00:28:12.244
No, not at all.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:16.032
Then I’ll show you the truth.

00:28:49.873 --> 00:28:51.372
Do you believe me now?

00:29:21.858 --> 00:29:24.147
Where can I get
water around here?!

00:29:42.005 --> 00:29:42.671
You’re home?

00:29:44.627 --> 00:29:45.335
Yeah.

00:29:47.124 --> 00:29:48.248
Are you going somewhere?

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.078
I got some work to do.

00:29:54.242 --> 00:29:56.573
Get changed,
I’ll make you breakfast.

00:29:57.572 --> 00:29:58.738
Okay.

00:30:31.247 --> 00:30:34.702
<i>My clients were found dead,

00:30:34.702 --> 00:30:36.159

00:30:39.738 --> 00:30:41.778

00:30:41.778 --> 00:30:44.234
So-hee! Baby!

00:30:44.733 --> 00:30:48.605
So-hee! So-hee?

00:30:52.601 --> 00:30:56.347
Are you dead?
Are you?

00:31:00.343 --> 00:31:03.714
I almost died too,
eating your food.

00:31:05.163 --> 00:31:06.870

taken cooking classes?

Oh no, how is this possible?!

00:31:31.012 --> 00:31:32.511
I’m from life insurance.

00:31:32.511 --> 00:31:33.760
Could you sign this?

00:31:34.176 --> 00:31:36.299
Poor thing…

00:31:36.673 --> 00:31:37.589
So-hee…

00:31:37.756 --> 00:31:39.920
- My baby…
- I’m from the funeral home.

00:31:43.875 --> 00:31:44.915
Seasoned skate salad is extra?

00:31:44.915 --> 00:31:45.997
Yes, that’s extra.

00:31:48.412 --> 00:31:50.326
What do I do now?

00:31:50.326 --> 00:31:51.825
We got another victim.

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.319
Sera?

00:31:57.652 --> 00:31:59.068
I thought Sera was dead.

00:32:00.233 --> 00:32:01.399
Dammit…

00:32:03.563 --> 00:32:06.227
- Was it you?
- What?

00:32:06.976 --> 00:32:08.267
You killed So-hee.

00:32:08.267 --> 00:32:09.224
What are you saying…

00:32:09.224 --> 00:32:12.180
She died because of you,
son of a bitch!

00:32:14.594 --> 00:32:15.634
Sera! Stop!

00:32:16.592 --> 00:32:18.215
Kyung-hee, you calm her down…

00:32:19.422 --> 00:32:22.003
Choi Kyung-hee,
you slut!

00:32:28.497 --> 00:32:29.121
Hold on!

00:32:31.993 --> 00:32:33.283
Holy shit!

00:32:36.822 --> 00:32:38.154
The victim is back from the dead.

00:32:40.027 --> 00:32:40.901

00:32:46.187 --> 00:32:47.644
Where am I?

00:32:48.893 --> 00:32:49.850
You’re not dead?

00:32:51.349 --> 00:32:54.471
No, why are you all here?

00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:58.966
So-hee…

00:33:00.548 --> 00:33:01.921

00:33:15.283 --> 00:33:16.573
How is she, doctor?

00:33:16.906 --> 00:33:19.570
This happens once
in 10 million cases,

00:33:20.112 --> 00:33:21.527
she had an upset stomach.

00:33:21.652 --> 00:33:25.107
With some rest at home,
she’ll be fine.

- Don’t worry now.

00:34:28.252 --> 00:34:31.790
<i>Why isn’t she dying? Why!</i>

00:34:31.832 --> 00:34:34.662
<i>We have to kill her
for good this time. </i>

00:34:35.245 --> 00:34:37.076
<i>A human who won’t die…</i>

00:34:37.076 --> 00:34:39.615
<i>Rehab Traditional Pharmacy</i>

00:34:39.865 --> 00:34:43.403
She’s the first one
impervious to my poison.

00:34:43.653 --> 00:34:47.316
She’s different,
it’s weird.

00:35:01.469 --> 00:35:03.092
You sure about this one?

00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:06.464
Administer it to her neck
or thigh when she’s asleep.

00:35:06.838 --> 00:35:10.668
Cause of death will be
heart attack in the autopsy.

00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:25.429
You’re a bill short.

00:35:26.394 --> 00:35:27.560
What do you mean?

00:35:29.558 --> 00:35:30.765
It’s what you asked.

00:35:30.932 --> 00:35:33.554
I increased the fee,
price of ingredients went up.

00:35:33.554 --> 00:35:36.260
Everything goes up
except the salary.

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:50.537
Look over here,
one, two, three!

00:35:50.912 --> 00:35:53.617
Once more,
smile please.

00:35:53.617 --> 00:35:55.948
One, two, three,
nice heart!

00:35:56.947 --> 00:35:58.071
Okay, one more.

00:35:58.071 --> 00:35:59.819
Just one more,
here we go.

00:35:59.944 --> 00:36:00.735
Hold on.

00:36:05.064 --> 00:36:06.354
It’s Choi Man-gil.

00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:12.806
Are you okay?
We’re under attack!

00:36:12.806 --> 00:36:14.055
What was that?

00:36:21.881 --> 00:36:22.671
Damn brats!

00:36:22.671 --> 00:36:23.504
Run!

00:36:23.879 --> 00:36:27.666
Get over here!

00:36:30.247 --> 00:36:31.538
I got their faces.

00:36:32.786 --> 00:36:36.824
Let’s have a future together
for the sake of our past.

00:36:38.031 --> 00:36:39.113
Certainly.

00:36:39.155 --> 00:36:39.863
Cut!

00:36:40.279 --> 00:36:42.318
Speak without southern accent!

00:36:42.984 --> 00:36:45.524
- Certainly.
- Certainly.

00:36:45.524 --> 00:36:47.938
This is why you’re still
a no-name actress!

00:36:47.979 --> 00:36:48.729
But I…

00:36:48.729 --> 00:36:50.727
I’m really sorry,
let’s go again!

00:36:50.727 --> 00:36:52.308
Did you have an audition…

00:36:52.308 --> 00:36:53.765
I’m sorry, I’m so sorry!

00:36:53.765 --> 00:36:54.515
I’m sorry, sir.

00:36:54.515 --> 00:36:55.139
Get the slate!

00:37:05.337 --> 00:37:06.294
<i>Are you Mr. Jang’s girlfriend?</i>

00:37:06.294 --> 00:37:07.377
<i>He’s cheating on you.</i>

00:37:07.377 --> 00:37:08.417
Son of a…

00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:15.993
<i>Prop Room – Restricted Area
</i>

00:37:27.315 --> 00:37:29.729
<i>Blank Ammunition
</i>

00:37:35.182 --> 00:37:38.346
Unbreakables cannot be killed
by traditional means.

00:37:39.428 --> 00:37:41.551
But they gotta have
some weakness.

00:37:41.551 --> 00:37:42.675
Electricity.

00:37:42.841 --> 00:37:43.507
Electricity?

00:37:43.507 --> 00:37:47.295
High-voltage current is
the only way to kill them.

00:37:47.545 --> 00:37:50.459
But if that method doesn’t work…

00:37:53.747 --> 00:37:54.538
What’s that?

00:37:54.538 --> 00:37:56.869
It’s a special solution I made.

00:37:57.285 --> 00:37:58.992
It’s still being tested,

00:37:59.325 --> 00:38:04.570
but it’s fermented substances
extracted from cat’s anus,

00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:07.025
mixed with other special chemicals.

00:38:07.025 --> 00:38:10.272
This is a very expensive solution.

00:38:19.013 --> 00:38:19.763
You sure?

00:38:20.096 --> 00:38:22.676
Yes, he takes a bath
right after work.

00:38:27.713 --> 00:38:31.210
Water and electricity,
I’m certain this will work.

00:38:31.876 --> 00:38:33.374
Thank you so much.

00:38:34.831 --> 00:38:38.577
One hit with this will do,
why complicate things?

00:38:38.577 --> 00:38:41.990
Anyone will be able to tell
it’s a murder,

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:44.863
and abundance of blood
will be hard to dispose of.

00:38:45.487 --> 00:38:46.652
He’s right.

00:38:57.808 --> 00:38:59.598
What’s that?

00:38:59.889 --> 00:39:03.427
It’s a trigger that I made,
it looks like a lighter,

00:39:03.427 --> 00:39:06.965
but once it’s pressed,
high-voltage will be released.

00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:10.420
So when your husband arrives,
lure him to take a bath,

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:12.335
and when you confirm
he’s in the tub,

00:39:12.335 --> 00:39:14.583
send me a signal,
and I’ll switch it on.

00:39:14.583 --> 00:39:15.707
End of phase 1.

00:39:15.707 --> 00:39:19.453
He’ll die in an unsightly fashion.

00:39:19.453 --> 00:39:21.243
In case you have
very weak stomach,

00:39:21.243 --> 00:39:24.656
I can show you
photos of past jobs.

00:39:24.656 --> 00:39:26.779
No, it’s okay.

00:39:26.779 --> 00:39:29.693
Phase 2, after removing
all equipment from here,

00:39:29.693 --> 00:39:33.064
we dip this live hair dryer
in the water,

00:39:33.064 --> 00:39:36.436
and confirm he’s fully dead
after 2nd electrocution.

00:39:36.436 --> 00:39:39.058
Scream out loud
as if you just found him.

00:39:39.058 --> 00:39:41.889
Make sure it’s loud enough
for your neighbors to hear.

00:39:41.889 --> 00:39:45.802
Then make a call to 911,
work up your emotions,

00:39:45.802 --> 00:39:47.550
and just wait, got it?

00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:50.464
It sounds easy,
but it’s far from it.

00:39:50.464 --> 00:39:55.667
This device is so sensitive that
you need to be extra careful.

00:39:56.416 --> 00:39:56.957
Right.

00:39:57.332 --> 00:39:59.496
Shall we do a dry run?

00:39:59.996 --> 00:40:00.870
What?

00:40:01.744 --> 00:40:03.742
Soccer player Park Ji-sung
once said,

00:40:03.909 --> 00:40:07.447
“True effort will not betray you,
practicing is the only way.”

00:40:07.447 --> 00:40:09.903
Without true effort,
how could you kill?

00:40:09.903 --> 00:40:14.565
Killing is the consummation
of sweat and efforts.

00:40:14.565 --> 00:40:17.645
There’s no time.
I’ll play your husband.

00:40:19.018 --> 00:40:20.142
Okay.

00:40:24.263 --> 00:40:25.470
Hey honey.

00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:26.886
<i>Will you be late today?
</i>

00:40:27.052 --> 00:40:28.967
No, I’m on my way.

00:40:29.383 --> 00:40:31.506
<i>You know it’s our
special day, right?
</i>

00:40:31.506 --> 00:40:34.794
Of course, how could I forget?

00:40:34.794 --> 00:40:36.459
<i>I’ll have your bath ready.
</i>

00:40:36.459 --> 00:40:38.707
Thank you, see you in a bit.

00:40:38.707 --> 00:40:40.081
<i>Princess So-hee</i>

00:40:40.747 --> 00:40:44.618
Is this my birthday
or your death day?

00:40:45.492 --> 00:40:46.533
Action!

00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:50.778
Be natural, greet your husband.

00:40:51.985 --> 00:40:53.484
Welcome home.

00:40:53.484 --> 00:40:54.774
What do you normally do?

00:40:55.024 --> 00:40:57.189
- I give him a hug.
- Then do that.

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:04.972
What the…

00:41:04.972 --> 00:41:06.887
Do you only hug?

00:41:07.262 --> 00:41:08.760
No, kiss too…

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:10.717
Let’s do that too.

00:41:12.507 --> 00:41:14.380
What the hell are you doing?!

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:16.836
Everything has to be perfect…

00:41:18.667 --> 00:41:19.957
Hide, hide!

00:41:19.957 --> 00:41:22.080
No, he wouldn’t ring the bell!

00:41:22.663 --> 00:41:24.286
Washroom!

00:41:30.114 --> 00:41:31.279
Who is it?

00:41:31.529 --> 00:41:33.444
<i>I’m from the women’s society.</i>

00:41:33.444 --> 00:41:34.818
<i>Please vote!
</i>

00:41:35.234 --> 00:41:37.149
I’m really sorry, but…

00:41:39.188 --> 00:41:41.977
No! Please!

00:41:43.892 --> 00:41:44.766
Yang-sun?

00:41:44.933 --> 00:41:46.056
Yang-sun?

00:41:48.679 --> 00:41:52.050
So-hee, it was you?!
You slutty bitch!

00:41:52.342 --> 00:41:54.631
Huh? How did you know
where I live?!

00:41:54.756 --> 00:41:56.504
- Where is he?
- Who?!

00:41:56.504 --> 00:41:58.169
- Where is he!
- Who!

00:41:58.169 --> 00:41:59.085
Where?!

00:41:59.085 --> 00:42:01.791
Why the hell is
that bitch here?

00:42:03.622 --> 00:42:05.121
Who are you looking for?!

00:42:05.662 --> 00:42:08.284
I know everything,
come on out!

00:42:08.576 --> 00:42:11.906
Jang Won-sik!
You son of a bitch!

00:42:19.315 --> 00:42:21.271
Yang-sun! Hey!

00:42:21.604 --> 00:42:23.311
What’s wrong?

00:42:25.475 --> 00:42:27.640
Give me the gun,
please calm down.

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:29.222
- Where is he?
- What?

00:42:29.763 --> 00:42:31.053
- Show me…
- Yang-sun?

00:42:33.134 --> 00:42:36.256
- Yang-sun…
- Lead me!

00:42:36.423 --> 00:42:38.379
What’s going on?!

00:42:38.379 --> 00:42:39.503
- Where is he?
- Huh?

00:42:39.503 --> 00:42:44.165
Yang-sun, calm down,
look at me.

00:42:44.373 --> 00:42:45.206
Yang-sun!

00:42:55.903 --> 00:42:57.693
You stay right there.

00:43:01.897 --> 00:43:05.227
Broccoli, it’s me, Mushroom.

00:43:06.559 --> 00:43:08.474
You’re Broccoli?

00:43:08.474 --> 00:43:09.848
How did you know?

00:43:10.847 --> 00:43:12.137
I can tell.

00:43:14.676 --> 00:43:18.381
Broccoli, Mushroom’s here.

00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:21.461
I’m not mad at all,
come on out.

00:43:21.461 --> 00:43:23.126
Jesus…

00:43:27.164 --> 00:43:29.162
Come on out!

00:43:40.442 --> 00:43:43.481
Sera, what are you doing here?

00:43:43.481 --> 00:43:45.770
Can’t you see I’m taking a dump?

00:43:48.767 --> 00:43:50.224
Sorry about this…

00:43:58.258 --> 00:43:59.631
You bastard!

00:44:02.004 --> 00:44:03.419
Why is Sera taking
a dump here?

00:44:04.293 --> 00:44:05.917
She was in town and stopped by.

00:44:05.917 --> 00:44:09.871
Sit down, Yang-sun,
you need to calm down.

00:44:09.871 --> 00:44:11.245
And head home quickly.

00:44:11.245 --> 00:44:13.284
I was told he’s here…

00:44:13.534 --> 00:44:16.489
- This is #1503, right.
- Yeah, it’s #1503.

00:44:16.489 --> 00:44:19.736
But I have no idea
what you’re talking about!

00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:23.708
My Broccoli really wasn’t here?

00:44:25.706 --> 00:44:27.871
Next door maybe?
Any woman living there?

00:44:27.871 --> 00:44:28.995
An old lady lives alone.

00:44:28.995 --> 00:44:30.618
But who is Broccoli?

00:44:30.618 --> 00:44:31.992
Your boyfriend?

00:44:46.352 --> 00:44:48.225
Why are you looking for
your boyfriend here?!

00:44:48.225 --> 00:44:50.015
You said he’s in Italy!

00:44:50.015 --> 00:44:51.014
Like hell he is!

00:44:51.639 --> 00:44:53.928
Paris university?
Everything was a lie!

00:44:54.261 --> 00:44:56.550
He takes photos of cheaters
as a private detective,

00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:59.381
as if that wasn’t enough,
he became a cheater himself!

00:44:59.797 --> 00:45:03.835
Now he’s saying nonsense,
some alien or crap,

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.081
Unbelievable? Something like that.

00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:11.244
His secretary called me,

00:45:11.244 --> 00:45:13.991
and told me everything
that had happened.

00:45:14.158 --> 00:45:17.613
He said he was a starving artist,
so I supported him!

00:45:18.403 --> 00:45:19.777
Photographer?

00:45:19.777 --> 00:45:22.941
I actually take better photos
than real photographers.

00:45:23.107 --> 00:45:25.188
But he’s a dog in heat!

00:45:25.646 --> 00:45:26.853
Bastard!

00:45:27.061 --> 00:45:30.100
Cheater? I’ve never cheated…

00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:34.387
I’ve never loved anyone
other than my Mushroom, never.

00:45:34.596 --> 00:45:36.302
Then go out and say so.

00:45:36.843 --> 00:45:38.508
I’ll get shot.

00:45:49.622 --> 00:45:53.535
Yang-sun, I’ll give you
some cold water…

00:45:53.535 --> 00:45:55.033
Can I smoke a cigarette?

00:45:57.032 --> 00:45:58.364
Is it no smoking inside?

00:45:59.071 --> 00:46:00.112
No, it’s okay.

00:46:00.112 --> 00:46:03.400
After smoking that,
drink some water and go home.

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:06.522
Let’s meet again soon,
and talk about this.

00:46:07.022 --> 00:46:12.558
Sera bullied and hit
all the boys in school,

00:46:12.932 --> 00:46:17.012
why bother with her?
She’s the worst of us!

00:46:17.012 --> 00:46:17.969
What?

00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:21.382
Why stay friends with her?

00:46:25.045 --> 00:46:27.418
I heard that, bitch.

00:46:27.584 --> 00:46:30.998
Wanna see me bust your head open?

00:46:34.286 --> 00:46:35.368
No…

00:46:40.363 --> 00:46:42.528
- No!
- Don’t!

00:47:05.879 --> 00:47:08.418
Dammit, power outage?

00:47:14.079 --> 00:47:14.954
Don’t smoke?

00:47:28.398 --> 00:47:29.606
Should I get some exercise?

00:48:04.737 --> 00:48:06.028
Is he dead?

00:48:08.492 --> 00:48:09.616
Broccoli?

00:48:21.063 --> 00:48:22.312
Is he dead?

00:48:23.186 --> 00:48:24.351
You killed him.

00:48:27.265 --> 00:48:29.346
- Me?
- Yeah.

00:48:30.095 --> 00:48:32.759
This might sound cruel,

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:35.090
but your boyfriend…

00:48:35.673 --> 00:48:38.712
was killed by you, not us.

00:48:40.585 --> 00:48:42.625
- Me?
- Yeah.

00:48:45.663 --> 00:48:47.245
What…

00:48:48.036 --> 00:48:49.534
What did I do?

00:48:49.701 --> 00:48:51.366
Watch this.

00:49:14.301 --> 00:49:18.131
I… I…

00:49:21.544 --> 00:49:24.957
To be precise,
So-hee’s your accomplice.

00:49:25.373 --> 00:49:27.122
She started all this.

00:49:27.288 --> 00:49:29.619
Me? I did?

00:49:33.032 --> 00:49:34.822
Then you’re an accomplice too.

00:49:34.822 --> 00:49:37.528
Yeah, we’re all accomplices.

00:49:37.861 --> 00:49:41.233
But hey, it all kind of
worked out for you.

00:49:45.187 --> 00:49:47.102
Well, he deserved to die…

00:49:47.601 --> 00:49:51.347
But this is murder!

00:49:51.514 --> 00:49:52.679
Of course not!

00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:54.886
Let’s think positive.

00:49:57.217 --> 00:49:59.298
We’ll help you.

00:50:02.753 --> 00:50:04.584
Thank you.

00:50:13.867 --> 00:50:16.406
Baby, where are you?

00:50:18.445 --> 00:50:22.566
Stairs? Okay, take your time.

00:50:25.896 --> 00:50:27.395
- 5th floor!
- What?!

00:50:27.395 --> 00:50:29.226
Hide the body!

00:50:29.226 --> 00:50:30.309
Get rid of him!

00:50:32.098 --> 00:50:33.139
Move, move!

00:50:34.679 --> 00:50:36.760
What do I do?!

00:50:37.843 --> 00:50:40.215
- Where? Where?
- Over here! There!

00:50:41.672 --> 00:50:42.588
Here? Where?

00:50:42.588 --> 00:50:44.086
In the steamer!

00:50:44.086 --> 00:50:45.169
Head first, head first!

00:50:45.169 --> 00:50:46.626
One, two, three!

00:50:56.907 --> 00:51:00.029
Yeah, let’s clean up,
come at 11 PM.

00:51:02.068 --> 00:51:04.275
Let’s do it right!

00:51:15.139 --> 00:51:17.053
- My gosh!
- Oh no!

00:51:18.136 --> 00:51:22.506
248, 249, 500!

00:51:35.951 --> 00:51:36.950
Hurry! Hurry!

00:51:54.183 --> 00:51:56.056
You walked up the stairs?

00:51:56.056 --> 00:51:57.388
Yeah, there was a power outage.

00:51:59.844 --> 00:52:01.301
What’s this scent?

00:52:03.174 --> 00:52:05.005
I cooked some meat.

00:52:05.755 --> 00:52:06.754
You made boiled pork?

00:52:08.793 --> 00:52:09.917
My honey pie!

00:52:12.165 --> 00:52:13.664
Thank you.

00:52:15.453 --> 00:52:18.201
Baby! Baby!
Go wash up first!

00:52:18.367 --> 00:52:19.782
Why? Why?

00:52:20.865 --> 00:52:22.155
The bath water will get cold.

00:52:22.904 --> 00:52:24.028
Go and wash up.

00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:28.357
Honey, should we take
a bath together?

00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:30.813
I took a shower earlier.

00:52:31.271 --> 00:52:34.060
Go inside, hurry!

00:52:36.682 --> 00:52:38.430
Wash up!

00:52:45.798 --> 00:52:47.838
- Lift him up, lift!
- One, two!

00:53:06.527 --> 00:53:08.151
Lift!

00:53:31.003 --> 00:53:34.707
Making a mushroom soup
with broccoli,

00:53:34.707 --> 00:53:39.911
blow the steam,
and eat it deliciously…

00:53:39.911 --> 00:53:40.951
Done! It’s good!

00:53:52.648 --> 00:53:53.897
That’s enough, come out!

00:53:53.897 --> 00:53:57.060
Broccoli, I’m so sorry!

00:54:02.013 --> 00:54:05.010
Making a mushroom soup
with broccoli…

00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:07.674
Stop it.

00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:10.172
Get it together
and listen to me.

00:54:11.046 --> 00:54:12.420
Listen to me!

00:54:13.918 --> 00:54:15.000
Shush!

00:54:18.331 --> 00:54:19.579
You ready?

00:55:25.305 --> 00:55:26.512
He should be dead, right?

00:55:27.595 --> 00:55:28.594
Probably.

00:55:52.112 --> 00:55:53.152
Holy cow!

00:55:54.068 --> 00:55:55.358
Hello there.

00:55:55.358 --> 00:55:56.482
Evening.

00:55:58.022 --> 00:55:59.396
What brings you here?

00:55:59.396 --> 00:56:00.770
Happy birthday, Man-gil.

00:56:01.769 --> 00:56:02.851
Surprise!

00:56:08.928 --> 00:56:10.926
- Could you get my undies?
- Okay…

00:56:18.086 --> 00:56:20.500
Thank you, thank you!

00:56:20.667 --> 00:56:21.874
Thank you.

00:56:21.874 --> 00:56:23.539
Sorry about what happened
at the hospital.

00:56:23.539 --> 00:56:26.328
It was a strange situation,
I totally understand.

00:56:26.328 --> 00:56:27.243
Have a drink.

00:56:27.243 --> 00:56:29.449
- I’d love some soju.
- Soju?

00:56:29.991 --> 00:56:31.239
Sure, here we go.

00:56:31.239 --> 00:56:32.946
- Good to meet you.
- You too…

00:56:32.946 --> 00:56:35.110
- I’d like some too…
- Sure thing.

00:56:35.568 --> 00:56:38.232
Good to meet you too.

00:56:42.687 --> 00:56:43.645
Is she okay?

00:56:44.311 --> 00:56:46.725
- She’s bipolar.
- Bipolar?

00:56:52.552 --> 00:56:54.425
- Allow me pour you some.
- Sure thing.

00:56:58.754 --> 00:57:00.128
Thank you.

00:57:04.082 --> 00:57:07.787
You’re Yang-sun, right?
Are you married?

00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:09.702
No, not yet.

00:57:09.868 --> 00:57:11.075
How about a boyfriend?

00:57:11.242 --> 00:57:13.490
I had one,
until not too long ago.

00:57:13.656 --> 00:57:14.822
I see…

00:57:16.487 --> 00:57:18.734
- He died a bit ago.
- Pardon?

00:57:24.562 --> 00:57:27.601
- Some time ago…
- I see…

00:57:29.016 --> 00:57:32.221
My condolences,
please excuse my rudeness.

00:57:32.554 --> 00:57:35.010
There’s no order to dying…

00:57:39.422 --> 00:57:41.587
I’m really sorry…

00:57:43.002 --> 00:57:45.499
Was your boyfriend
quite old?

00:57:46.249 --> 00:57:48.580
He died on the job…

00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:51.244
In the line of duty.

00:57:51.826 --> 00:57:53.741
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:57:54.365 --> 00:57:58.986
He must’ve had a lot of
passion for his job.

00:58:00.901 --> 00:58:02.982
Wait, instead of crying,

00:58:03.606 --> 00:58:06.770
let’s toast to your departed boyfriend,

00:58:06.770 --> 00:58:08.518
and change the mood, okay?

00:58:08.809 --> 00:58:10.891
Marin, play some music!

00:58:16.219 --> 00:58:19.840
For Yang-sun’s dearly departed!

00:58:22.546 --> 00:58:25.709
<i>There is a non-garment object
in the steamer.
</i>

00:58:32.286 --> 00:58:33.327
What did he say?

00:58:33.327 --> 00:58:36.324
<i>There is a non-garment object
in the steamer.</i>

00:58:44.066 --> 00:58:45.981
We bought it recently.

00:58:46.522 --> 00:58:49.727
He’s weird sometimes,
machines are just machines.

00:58:49.727 --> 00:58:51.267
Indeed.

00:58:51.933 --> 00:58:52.599
Marin!

00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:56.137
Then what’s in there?

00:58:59.217 --> 00:59:00.591
<i>There is a human…
</i>

00:59:01.174 --> 00:59:02.422
I think it’s busted.

00:59:02.422 --> 00:59:04.254
I should get it fixed.

00:59:18.323 --> 00:59:19.988
Let’s toast again!

00:59:27.064 --> 00:59:28.979
For Yang-sun’s late boyfriend!

00:59:29.146 --> 00:59:30.519
Cheers.

00:59:30.519 --> 00:59:32.434
For her late boyfriend!

00:59:32.601 --> 00:59:34.432
Now that’s better.

00:59:44.797 --> 00:59:45.754
Poison?

01:00:05.859 --> 01:00:07.024
Pour the whole thing.

01:00:07.191 --> 01:00:09.189
If he doesn’t die,
he’ll at least pass out.

01:00:09.189 --> 01:00:10.146
The whole thing?

01:00:12.894 --> 01:00:15.016
- A thousand of them…
- Bastard…

01:00:16.765 --> 01:00:18.430
Hurry.

01:00:25.631 --> 01:00:28.295
Honey, go easy,
we’re all stuffed.

01:00:28.461 --> 01:00:29.918
I’m gonna go out for a smoke.

01:00:30.376 --> 01:00:32.083
Okay.

01:00:34.289 --> 01:00:35.246
Hurry, come on.

01:00:38.576 --> 01:00:40.075
<i>Cleaning Completed
</i>

01:00:51.397 --> 01:00:53.145
<i>Steam Mode ON</i>

01:01:15.498 --> 01:01:17.288
There’s only summer
and winter now.

01:01:17.455 --> 01:01:18.620
It’s already hot outside.

01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:19.411
Is that right?

01:01:20.368 --> 01:01:23.240
I opened a new bottle,
have another drink.

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:24.739
- Shall I?
- Sure.

01:01:26.862 --> 01:01:27.819
Thank you.

01:01:29.484 --> 01:01:32.273
It’s a highly rated wine,
I know you love wine.

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:33.605
Oh yeah?

01:01:33.605 --> 01:01:36.227
Maybe that’s why
the color looks different.

01:01:37.809 --> 01:01:39.433
Thank you for the wine.

01:01:52.087 --> 01:01:52.669
Wait a minute.

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:56.540
I feel bad for drinking
such a good wine alone.

01:01:56.707 --> 01:01:58.164
You’re all drinking soju.

01:02:00.287 --> 01:02:05.032
How about we play
rock-paper-scissors for this?

01:02:08.404 --> 01:02:10.693
Rock, paper, scissors!

01:02:12.108 --> 01:02:13.274
Yang-sun and I won.

01:02:14.689 --> 01:02:16.354
This is for the win.

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:18.851
Here we go,
rock, paper, scissors!

01:02:20.683 --> 01:02:21.432
Oh yes!

01:02:26.968 --> 01:02:30.964
Then I’ll drink this
delicious wine legitimately.

01:02:31.131 --> 01:02:33.670
Thank you so much.

01:02:58.770 --> 01:03:01.684
I can feel Napa Valley.

01:03:03.432 --> 01:03:06.595
Wow, this is incredible.

01:03:06.762 --> 01:03:08.219
Let me see that.

01:03:12.721 --> 01:03:14.719
That’s too much.

01:03:16.861 --> 01:03:18.234
This time…

01:03:19.649 --> 01:03:20.690
Here.

01:03:21.273 --> 01:03:22.563
Drink, drink!

01:03:24.145 --> 01:03:26.434
The scissors player drinks it!
Rock, paper, scissors!

01:03:32.553 --> 01:03:34.551
You’re it!

01:03:36.341 --> 01:03:39.796
I’m jealous you get to drink
this wonderful wine!

01:03:39.821 --> 01:03:40.862
Here.

01:03:41.336 --> 01:03:43.126
- It’s too much…
- Here comes the wine!

01:03:43.126 --> 01:03:46.414
Gulp, gulp, gulp!

01:03:55.156 --> 01:03:56.030
What’s that?

01:04:02.149 --> 01:04:03.522
What’s what?

01:04:04.646 --> 01:04:06.145
Someone’s phone’s ringing.

01:04:08.226 --> 01:04:10.099
That must be mine.

01:04:10.848 --> 01:04:11.847
Yours is right there.

01:04:15.094 --> 01:04:15.760
It could be mine.

01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:18.549
Yours is there.

01:04:18.715 --> 01:04:21.005
Yang-sun’s too,
your phones are all here.

01:04:32.285 --> 01:04:33.992
Honey, wait…

01:04:37.904 --> 01:04:39.112
Is that phone waterproof?

01:04:39.278 --> 01:04:40.985
Yes, I bought it for him.

01:04:40.985 --> 01:04:42.317
You should’ve turned it off!

01:04:43.774 --> 01:04:44.898
No! No!

01:04:44.898 --> 01:04:45.980
- You can’t!
- Wait!

01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:47.062
No! Stop!

01:04:48.727 --> 01:04:49.976
No, no!

01:05:02.671 --> 01:05:03.254
Who are you?

01:05:04.669 --> 01:05:06.043
He must be a thief!

01:05:19.738 --> 01:05:20.778
He’s dead!

01:05:21.444 --> 01:05:22.443
He’s dead!

01:05:22.443 --> 01:05:23.692
Dead!

01:05:29.853 --> 01:05:31.767
- But how…
- Honey…

01:05:38.594 --> 01:05:39.551
Dammit!

01:05:45.087 --> 01:05:47.293
Self-defense!
You all saw me.

01:05:47.293 --> 01:05:50.998
I got into a fight with a home invader,
it was pure self-defense!

01:05:51.165 --> 01:05:52.830
Man-gil, calm down.

01:05:52.830 --> 01:05:55.119
You saw me,
it was self-defense!

01:05:55.119 --> 01:05:58.033
Baby, murder is still murder.

01:05:58.199 --> 01:05:59.240
Right…

01:06:00.114 --> 01:06:03.819
Shit, why did he have to die?

01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:08.272
Let’s turn ourselves in.

01:06:08.439 --> 01:06:11.935
After establishing self-defense,
you’ll receive a 5-year sentence.

01:06:12.102 --> 01:06:14.433
Way more than 5 years.

01:06:15.057 --> 01:06:16.930
Man-gil, listen closely.

01:06:17.097 --> 01:06:19.345
This is a secret
only four of us know.

01:06:19.511 --> 01:06:21.592
We’ll take this secret to our graves.

01:06:21.759 --> 01:06:23.216
This is a simple matter.

01:06:23.416 --> 01:06:25.705
I know a very good spot nearby.

01:06:25.705 --> 01:06:28.411
Construction of a new town
halted many years ago.

01:06:28.744 --> 01:06:30.742
We can bury him there,
that’s it.

01:06:30.908 --> 01:06:33.905
It’ll take over 20 years
to redevelop that area.

01:06:33.905 --> 01:06:35.612
But they’ll never redevelop!

01:06:36.028 --> 01:06:37.110
Just trust me.

01:06:37.485 --> 01:06:39.108
She’s looking out for you.

01:06:41.814 --> 01:06:43.562
What do you think,
Yang-sun?

01:06:46.726 --> 01:06:48.349
Bury him.

01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:55.967
Honey, will we be okay?

01:06:56.425 --> 01:06:59.089
We have to hurry,
we don’t have all night.

01:07:09.287 --> 01:07:10.369
Good evening.

01:07:10.535 --> 01:07:13.116
So… So-hee?

01:07:16.155 --> 01:07:16.946
Man-gil?

01:07:17.487 --> 01:07:18.236
Birthday…

01:07:19.235 --> 01:07:22.107
- It’s your birthday!
- Congrats!

01:07:23.689 --> 01:07:25.187
Thanks guys!

01:07:25.354 --> 01:07:28.309
Why are you all so late?
We cut the cake and everything.

01:07:31.348 --> 01:07:33.929
Yeah, we’re a bit late.

01:07:33.929 --> 01:07:37.092
Say hello, these are
my wife’s friends.

01:07:37.092 --> 01:07:38.882
Say hello to my friends.

01:07:38.882 --> 01:07:40.547
- Hello there.
- Good evening.

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:43.627
Crap…

01:07:45.292 --> 01:07:47.415
Are you… going somewhere?

01:07:47.415 --> 01:07:49.455
Why don’t we all have a drink?

01:07:49.621 --> 01:07:51.120
No, no, it’s too late.

01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:54.908
They drank quite a bit,
I need to help them get home.

01:07:55.074 --> 01:07:58.030
That’s too bad, I wish
we could drink together.

01:07:58.196 --> 01:07:59.653
That’s not it.

01:08:00.943 --> 01:08:04.190
You guys go inside and drink,
I’ll be right back.

01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:06.479
- Yeah, let’s do that.
- Sure, sure!

01:08:06.646 --> 01:08:08.269
Make yourself at home.

01:08:08.269 --> 01:08:09.643
Chill out here.

01:08:09.893 --> 01:08:11.641
- Safe drive.
- I’ll be back!

01:08:11.666 --> 01:08:14.871
- Take care.
- Good bye.

01:08:33.369 --> 01:08:36.158
Good bye, let’s meet in hell.

01:08:41.503 --> 01:08:42.627
Hey…

01:08:45.707 --> 01:08:47.663
Honey, aren’t you tired?

01:08:49.112 --> 01:08:50.985
No, I’m fine.

01:08:51.152 --> 01:08:52.400
You dig so well.

01:08:52.567 --> 01:08:55.564
- I’m pretty good at this.
- For sure.

01:08:56.563 --> 01:08:58.728
So? Should we bury him?

01:09:00.101 --> 01:09:02.432
I think it’s about done,
should we?

01:09:02.724 --> 01:09:03.348
Okay.

01:09:17.542 --> 01:09:20.373
Did I dig too deep?
How do I get out?

01:09:22.204 --> 01:09:24.452
- Help me up.
- Okay.

01:09:25.659 --> 01:09:26.616
In two.

01:09:27.657 --> 01:09:30.779
One, two!

01:09:31.445 --> 01:09:32.485
Honey.

01:09:36.731 --> 01:09:37.980
Bury them.

01:09:38.146 --> 01:09:39.520
Bury! Come on!

01:09:40.144 --> 01:09:41.185
Now!

01:09:53.839 --> 01:09:56.545
He had to dig so deep, eh?

01:09:59.433 --> 01:10:01.723
Are we done?
Is this good?

01:10:01.748 --> 01:10:02.997
We’re done!

01:10:03.954 --> 01:10:06.993
- Jesus Christ…
- Bastard…

01:10:17.066 --> 01:10:17.732
Bastard!

01:10:19.022 --> 01:10:20.104
Get away!

01:10:28.605 --> 01:10:29.271
Hurry!

01:10:33.724 --> 01:10:34.557
Hurry!

01:10:43.798 --> 01:10:44.797
He’s coming!

01:10:46.087 --> 01:10:47.835
He’s behind us!

01:11:14.475 --> 01:11:15.641
Why?

01:11:17.431 --> 01:11:18.555
Where did he go?

01:11:20.553 --> 01:11:23.175
He’s gone!
He’s not there!

01:11:23.883 --> 01:11:25.256
He’s gone!

01:11:36.245 --> 01:11:37.203
What the hell!

01:11:44.362 --> 01:11:45.403
- Cliff!
- I see it!

01:12:13.333 --> 01:12:14.832
So frigging far down…

01:12:14.832 --> 01:12:16.164
We have to find the body.

01:12:17.079 --> 01:12:18.620
At this height,
he’s a goner.

01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:21.159
Even if he’s found,
he’ll be unidentifiable.

01:12:21.325 --> 01:12:22.116
Right?

01:12:22.574 --> 01:12:25.571
What exactly is your husband?

01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:28.776
- Unbreakable.
- What’s that?

01:12:30.566 --> 01:12:31.648
We should go.

01:12:37.934 --> 01:12:40.056
Thank you for
everything.

01:12:40.639 --> 01:12:42.596
Let’s get some rest.

01:12:43.386 --> 01:12:44.136
Holy cow!

01:12:47.466 --> 01:12:50.255
- What the hell?
- What do we do?

01:12:50.921 --> 01:12:53.793
Isn’t it obvious?
Bury them all…

01:12:53.793 --> 01:12:55.250
Dammit…

01:12:55.250 --> 01:12:58.913
Why are things getting complicated?

01:12:59.828 --> 01:13:01.119
Christ…

01:13:04.366 --> 01:13:10.235
I just want to hop in the bath
after this is over.

01:13:10.235 --> 01:13:13.398
Let’s go to a sauna then,
and get some soup too.

01:13:14.356 --> 01:13:19.351
Yeah, with a nice cold drink
with ice floating on top…

01:13:20.766 --> 01:13:21.848
Huh? What the hell?!

01:13:25.912 --> 01:13:27.493
What’s that? Cops?

01:13:27.493 --> 01:13:29.408
Shit, should I turn
the car around?

01:13:29.783 --> 01:13:31.864
No, we’ll attract more attention.

01:13:31.864 --> 01:13:33.404
Let’s just stop at the checkpoint.

01:13:33.654 --> 01:13:34.903
We’re screwed…

01:13:35.652 --> 01:13:37.608
Hey, hey, be natural.

01:13:37.608 --> 01:13:40.688
- Natural…
- Be natural.

01:13:53.384 --> 01:13:54.466
Good evening.

01:13:54.466 --> 01:13:56.006
- Hello there.
- Evening.

01:13:56.006 --> 01:13:58.504
We had an army desertion incident.

01:13:58.504 --> 01:14:01.334
- Could I see your IDs?
- My ID?

01:14:04.082 --> 01:14:05.164
Where are you heading?

01:14:05.164 --> 01:14:09.451
We had a couples’ night out,
and we’re heading home.

01:14:11.949 --> 01:14:13.822
Couples’ night out, huh?

01:14:14.863 --> 01:14:18.151
I noticed that the headlight
is busted there,

01:14:18.151 --> 01:14:19.525
were you in an accident?

01:14:19.941 --> 01:14:23.604
An accident? Yeah,
we had a fender bender.

01:14:23.604 --> 01:14:25.727
So you had one,
no one was injured?

01:14:25.727 --> 01:14:26.851
Of course not.

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:28.682
I see.

01:14:29.556 --> 01:14:34.052
How come you have
an extra man in there?

01:14:35.384 --> 01:14:38.714
He’s a bachelor,
he just tagged along.

01:14:38.714 --> 01:14:39.505
Right.

01:14:39.505 --> 01:14:42.210
A bachelor? 7th wheel?

01:14:43.168 --> 01:14:45.374
Why are all men like that?

01:14:50.369 --> 01:14:52.117
I had a celebration earlier,

01:14:52.117 --> 01:14:54.906
so we all had a drink.

01:14:54.906 --> 01:14:57.487
Everyone drank before driving?

01:15:00.067 --> 01:15:01.649
Did you drink as well?

01:15:02.482 --> 01:15:04.396
I didn’t drink at all.

01:15:06.478 --> 01:15:08.684
- You did.
- I certainly did not.

01:15:08.684 --> 01:15:10.932
- You really didn’t?
- Nope.

01:15:10.932 --> 01:15:14.595
Okay, then could you
come out for a bit?

01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:16.967
I said I didn’t drink.

01:15:16.967 --> 01:15:20.630
She said everyone drank,
I just want to check.

01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:23.003
Could you please get out?

01:15:27.457 --> 01:15:28.539
Damn…

01:15:30.162 --> 01:15:31.536
Here, take your ID back.

01:15:38.904 --> 01:15:40.236
What’s wrong?
Are you okay?

01:15:40.236 --> 01:15:42.983
Men don’t need to
get out, right?

01:15:42.983 --> 01:15:44.481
No, it’s fine,
keep them inside.

01:15:44.481 --> 01:15:45.730
Sure, sure.

01:15:47.145 --> 01:15:50.808
I’ll now conduct a breathalyzer test.

01:15:50.808 --> 01:15:54.471
Put your lips on the straw
and blow into it.

01:15:56.636 --> 01:15:58.051
Blow.

01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:03.504
What are you doing?
Don’t suck on it, blow!

01:16:03.962 --> 01:16:05.918
Come on now, blow.

01:16:05.918 --> 01:16:07.542
Hold on.

01:16:08.541 --> 01:16:09.789
Will you keep this up?

01:16:09.789 --> 01:16:11.329
I was blowing.

01:16:11.995 --> 01:16:14.535
You’re just pretending to.

01:16:14.535 --> 01:16:16.158
This is your last warning.

01:16:16.158 --> 01:16:19.280
If you don’t comply,
we’ll arrest you.

01:16:23.692 --> 01:16:25.732
All right, this is good.
You’re angry, right?

01:16:25.732 --> 01:16:28.687
Use that to breathe into it,
use your anger.

01:16:28.687 --> 01:16:30.019
I’m angry, blow!

01:16:30.019 --> 01:16:30.852
That’s it.

01:16:30.852 --> 01:16:32.350
Think about the men,

01:16:32.350 --> 01:16:35.763
who made you drive even though
you all drank together, good!

01:16:35.763 --> 01:16:38.011
More! More!

01:16:38.011 --> 01:16:40.842
More! More! Angrier!

01:16:40.842 --> 01:16:43.256
Okay, that’s it.
You did good.

01:16:44.088 --> 01:16:45.920
The level is rising.

01:16:48.501 --> 01:16:51.414
You see? Check it out.

01:16:53.079 --> 01:16:55.202
<i>Your license is revoked
at this level.</i>

01:16:55.202 --> 01:16:57.700
<i>Put your thumbprint on it.</i>

01:17:02.695 --> 01:17:05.900
Officer Kim,
go wake their husbands.

01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:07.648
- Okay.
- What?

01:17:07.939 --> 01:17:09.230
No, you can’t!

01:17:09.230 --> 01:17:12.726
As per regulation,
all passengers must be checked.

01:17:13.892 --> 01:17:15.266
No!

01:17:15.432 --> 01:17:16.598
Don’t tell me what not to do.

01:17:16.598 --> 01:17:17.597
Out of the way.

01:17:17.597 --> 01:17:20.885
- No! No!
- You can’t! Stop!

01:17:20.885 --> 01:17:22.134
- Stop that!
- Let go of me!

01:17:22.134 --> 01:17:23.133
No! Stop!

01:17:23.133 --> 01:17:24.090
You can’t! No way!

01:17:24.090 --> 01:17:26.255
We can arrest you for
unlawful interference!

01:17:26.255 --> 01:17:27.628
Okay, fine, fine.

01:17:27.628 --> 01:17:29.918
I’m not leaving, okay?

01:17:31.999 --> 01:17:34.122
What’s with you?!

01:17:38.534 --> 01:17:40.823
They’re all awake.

01:17:45.277 --> 01:17:46.651
They didn’t die fully.

01:17:47.234 --> 01:17:48.316
- What the hell?
- What are they?

01:17:48.732 --> 01:17:49.731
Cop’s coming.

01:17:54.643 --> 01:17:56.349
I don’t believe it…

01:17:57.473 --> 01:17:59.638
- Hello.
- Good evening.

01:17:59.638 --> 01:18:00.887
You’re all awake.

01:18:01.927 --> 01:18:04.300
I’d like to check your IDs.

01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:06.589
Could you all present
a piece of ID?

01:18:09.087 --> 01:18:10.502
What took you so long?

01:18:10.502 --> 01:18:14.248
I found a homeless
under a bridge on the way,

01:18:14.248 --> 01:18:15.788
so I brought him here.

01:18:16.246 --> 01:18:18.119
- Come in.
- Come.

01:18:20.825 --> 01:18:22.282
What’s wrong with him?

01:18:22.282 --> 01:18:26.528
Dementia or loss of memory,
he doesn’t remember who he is.

01:18:26.528 --> 01:18:27.443
So cold…

01:18:27.443 --> 01:18:28.317
Dementia?

01:18:28.317 --> 01:18:32.064
We’ll keep him here
and send him to a shelter.

01:18:32.771 --> 01:18:34.603
You look familiar…

01:18:36.601 --> 01:18:39.140
Where did I see you…

01:19:09.276 --> 01:19:13.938
Which elementary school
did you go to?

01:19:16.727 --> 01:19:18.476
- What?
- You know him?

01:19:24.303 --> 01:19:25.594
No, I don’t…

01:19:36.707 --> 01:19:40.579
- What’s going on…
- Zombies are everywhere…

01:19:40.995 --> 01:19:42.785
You were born in 1994 too?

01:19:42.785 --> 01:19:44.366
Yes, 1994.

01:19:44.366 --> 01:19:46.656
- Not 1964?
- 1994.

01:19:46.656 --> 01:19:47.613
Who is?

01:19:47.613 --> 01:19:50.152
We’re all friends,
everyone’s 1994.

01:19:50.152 --> 01:19:53.690
You don’t have a mirror at home?
Just look at him.

01:19:53.690 --> 01:19:54.898
What’s wrong with you!

01:19:54.898 --> 01:19:57.895
Why are you picking on me?
I was born in 1994!

01:19:57.895 --> 01:19:59.851
Okay, fine, what’s your
national ID number?

01:19:59.851 --> 01:20:01.641
940907…

01:20:01.641 --> 01:20:03.431
Sorry, I’m really sorry.

01:20:03.431 --> 01:20:05.845
If you’re 1994,
I was born in 2004.

01:20:05.845 --> 01:20:07.593
0907…

01:20:07.593 --> 01:20:09.716
- 2467.
- 2467.

01:20:09.716 --> 01:20:12.505
- 324.
- 324.

01:20:13.879 --> 01:20:15.793
See? It’s Seung-cheol.

01:20:16.085 --> 01:20:18.624
What exactly happened
in 1994?

01:20:20.039 --> 01:20:22.079
You hid so well for so long.

01:20:22.079 --> 01:20:24.160
- Where’s Choi Man-gil?
- I don’t know.

01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:25.825
You better spill it.

01:20:25.825 --> 01:20:30.071
How does it feel
to sell out your own kind?!

01:20:30.404 --> 01:20:33.442
- Backstabbers!
- I’ve had enough.

01:21:10.322 --> 01:21:11.904
Hide, hide, go!

01:21:12.570 --> 01:21:13.444
Over there!

01:21:30.802 --> 01:21:32.508
- Good evening.
- How can I help you?

01:21:34.839 --> 01:21:36.463
What brings you here?

01:21:39.293 --> 01:21:41.957
Do you know me?

01:21:45.953 --> 01:21:47.077
You don’t?

01:21:47.285 --> 01:21:48.492
I don’t.

01:21:49.525 --> 01:21:51.190
Could I use your phone?

01:21:51.190 --> 01:21:52.522
Sure, over here.

01:21:54.936 --> 01:21:58.266
Which elementary school
did you go to?

01:22:03.511 --> 01:22:04.968
You can use this one.

01:22:07.548 --> 01:22:09.005
Are you all right?

01:22:09.755 --> 01:22:12.086
I’m fine, I slipped while hiking.

01:22:14.583 --> 01:22:15.540
Does it hurt?

01:22:26.446 --> 01:22:27.820
Turn it off!

01:22:39.392 --> 01:22:42.472
- Honey?
- Baby.

01:22:43.179 --> 01:22:46.343
What’s going on?
I looked everywhere for you.

01:22:46.343 --> 01:22:46.967
Yeah?

01:22:48.258 --> 01:22:49.506
Are you okay?

01:22:53.169 --> 01:22:54.085
Where is he?

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.954
I really don’t know,
have you always been lied to?

01:23:15.647 --> 01:23:16.105
Does it hurt?

01:23:17.063 --> 01:23:18.561
But that was just a taste.

01:23:18.561 --> 01:23:20.351
How’d I know where he is?

01:23:20.975 --> 01:23:23.223
Yeah? This will really hurt.

01:23:23.223 --> 01:23:24.305
Brace yourself.

01:23:28.967 --> 01:23:30.216
Hold on.

01:23:32.381 --> 01:23:33.838
I haven’t started yet.

01:23:34.795 --> 01:23:35.794
I’ll go again.

01:23:35.794 --> 01:23:37.667
Okay, brace yourself.

01:23:52.319 --> 01:23:55.025
Old man, you should spill it.

01:24:00.353 --> 01:24:02.642
We got Choi’s location.

01:24:02.809 --> 01:24:03.516
Yeah?

01:24:03.516 --> 01:24:04.807
No mistakes this time.

01:24:05.306 --> 01:24:05.806
Yes, sir!

01:24:12.008 --> 01:24:13.506
Alcohol is always the problem.

01:24:13.798 --> 01:24:16.587
Gents, please take back
your wives safely.

01:24:16.836 --> 01:24:18.585
Whoever didn’t drink
should drive.

01:24:18.918 --> 01:24:20.041
I can drive.

01:24:20.041 --> 01:24:21.498
And I have a favor to ask you.

01:24:21.498 --> 01:24:25.328
Could you drop him off
at a police station in the city?

01:24:25.328 --> 01:24:28.741
I called already,
so they’ll take over.

01:24:28.741 --> 01:24:30.614
- Sure, I understand.
- Okay.

01:24:31.155 --> 01:24:32.321
Hop in, everyone.

01:24:33.736 --> 01:24:34.693
Watch your head.

01:24:40.396 --> 01:24:41.145
Thank you.

01:24:41.145 --> 01:24:42.519
Get checked up
at the hospital.

01:24:42.519 --> 01:24:46.057
It doesn’t hurt.
Take care.

01:24:46.057 --> 01:24:48.055
- Sure thing.
- Good bye!

01:24:48.055 --> 01:24:48.763
Get checked up!

01:25:00.418 --> 01:25:04.455
Honey, what the heck is going on?

01:25:05.121 --> 01:25:07.619
And wasn’t that thief dead?

01:25:08.118 --> 01:25:09.908
And why are you all here?

01:25:09.908 --> 01:25:11.823
I don’t know, why’re we here?

01:25:11.823 --> 01:25:16.443
Jeez, what in the world
is going on here, tell me.

01:25:17.859 --> 01:25:19.732
- You don’t remember?
- No.

01:25:20.398 --> 01:25:22.687
I remember up to
when I was digging.

01:25:22.978 --> 01:25:24.727
But I don’t remember
anything after that.

01:25:25.767 --> 01:25:30.596
So what happened was…

01:25:34.467 --> 01:25:35.966
- Pee!
- Pee?

01:25:35.966 --> 01:25:38.921
You were digging
and said you needed to pee…

01:25:38.921 --> 01:25:39.753
I did?

01:25:42.001 --> 01:25:43.583
So you went into the woods,

01:25:43.583 --> 01:25:48.495
then you screamed and
didn’t come back.

01:25:49.952 --> 01:25:54.156
After a while, we went back
to your place, hoping you’d be back,

01:25:54.530 --> 01:25:57.278
but all your friends were passed out,

01:25:57.278 --> 01:26:00.316
and we were rushing them
to the hospital…

01:26:01.315 --> 01:26:03.230
Then we got held up
by the checkpoint.

01:26:04.395 --> 01:26:05.644
Don’t be shocked.

01:26:06.602 --> 01:26:09.266
We went to where
you disappeared,

01:26:09.599 --> 01:26:11.472
and you know what was there?

01:26:11.472 --> 01:26:13.220
A huge cliff!

01:26:15.384 --> 01:26:16.592
I was so surprised…

01:26:18.257 --> 01:26:20.130
I thought you were
gone for good…

01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:23.335
I was so scared.

01:26:28.829 --> 01:26:34.365
But why go home,
when I disappeared?

01:26:37.321 --> 01:26:38.486
That sounds weird.

01:26:38.486 --> 01:26:42.357
Shouldn’t you look for me,
instead of going home?

01:26:44.272 --> 01:26:45.854
The thing is…

01:26:53.346 --> 01:26:54.221
Wait.

01:26:59.132 --> 01:27:01.796
Yeah, heading home
was the right call.

01:27:01.796 --> 01:27:05.168
Looking for each other
could have made it worse.

01:27:05.792 --> 01:27:07.083
- That’s right.
- That’s right.

01:27:09.039 --> 01:27:10.246
Weird thing is,

01:27:10.246 --> 01:27:12.993
you said I fell while peeing.

01:27:13.701 --> 01:27:17.114
Then why isn’t my pants wet at all?

01:27:23.108 --> 01:27:25.065
Maybe you fell after peeing.

01:27:25.606 --> 01:27:26.397
After shaking it off?

01:27:27.895 --> 01:27:29.144
And after zipping myself up?

01:27:29.893 --> 01:27:30.975
Honey, be quiet!

01:27:31.808 --> 01:27:34.347
So embarrassing,
be quiet!

01:27:35.221 --> 01:27:36.636
That’s enough!

01:27:50.414 --> 01:27:52.246
Why did you stop the car?

01:27:52.954 --> 01:27:54.244
Now I feel like peeing.

01:27:56.117 --> 01:27:57.449
Then hurry up.

01:28:03.693 --> 01:28:05.732
Not gonna go?

01:28:11.144 --> 01:28:11.768
Why?

01:28:13.183 --> 01:28:16.097
Will you hit me with the shovel
and push me down the cliff again?

01:28:18.428 --> 01:28:18.969
What?

01:28:22.715 --> 01:28:24.089
Where are you going?

01:28:36.102 --> 01:28:37.101
What’s with you?

01:28:38.484 --> 01:28:39.566
Let’s all die.

01:28:43.229 --> 01:28:44.270
Don’t do that!

01:28:46.101 --> 01:28:48.099
No!

01:29:46.541 --> 01:29:47.540
My foot!

01:29:52.784 --> 01:29:54.366
Hurry!

01:29:54.991 --> 01:29:56.156
My foot!

01:29:56.697 --> 01:29:57.738
Oh my god!

01:29:57.738 --> 01:29:59.278
Quick!

01:30:34.742 --> 01:30:38.364
Gunshots don’t kill him,
and so is knifing him in the head,

01:30:38.364 --> 01:30:39.946
what the hell is he?

01:30:39.946 --> 01:30:41.652
I told you,
he’s Unbreakable!

01:30:41.652 --> 01:30:43.109
What the hell is it?!

01:30:43.442 --> 01:30:45.648
An invincible being!

01:30:51.601 --> 01:30:52.683
There, there!

01:30:57.095 --> 01:30:58.552
Oh no, please!

01:31:01.591 --> 01:31:02.465
Out of the way!

01:31:18.324 --> 01:31:19.031
Careful, careful!

01:31:36.306 --> 01:31:37.263
Close the door!

01:32:00.657 --> 01:32:01.864
He disappeared without a trace.

01:32:10.896 --> 01:32:11.937
Flashlight.

01:32:16.932 --> 01:32:18.222
Shit.

01:32:25.299 --> 01:32:27.921
Which elementary school
did you go to?

01:32:30.627 --> 01:32:31.584
Grab him.

01:32:41.324 --> 01:32:43.364
He’s coming,
we need to move!

01:32:57.725 --> 01:32:58.433
So-hee?

01:33:08.090 --> 01:33:10.587
So-hee, stop playing.

01:33:11.503 --> 01:33:13.168
I can smell you.

01:33:15.499 --> 01:33:16.623
So-hee?

01:33:29.152 --> 01:33:31.150
I can smell you.

01:33:38.476 --> 01:33:39.600
Not here?

01:33:52.878 --> 01:33:53.794
Go, hurry!

01:34:25.512 --> 01:34:26.969
Sera…

01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:29.092
Yang-sun…

01:34:47.032 --> 01:34:50.779
No, go away, asshole!

01:34:50.779 --> 01:34:51.694
Go away!

01:34:54.858 --> 01:34:56.648
Sera!

01:35:02.350 --> 01:35:04.973
Things would’ve been easy
if you died back then.

01:35:15.296 --> 01:35:16.461
You’re tenacious.

01:35:38.522 --> 01:35:41.977
<i>Choi Man-gil, you’re under arrest.
Surrender at once!</i>

01:36:15.444 --> 01:36:18.399
Yang-sun, wake up!

01:36:19.773 --> 01:36:20.689
Get up!

01:36:22.936 --> 01:36:24.976
Sera, wake up!

01:36:25.434 --> 01:36:26.017
Hey!

01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:43.499
How does it feel to meet
your comrades again?

01:37:28.954 --> 01:37:30.286
Where did he go?

01:38:02.170 --> 01:38:03.169
Dammit, it’s Man-gil!

01:38:03.336 --> 01:38:04.168
Let’s run!

01:38:05.209 --> 01:38:06.208
Captain.

01:38:07.166 --> 01:38:07.832
What is it?

01:38:07.832 --> 01:38:10.246
- They’re Man-gil’s men.
- Grab them!

01:39:25.088 --> 01:39:27.627
It’s a special solution I made.

01:39:38.408 --> 01:39:41.613
<i>Had fun betraying us
to be human’s slave?</i>

01:39:55.557 --> 01:39:57.014
Son of a bitch…

01:40:16.911 --> 01:40:19.283
- So-hee!
- It’s okay.

01:40:57.953 --> 01:40:59.368
You did good.

01:41:25.675 --> 01:41:29.630
<i>1 year later</i>

01:41:33.209 --> 01:41:36.706
- Tada!
- I never drink and drive now!

01:41:37.705 --> 01:41:40.785
Damn, this wine’s incredible!
Where is it from?

01:41:40.910 --> 01:41:43.116
Looks like you could
use some more wine.

01:41:53.482 --> 01:41:54.481
Broccoli?

01:41:57.062 --> 01:41:58.269
Broccoli?

01:41:58.727 --> 01:42:00.600
Hi, my Mushroom.

01:42:05.511 --> 01:42:06.594
Broccoli!

01:42:10.215 --> 01:42:11.505
Broccoli!

01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:15.834
- But how?!
- Mushroom!

01:42:16.084 --> 01:42:17.791
- Are you all right?
- I’m fine!

01:42:17.791 --> 01:42:18.748
You okay?

01:42:19.581 --> 01:42:21.745
- I’m fine, let’s drink.
- You sure you’re okay?

01:42:26.532 --> 01:42:27.573
What’s this?

01:42:28.905 --> 01:42:31.111
Did I just get proposed to?
