Captain, nothing to report.

6
00:01:39,005 --> 00:01:41,005
Get some rest, sir.

7
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,422
I'll sleep when the situation is resolved.

8
00:01:47,005 --> 00:01:48,005
What the...?

9
00:01:50,005 --> 00:01:51,505
How did you find me?

10
00:01:53,672 --> 00:01:58,047
Aren't we doing this for food, anyway?

11
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,005
Does anyone know you're here?

12
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:04,672
Don't worry, I reported to the captain.

13
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:13,005
I hope it is well seasoned

14
00:02:18,922 --> 00:02:19,922
Know...?

15
00:02:20,672 --> 00:02:21,797
That?

16
00:02:25,172 --> 00:02:29,005
There are shots! There are shots! All units report!

17
00:02:30,505 --> 00:02:31,838
Wait here

Captain, we have a lead.

22
00:03:29,213 --> 00:03:32,797
Do you want me to wait until they rob us?

23
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:35,088
We will enter, come with me.

24
00:03:44,463 --> 00:03:47,005
Hwa-ryung, bring up the rear, the rest with me.

25
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,630
Comrade Lim...

26
00:03:49,505 --> 00:03:51,005
Let's wait for reinforcement.

27
00:03:52,588 --> 00:03:54,005
And watch the sunrise?

28
00:04:26,297 --> 00:04:27,838
Do not move.

29
00:04:29,005 --> 00:04:30,005
Clean it up.

30
00:04:35,005 --> 00:04:36,005
stay!

31
00:04:45,047 --> 00:04:47,005
Stay still, he said.

32
00:04:47,172 --> 00:04:48,463
I'll count to three.

33
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,422
If they don't drop their weapons,

34
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,005
They will take one bullet per head.

35
00:04:55,005 --> 00:04:56,005
One.

36
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:57,838
Two.

37
00:05:02,255 --> 00:05:04,005
I told you to wait.

38
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:07,213
Do you ever listen?

39
00:05:09,005 --> 00:05:12,588
It's not worth spilling blood between comrades.

40
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,422
Put down your gun and come here,

41
00:05:16,005 --> 00:05:18,505
We need a face to face.

42
00:05:21,505 --> 00:05:23,047
Think about it.

43
00:05:29,005 --> 00:05:30,005
I am right?

44
00:05:30,255 --> 00:05:31,255
Shut up!

45
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,630
Yeah?

46
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:40,172
If you force me, his head will fly off.

47
00:05:41,088 --> 00:05:42,088
Wait!

48
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,630
Put the gun down.

49
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,088
The rest of you too.

50
00:06:01,505 --> 00:06:02,505
will you come down

51
00:06:24,297 --> 00:06:25,505
Cover up!

00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,213
Cheol-ryung, are you alright?

54
00:07:17,172 --> 00:07:21,797
This may sound weird, but I never liked them.

55
00:07:22,005 --> 00:07:25,297
The censors are lap dogs, loyal to the Republic.

56
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:28,713
Rabid lapdogs.

57
00:07:38,297 --> 00:07:40,172

My mercy...

00:07:53,505 --> 00:07:56,047
It's the only reason you live

61
00:07:56,713 --> 00:07:58,797
and not by the leader you serve.

62
00:08:01,588 --> 00:08:04,505
I have a job for you, go tell the Republic.

63
00:08:05,047 --> 00:08:08,172
I will take the plates as payment for the blood of the people.

64
00:08:11,422 --> 00:08:12,630
See you.

00:08:29,255 --> 00:08:32,922
can perfectly replicate all security measures,

68
00:08:33,005 --> 00:08:35,588
and evade any counterfeit detection

69
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,005
with the newest technology available around the world.

70
00:08:39,172 --> 00:08:43,172
The engraved plates used to print them

71
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,713
and within 1 micrometer...

72
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,630
Go to the point.

73
00:08:53,047 --> 00:08:56,588
The plates were stolen.

74
00:08:57,005 --> 00:08:59,255
After the 2010 counterfeiting scandal,

75
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:11,005
Sanctioned production is like a declaration of war!

76
00:09:12,047 --> 00:09:13,255
Who is the suspect?

77
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,005
Cha gi-sung, 44 years old, born in Hoeryong,

78
00:09:25,588 --> 00:09:29,005
He was demoted for stealing drugs from the Republic.

79
00:09:29,172 --> 00:09:33,797
His wife was punished for covering up, and died in prison.

80
00:09:34,005 --> 00:09:37,422
It is presumed that he reunited his old squad again...

81
00:09:39,172 --> 00:09:42,297
The Minister of Security has detected your route outside the Republic,

82
00:09:43,005 --> 00:09:45,005
and reached Chungdo on the 12th.

83
00:09:45,255 --> 00:09:48,005
He passed through Beijing and arrived in Dalian...

84
00:09:54,005 --> 00:09:58,005
We're in communication, but China was just a stop,

85
00:09:58,422 --> 00:10:01,713
and took a plane from Dalian today.

86
00:10:02,005 --> 00:10:03,422

Bastard!

91
00:10:46,005 --> 00:10:47,672
Where will you go now?

92
00:10:48,713 --> 00:10:52,255
Look what I had to do to catch you.

93
00:10:55,505 --> 00:10:57,213
Okay, okay, don't come.

94
00:10:58,005 --> 00:10:59,713
Let's talk about this!

95
00:11:01,505 --> 00:11:04,838
Don't come close, I'll cut you down.

96
00:11:07,172 --> 00:11:08,172
Never!

97
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:13,005
Daddy, answer the phone! Don't pretend to be busy!

98
00:11:14,005 --> 00:11:15,463
Can I take care of my daughter?

99
00:11:15,922 --> 00:11:17,213
Daddy, answer!

100
00:11:18,505 --> 00:11:20,463
¡Papi!

101
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,297
Yes darling.

102
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,463
¿Íphone?

103
00:11:34,797 --> 00:11:35,797
Let's be honest...

104
00:11:36,088 --> 00:11:38,005
did you accept a bribe?

105
00:11:38,088 --> 00:11:41,213
What bribe? I never would!

106
00:11:41,297 --> 00:11:44,005
So why let it go?

107
00:11:44,797 --> 00:11:47,588
I couldn't do anything in the first place.

108
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,213
I know, I watched too.

109
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,713
Stop compromising.

110
00:12:01,005 --> 00:12:02,005
What are you saying?

111
00:12:02,713 --> 00:12:06,672
You can't leave our conversation like this!

112
00:12:15,005 --> 00:12:17,255
Oh really?

113
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:22,088
He came at me with a knife, I'm not Robocop!

114
00:12:23,005 --> 00:12:24,297
Boss Pyo!

115
00:12:28,797 --> 00:12:30,297
In it. Kang!

116
00:12:31,005 --> 00:12:33,172
Idiot, I told you to call the boss first!

117
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:37,005
I thought the arrest came before.

118
00:12:37,713 --> 00:12:39,797
Stupid fool...

119
00:12:43,172 --> 00:12:44,172
About what?

120
00:12:45,088 --> 00:12:46,088
It was my mistake.

121
00:12:47,172 --> 00:12:48,672
Forget it, idiot.

122
00:12:49,088 --> 00:12:51,213
A newbie can't start with a mistake like that.

123
00:12:54,005 --> 00:12:56,672
Go away, everything is done.

124
00:12:57,005 --> 00:12:58,255
It's part of being a cop.

125
00:13:00,005 --> 00:13:01,838
All right, go inside.

126
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:12,713
So the 12th District brigade leader, Cap. Cha Gi Sung.

127
00:13:13,005 --> 00:13:14,838
He fled the country

128
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,172
but Major Lim Cheol-Ryung was in their ranks.

129
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,005
Why did he leave you alive?

130
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,463
What's your plan with Cha?

131
00:13:33,005 --> 00:13:34,588
We are confused

132
00:13:36,588 --> 00:13:38,463
If you dont do it,

133
00:13:40,005 --> 00:13:44,005
I'll go after Cha to the gates of hell.

134
00:13:48,422 --> 00:13:49,422
Dejennos.

135
00:13:57,172 --> 00:14:01,797
A north-south ministerial talk will take place next week.

136
00:14:02,588 --> 00:14:06,380
It is an unprecedented event that we put in place.

137
00:14:08,672 --> 00:14:12,005
I'm going to include you in the delegation.

138
00:14:15,713 --> 00:14:18,797
Go and capture Cha.

139
00:14:28,463 --> 00:14:30,463
I didn't take the bribe!

140
00:14:33,922 --> 00:14:36,297
Yeon-ah, my Princess, come here!

141
00:14:37,588 --> 00:14:39,505
All right, close the curtains.

142
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:41,047
Üphonel

143
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:45,005
When will you buy it? You promised me!

144
00:14:47,047 --> 00:14:48,297
I will buy it today!

145
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,172
Brother in law! It's an emergency!

146
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:08,005
Jesus, 31,000 is...

147
00:15:08,213 --> 00:15:10,005
Shhh! Be quiet.

148
00:15:17,505 --> 00:15:20,005
Brother, we are better than this.

149
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,880
Talk to your sister!

150
00:15:25,005 --> 00:15:28,005
Send it to my account, okay?

151
00:15:29,005 --> 00:15:30,005
What's going on here?

152
00:15:30,172 --> 00:15:34,047
Did you see his face? You must be overworked.

153
00:15:40,797 --> 00:15:42,630
Hey, idiot, aren't you going to work?

154
00:15:50,005 --> 00:15:51,297
I'll answer then, hello?

155
00:15:51,797 --> 00:15:52,880
- He doesn't res... - Give it to me!

156
00:15:53,005 --> 00:15:55,005
I knew you would attend

157
00:15:55,047 --> 00:15:56,297
Come have breakfast!

158
00:15:58,255 --> 00:15:59,255
Hello?

159
00:16:01,005 --> 00:16:01,880
Good morning.

160
00:16:02,005 --> 00:16:03,297
¡ Jin-tae!

161
00:16:05,088 --> 00:16:06,172
Lots of trash!

162
00:16:06,297 --> 00:16:07,255
- Why are you here? - Let me help.

163
00:16:09,172 --> 00:16:10,255
Are you rested?

164
00:16:14,797 --> 00:16:17,005
15 years of collaboration don't mean shit.

165
00:16:26,297 --> 00:16:27,297
Did you come to tell me that?

166
00:16:34,213 --> 00:16:35,297
Joint investigation?

167
00:16:36,005 --> 00:16:39,380
Have you heard about the ministry talk next week?

168
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,630
Your delegation will include a detective.

169
00:16:43,213 --> 00:16:45,005
An agent of the censorship bureau.

170
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:48,005
Anyway, there was a criminal who defected to the south,

171
00:16:51,005 --> 00:16:53,005
What crime did he commit?

172
00:16:53,422 --> 00:16:54,463
I don't know.

173
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,005
It's an order from the commissioner.

174
00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:08,672
Do you want me babysitting a communist?

175
00:17:09,005 --> 00:17:11,005
- Don't call them that. - Forget it!

176
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:15,505
I worked for a just society, but I'm just a dirty cop.

177
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:17,213
And now you want me to do what?

178
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:21,005
How much more must I sacrifice for my country?

179
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,588
You're hopeless. You really don't have it.

180
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,588
You don't get it, do you?

181
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:31,505
I'm trying to do you a favor.

182
00:17:33,297 --> 00:17:35,255
Forget it, I won't beg.

183
00:17:43,005 --> 00:17:46,005
And you can't trust these details to a novice.

184
00:17:50,588 --> 00:17:53,713
Lots of trash...

185
00:17:53,838 --> 00:17:57,297
Today at 12:50 p.m.

186
00:17:58,588 --> 00:18:01,088
Brother, pass me the controller.

187
00:18:01,922 --> 00:18:03,005
There there.

188
00:18:04,005 --> 00:18:06,505
Inter-Korean ministerial talks to proceed...

189
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,255
After a long period of inactivity,

190
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:15,047
the talk started by the North is getting a lot of attention.

191
00:18:17,255 --> 00:18:21,088
With this case, you will be reinstated,

192
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,005
Dear

193
00:18:35,838 --> 00:18:38,297
Thanks for everything, things will get better.

194
00:18:40,463 --> 00:18:42,463
Thanks for everything, things will get better.

195
00:18:43,838 --> 00:18:46,588
Take it yourself, it's in the fridge.

196
00:18:46,713 --> 00:18:49,297
take what? I am thanking you.

197
00:18:49,505 --> 00:18:50,463
Out of the way!

198
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,047
I said it's in the fridge.

199
00:18:55,422 --> 00:18:57,380
Not good... we're not good at all.

200
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:01,005
Have you been investigated?

201
00:19:04,463 --> 00:19:06,505
The case closed very well.

202
00:19:12,088 --> 00:19:14,422
He's an undercover specialist.

203
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:17,213
That is why it is perfect for this job.

204
00:19:19,005 --> 00:19:20,922
In any case, very good.

205
00:19:23,005 --> 00:19:27,422
Your task is to stay with the Korean detective 24/7,

206
00:19:29,172 --> 00:19:31,088
and report anything unusual.

207
00:19:35,213 --> 00:19:36,005
Of course.

208
00:19:38,005 --> 00:19:42,213
This is a covert and joint operation.

209
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,630
They must know that Intelligence is involved.

210
00:19:46,297 --> 00:19:48,838
Not only in the South, but in the North as well.

211
00:19:49,005 --> 00:19:50,922
Do you understand?

212
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:12,005
Find Cha and secure the plates.

213
00:20:12,172 --> 00:20:14,047
Did you learn to use this hand phone?

214
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,838
The south controls the people with this.

215
00:20:23,463 --> 00:20:25,005
You only have 3 days.

216
00:20:26,297 --> 00:20:29,005
First look for Park Myung-Ho.

217
00:20:29,297 --> 00:20:33,380
It was one of Cha's men, he's a smuggler in the south.

218
00:20:37,922 --> 00:20:39,797
Leave your personal Vendetta out of this.

219
00:20:41,005 --> 00:20:42,005
Do not forget.

220
00:21:03,172 --> 00:21:05,005
What a stallion...

221
00:21:17,713 --> 00:21:19,922
Aren't you the one with the Linm?

222
00:21:22,713 --> 00:21:24,088
I'm Kang Jin-tae from Homicide.

223
00:21:26,005 --> 00:21:28,880
The North's weapon is confiscated

224
00:21:31,088 --> 00:21:33,005
This is rule 1 of our joint work.

225
00:21:35,505 --> 00:21:38,005
They are the rules, and you must obey them.

226
00:21:40,713 --> 00:21:41,713
Come on.

227
00:21:56,297 --> 00:21:57,838
Eat something.

228
00:21:58,005 --> 00:22:00,672
Our taxes feed you to catch the criminal.

229
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,380
The south will assign you a snake.

230
00:22:06,922 --> 00:22:10,380
He can't know anything about the plates.

231
00:22:22,172 --> 00:22:24,255
I've been at this 20 years.

232
00:22:28,005 --> 00:22:31,005
I feel the weight on my shoulders.

233
00:22:36,047 --> 00:22:37,047
No...

234
00:22:38,005 --> 00:22:38,922
Sit down, sit down.

235
00:22:42,713 --> 00:22:47,088
Your job is to expect full cooperation.

236
00:22:47,838 --> 00:22:49,588
and drive away your detective.

237
00:22:52,005 --> 00:22:54,588
What brought you here?

238
00:22:54,797 --> 00:22:57,880
I have read the dossier on the case.

239
00:22:58,713 --> 00:23:03,088
An ordinary assassin wouldn't start a north-south meeting.

240
00:23:04,005 --> 00:23:08,088
Shouldn't they celebrate the arrest of a murderer?

241
00:23:11,005 --> 00:23:13,713
But do not have sense.

242
00:23:19,838 --> 00:23:21,005
Oh yeah?

243
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:29,005
That flag.

244
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,005
If you let it...

245
00:23:36,005 --> 00:23:40,005
Rule #2, this is an undercover case.

246
00:23:53,172 --> 00:23:55,005
very uncomfortable...

247
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,005
Look around.

248
00:23:57,213 --> 00:23:59,297
The south is full of CCTVs.

249
00:24:04,713 --> 00:24:06,172
So since...

250
00:24:06,588 --> 00:24:10,005
True, the north is always watched the same.

251
00:24:10,588 --> 00:24:12,255
I guess we are all the same.

252
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:18,380
It's too early for these pamphlets.

253
00:24:19,088 --> 00:24:20,672
Hey.

254
00:24:22,297 --> 00:24:24,713
Have you ever seen one of these?

255
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,422
Call them.

256
00:24:30,005 --> 00:24:31,005
Use this cell phone.

257
00:24:31,088 --> 00:24:34,088
My number is in favorites.

258
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:38,005
Oh really?

259
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:40,505
You can use this.

260
00:24:42,005 --> 00:24:43,422
Well, what's your number?

261
00:24:43,922 --> 00:24:44,838
Needless.

262
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:51,463
Bastard...

263
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,422
Take it when you come home.

264
00:25:01,505 --> 00:25:04,838
Anywhere you want to go? Seoul Tower or Itaewon?

265
00:25:04,922 --> 00:25:07,588
This may be your last time in Seoul.

266
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,005
Are you really a special investigator?

267
00:25:11,088 --> 00:25:14,005
Have you heard that? Yes why do you ask?

268
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:16,797
You sound more like a tour guide.

269
00:25:17,838 --> 00:25:20,088
Do you think I don't know how to investigate?

270
00:25:24,672 --> 00:25:27,088
My bosses are tracking Cha,

271
00:25:32,005 --> 00:25:35,005
Would you like to go shopping? Well why not.

272
00:25:47,088 --> 00:25:49,005
Weren't you better off as a soldier?

273
00:25:49,797 --> 00:25:50,880
Why police?

274
00:25:51,505 --> 00:25:53,005
Find another route, one without traffic.

275
00:25:54,463 --> 00:25:57,880
I wish I could, but there isn't.

276
00:26:00,838 --> 00:26:05,213
For a country without oil, why are there so many cars?

277
00:26:07,838 --> 00:26:09,922
Are the cops in the South all like that?

278
00:26:10,005 --> 00:26:13,422
Yielding to all the traffic, they play with the cell phone

279
00:26:16,005 --> 00:26:18,422
In Seoul there is no way to get out of the traffic.

280
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,005
That stare of yours...

281
00:26:25,713 --> 00:26:28,005
I better give in.

282
00:26:32,838 --> 00:26:35,838
Only ambulances can do that.

283
00:26:38,047 --> 00:26:39,713
What were you saying?

284
00:26:46,297 --> 00:26:49,047
We are partners, inform me.

285
00:26:53,255 --> 00:26:55,213
Daemyung Condominium, #1108.

286
00:26:56,172 --> 00:26:59,005
Sha's associate lives there.

287
00:27:00,255 --> 00:27:01,797
Park Myung-ho.

288
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:09,005
It's all I wanted to know.

289
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:14,213
Hostage situation in Mapo district.

290
00:27:14,505 --> 00:27:16,922
A man in his 40s holds a woman hostage with a knife.

291
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:21,922
What world do we live in?

292
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:27,672
D-1 is close, we'll go see.

293
00:27:28,505 --> 00:27:29,505
What are you doing?

294
00:27:29,713 --> 00:27:31,713
You heard the radio, there is a hostage.

295
00:27:32,005 --> 00:27:34,047
Have you forgotten your orders?

296
00:27:37,297 --> 00:27:40,005
The safety of a citizen is the first priority of a police officer.

297
00:27:40,047 --> 00:27:41,880
If we don't go, she could be hurt.

298
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,713
Enough of that garbage.

299
00:27:45,047 --> 00:27:46,588
Damn...

300
00:27:46,838 --> 00:27:49,005
You better let me go.

301
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:54,005
We're not that close for this level of intimacy.

302
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:56,838
Well, let's talk about it again.

303
00:27:58,463 --> 00:27:59,047
Come on!

304
00:27:59,422 --> 00:28:01,088
Curse!

305
00:28:04,463 --> 00:28:06,880
What do you take me for?

306
00:28:16,213 --> 00:28:17,672
You are making a big mistake.

307
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,005
Return that!

308
00:28:20,047 --> 00:28:21,047
It's okay, okay, okay.

309
00:28:21,505 --> 00:28:22,588
Truce, ceasefire.

310
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,172
Take them away from me and we talk like democratic people.

311
00:28:26,005 --> 00:28:28,005
CD as communists?

312
00:28:32,005 --> 00:28:35,005
Cheol-ryung, hey, listen to me.

313
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:36,713
¡Cheol-ryungg

314
00:28:37,005 --> 00:28:38,005
Hey! Hey!

315
00:28:45,422 --> 00:28:46,297
¡Lim enedEnNuUnc)!

316
00:28:47,797 --> 00:28:50,422
That's one crazy son of a bitch!

317
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,005
Even if he's Special Forces, this isn't the place.

318
00:28:56,297 --> 00:28:58,838
Det. Lee, I need to track down a taxi!

319
00:28:59,047 --> 00:29:01,297
19 m6918.

320
00:29:01,838 --> 00:29:04,005
Sixty-nine, damn eighteen.

321
00:29:33,922 --> 00:29:36,255
Daemyung Condominium.

322
00:29:42,005 --> 00:29:43,047
Hey!

323
00:29:49,005 --> 00:29:51,005
you arrived in one piece

324
00:29:51,047 --> 00:29:53,713
Detective, let's have a chat.

325
00:29:56,005 --> 00:29:58,005
Why are you so like that?

326
00:30:02,005 --> 00:30:03,005
We need to talk about...

327
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:32,005
stop Lee, Seoul 31SA 2914!

328
00:30:34,213 --> 00:30:36,797
call when you have it

329
00:30:42,005 --> 00:30:43,297
Made in the north?

330
00:30:45,588 --> 00:30:46,713
Como Bingdu.

331
00:30:46,922 --> 00:30:49,630
Asshole, either from China or North Korea

332
00:30:54,047 --> 00:30:57,005
It's not that fake shit you get here.

333
00:30:57,088 --> 00:31:00,922
This is authentic, genuine from North Korea.

334
00:31:01,005 --> 00:31:01,838
Look here.

335
00:31:02,005 --> 00:31:04,213
You've lived long with fake shit.

336
00:31:05,422 --> 00:31:09,172
The dirty, ragged deserter is getting bigger.

337
00:31:09,922 --> 00:31:11,505
You're just a junkie hunter.

338
00:31:13,088 --> 00:31:15,172
Give it to him.

339
00:31:19,005 --> 00:31:21,797
Fool.

340
00:31:24,005 --> 00:31:25,005
Oh yeah.

341
00:31:26,922 --> 00:31:29,088
Let me know if you are in the market for these.

342
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,005
I don't just deal drugs.

343
00:31:44,797 --> 00:31:45,797
Park myung-ho.

344
00:31:48,213 --> 00:31:49,172
Where is Cha Gi-Sung?

345
00:31:53,213 --> 00:31:54,297
My arm!

346
00:31:58,213 --> 00:31:59,213
Who are you?

347
00:31:59,838 --> 00:32:01,005
Don't you think I use it?

348
00:32:01,505 --> 00:32:02,588
I'll blow your head off.

349
00:32:11,005 --> 00:32:12,005
¡Lim enedEnNuUnc)!

350
00:33:14,422 --> 00:33:16,880
- Where? - Ltaewon!

351
00:34:28,172 --> 00:34:29,838
It's dangerous, go inside!

352
00:34:33,005 --> 00:34:34,297
' ¡HaWOUngl
' ¡Papi! '

353
00:34:35,088 --> 00:34:36,088
Come here!

354
00:34:45,005 --> 00:34:46,005
¡Ha-young!

355
00:34:46,422 --> 00:34:48,213
' Are you OK? - Daddy!

356
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,172
Look at this...

357
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,005
¡Lim enedEnNuUnc)!

358
00:35:04,005 --> 00:35:05,172
Wait!

359
00:35:06,172 --> 00:35:07,172
Curse!

360
00:35:18,172 --> 00:35:19,463
I have a clue

361
00:35:22,255 --> 00:35:26,880
Dalian a257 on 18th street under the alias 'Hwang Wui-Wan.'

362
00:35:28,005 --> 00:35:30,255
Look for the nearest door.

363
00:35:40,172 --> 00:35:41,505
Investigate the owner of the car.

364
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:42,838
Yes sir-.

365
00:36:10,713 --> 00:36:12,588
Park is here, sir.

366
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,713
Park Myung-ho reporting.

367
00:36:15,005 --> 00:36:17,380
You do not get tired? Leave that greeting.

368
00:36:18,005 --> 00:36:20,005
Is a free country.

369
00:36:21,088 --> 00:36:23,047
The ship and weapons will be ready tomorrow.

370
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,422
Good.

371
00:36:25,005 --> 00:36:27,213
But we have a problem.

372
00:36:28,005 --> 00:36:32,005
He must come from the homeland, he is looking for you.

373
00:36:32,922 --> 00:36:34,422
It's probably from unit #5014.

374
00:36:36,005 --> 00:36:37,005
There are two of them.

375
00:36:51,797 --> 00:36:52,963
Have you gone mad?! You've gone mad?!

376
00:36:53,005 --> 00:36:55,338
Why don't you yell at everyone that you're undercover?

377
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,422
I could have died!

378
00:36:57,922 --> 00:37:00,713
When I found Lim, he looked like he was in an action movie.

379
00:37:07,505 --> 00:37:10,005
He fled, he was long gone.

380
00:37:11,005 --> 00:37:13,672
Did you let it get away? Didn't you question him?

381
00:37:14,005 --> 00:37:15,922
Did you want me to?

382
00:37:16,463 --> 00:37:17,922
I can not believe it...

383
00:37:19,713 --> 00:37:22,588
We have Cha Gi-sung's file.

384
00:37:25,047 --> 00:37:29,213
Stay with Lim 24/7, don't let him cause trouble.

385
00:37:30,213 --> 00:37:32,838
That's a little too much...

386
00:37:35,005 --> 00:37:38,588
This could be the exile of a VIP.

387
00:37:43,422 --> 00:37:45,422
And kill him while they work together?

388
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:47,172
We would be screwed.

389
00:37:52,922 --> 00:37:54,005
Did you give him the phone?

390
00:37:55,005 --> 00:37:56,005
You want to use yours.

391
00:38:00,255 --> 00:38:01,588
That?

392
00:38:04,005 --> 00:38:08,630
You know we'll track it down! Do you want me to force it?

393
00:38:11,005 --> 00:38:12,297
Curse...

394
00:38:14,047 --> 00:38:15,047
Where is Lim?

395
00:38:20,088 --> 00:38:21,713
The. Glue?

396
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,172
I'm the detective Lee Dong-hoon.

397
00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:28,005
I'm the detective's partner. Kang.

398
00:38:28,922 --> 00:38:31,713
In other words, we are on the same team.

399
00:38:33,005 --> 00:38:34,380
Nice to meet you.

400
00:38:35,922 --> 00:38:40,297
Our countries may be divided, but we share the same blood.

401
00:38:40,838 --> 00:38:43,505
As a joint team, we can figure this out very well...

402
00:38:47,005 --> 00:38:48,922
- Nothing to report. - Don't tell me, how strange.

403
00:38:50,005 --> 00:38:51,047
God.

404
00:38:51,172 --> 00:38:52,672
Let's go out.

405
00:38:53,463 --> 00:38:54,630
Come.

406
00:38:57,422 --> 00:39:00,838
Park is missing, and there's no lead on Cha.

407
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,505
Will you go knocking door to door?

408
00:39:13,672 --> 00:39:14,713
Here

409
00:39:15,047 --> 00:39:18,505
You lost the suspect and terrorized the streets.

410
00:39:32,005 --> 00:39:33,005
Your legs, please.

411
00:39:33,172 --> 00:39:36,588
I'll jump, move your legs.

412
00:39:41,005 --> 00:39:42,088
open them up a bit...

413
00:39:44,672 --> 00:39:45,713
Legs together...

414
00:39:57,005 --> 00:39:57,922
Wait...

415
00:40:04,713 --> 00:40:06,047
my goodness...

416
00:40:06,463 --> 00:40:09,672
When will this day end?

417
00:40:14,005 --> 00:40:18,005
Detective, this is hard for me too.

418
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:21,088
Can't we trust each other?

419
00:40:26,172 --> 00:40:28,172
We can triangulate it fast.

420
00:40:28,588 --> 00:40:32,255
Don't underestimate the power of our reach.

421
00:40:36,297 --> 00:40:37,380
if you do that,

422
00:40:39,005 --> 00:40:41,088
I will follow the investigation rules of South Korea.

423
00:40:43,088 --> 00:40:44,797
I will do that.

424
00:40:46,005 --> 00:40:47,005
Take them off.

425
00:40:48,255 --> 00:40:50,005
And what do you go on your own?

426
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:51,797
I want to trust our joint mission.

427
00:40:55,005 --> 00:40:59,047
I got a lot of shit from above because of you.

428
00:40:59,713 --> 00:41:02,672
Let's drop the formalities.

429
00:41:08,172 --> 00:41:12,005
I usually share a drink and we become friends.

430
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,255
Good.

431
00:41:19,088 --> 00:41:20,505
Very good,

432
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,380
To celebrate our new friendship, here.

433
00:41:26,047 --> 00:41:27,213
Show me your leg.

434
00:41:30,505 --> 00:41:31,505
Very good

435
00:41:33,713 --> 00:41:35,172
This device is...

436
00:41:36,213 --> 00:41:40,297
It's a discreet sign that you're a detective here.

437
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,047
Not a gps tracker?

438
00:41:45,255 --> 00:41:47,463
It has that little function.

439
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:50,005
As I explain?

440
00:41:51,505 --> 00:41:53,047
Let's say you arrive at a crime scene.

441
00:41:53,088 --> 00:41:55,213
You cannot know who is who.

442
00:42:04,005 --> 00:42:05,463
"Are you a detective?"

443
00:42:05,797 --> 00:42:07,422
"Yes I am. And you?".

444
00:42:09,172 --> 00:42:12,005
Are you a detective too? Great job here."

445
00:42:14,588 --> 00:42:16,880
That's what it stands for, okay?

446
00:42:20,505 --> 00:42:23,713
Is loading. I take it every day.

447
00:42:26,255 --> 00:42:29,005
I accept happily, thank you.

448
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,838
- Take a drink. - I'm fine.

449
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,005
Just one drink.

450
00:42:39,005 --> 00:42:43,213
Since we're on this mission, it's the end of the bad guys.

451
00:42:44,297 --> 00:42:48,172
If I catch Cha, what will you do for me?

452
00:42:50,088 --> 00:42:53,005
Let me think, anything?

453
00:42:56,213 --> 00:43:00,838
I can send the girl to a private school, marry off my sister-in-law,

454
00:43:01,713 --> 00:43:04,713
and give the rest to my wife

455
00:43:09,005 --> 00:43:13,463
That's cheap for enslaving a redneck cop for 3 days.

456
00:43:15,005 --> 00:43:17,505
Do you know what my salary is?

457
00:43:18,005 --> 00:43:20,713
You will be surprised to hear it.

458
00:43:21,797 --> 00:43:26,172
Taxes paid, about 838,000.

459
00:43:27,213 --> 00:43:30,422
Divide that by 12,

460
00:43:30,922 --> 00:43:33,005
and gives about 83,000.

461
00:43:36,672 --> 00:43:41,047
Curse! Almost minimum wage!

462
00:43:46,005 --> 00:43:47,880
Honey, we have a guest

463
00:43:54,463 --> 00:43:56,630
He doesn't have a room yet.

464
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:05,172
So he brought fried chicken.

465
00:44:06,005 --> 00:44:07,463
This is my wife!

466
00:44:07,588 --> 00:44:09,463
And my princess.

467
00:44:10,838 --> 00:44:13,005
How was your day?

468
00:44:18,713 --> 00:44:21,005
Say hello to Mr. Lim.

469
00:44:24,005 --> 00:44:26,172
- Hello. - What is this?

470
00:44:29,005 --> 00:44:31,297
Silly. And resume!

471
00:44:41,588 --> 00:44:44,005
Come in, come in!

472
00:44:45,797 --> 00:44:47,213
This is how we live.

473
00:44:50,297 --> 00:44:52,005
Who says?!

474
00:44:56,297 --> 00:44:59,838
He has a sharp tongue, but he is kind.

475
00:45:01,297 --> 00:45:04,588
I wouldn't have invited you, if it weren't so.

476
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:20,422
He is so handsome...

477
00:45:21,005 --> 00:45:22,005
Is it in there?

478
00:45:23,088 --> 00:45:24,380
Yes, why?

479
00:45:27,047 --> 00:45:28,047
That? what?!

480
00:45:30,422 --> 00:45:31,922
It won't stay in the main room!

481
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:04,255
You can sleep here, it's Yeon-Ah's room.

482
00:46:05,005 --> 00:46:07,005
I hope it's not too uncomfortable.

483
00:46:11,005 --> 00:46:15,005
This is my room.

484
00:46:17,588 --> 00:46:18,713
Have a good night.

485
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,630
Once we locate Cha,

486
00:46:57,463 --> 00:47:01,005
I hope you like it, I made it for you.

487
00:47:01,838 --> 00:47:03,005
Please try it.

488
00:47:04,005 --> 00:47:06,005
Do you have any preference?

489
00:47:12,255 --> 00:47:15,672
I have never seen you cook in these three years.

490
00:47:16,005 --> 00:47:17,172
It's a guest, sister.

491
00:47:17,422 --> 00:47:19,422
I hope it is to your liking.

492
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:24,880
North Korea?

493
00:47:27,672 --> 00:47:32,047
He deserted because it is difficult to live there.

494
00:47:32,588 --> 00:47:34,838
He's a North Korean policeman, be nice to him.

495
00:47:42,047 --> 00:47:44,047
Good girl.

496
00:47:45,588 --> 00:47:49,005
Hey? .5 c S for him?

497
00:47:51,005 --> 00:47:52,838
It would be nice if you gave me a little too.

498
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:56,213
Please start.

499
00:47:57,255 --> 00:47:59,797
There's no need to spin around

500
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:06,088
Who starves these days.

501
00:48:06,255 --> 00:48:09,005
Go read some newspapers.

502
00:48:09,297 --> 00:48:11,005
There are plenty.

503
00:48:13,713 --> 00:48:14,838
That?

504
00:48:26,255 --> 00:48:29,922
She's not one to starve, look at her flawless skin.

505
00:48:34,422 --> 00:48:37,005
Stop looking at him, eat your breakfast.

506
00:48:38,713 --> 00:48:40,213
- Please eat. - We have to go.

507
00:48:42,047 --> 00:48:43,047
His grave.

508
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:47,172
My wife is a great cook.

509
00:48:47,713 --> 00:48:49,672
Boss, we have the owner of the car.

510
00:49:05,047 --> 00:49:07,380
Put our men on '(with and Aang.

511
00:49:07,588 --> 00:49:10,005
Report when they contact Cha.

512
00:49:20,672 --> 00:49:23,005
How about the free life?

513
00:49:25,005 --> 00:49:27,838
I sleep and eat well like a free man.

514
00:49:28,422 --> 00:49:31,630
If you have money, freedom can be easily bought.

515
00:49:32,797 --> 00:49:37,005
Left and right do not really exist.

516
00:49:49,713 --> 00:49:51,588
Come on, that doesn't prove shit.

517
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,713
I have to see them plates printing the money.

518
00:49:54,088 --> 00:49:56,922
We are not negotiating a negligible sum.

519
00:49:58,088 --> 00:50:00,255
Let's see what those boards can do.

520
00:50:00,422 --> 00:50:03,922
We have to make sure it's authentic.

521
00:50:04,005 --> 00:50:05,713
What do you take me for?

522
00:50:06,005 --> 00:50:08,838
Detection of counterfeit money is quite advanced.

523
00:50:09,672 --> 00:50:12,713
We need specialists and equipment too.

524
00:50:15,005 --> 00:50:16,797
I only need 2 days.

525
00:50:17,088 --> 00:50:20,005
Whether we verify it or not is up to you.

526
00:50:20,213 --> 00:50:23,422
But if the deal closes, that's on me.

527
00:50:23,922 --> 00:50:25,630
You have balls.

528
00:50:27,297 --> 00:50:28,672
Motherfucker.

529
00:50:36,463 --> 00:50:37,588
Mr Yoon.

530
00:50:38,422 --> 00:50:40,505
I have betrayed my country

531
00:50:40,797 --> 00:50:45,005
to my family, and to my youth for those plaques.

532
00:50:46,838 --> 00:50:50,005
Do you want my organs too?

533
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:53,588
You worked so hard, you deserve to get paid.

534
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:58,380
Anyway, I'm the only one who has the resources.

535
00:51:00,005 --> 00:51:01,463
Correct.

536
00:51:03,297 --> 00:51:05,630
Then I will wait.

537
00:51:11,838 --> 00:51:14,713
We'll meet here tomorrow with the plates.

538
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,922
Very wise.

539
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,713
If you want to fuck me, I'll kill you.

540
00:51:26,505 --> 00:51:28,297
Rewind please.

541
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:29,297
High!

542
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:33,297
To the basement.

543
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,255
What is there?

544
00:51:38,005 --> 00:51:39,463
- Tax free? - Yeah.

545
00:51:41,463 --> 00:51:45,005
We can't break in without evidence.

546
00:51:45,463 --> 00:51:47,797
Park carries a different bag.

547
00:51:51,422 --> 00:51:52,422
That?

548
00:52:01,005 --> 00:52:05,005
In the South, suspects are innocent until proven guilty.

549
00:52:14,505 --> 00:52:19,005
So it's up to me to do things right.

550
00:52:20,922 --> 00:52:22,922
Good day.

551
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:29,255
We are here for Park Myung-ho, he was here yesterday around 3 pm

552
00:52:30,922 --> 00:52:34,005
The one with the big head and dirty hair.

553
00:52:35,088 --> 00:52:39,088
We saw it on the security cameras, so don't pretend...

554
00:52:40,047 --> 00:52:41,255
Why are you here?

555
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:42,380
Buddy!

556
00:52:42,713 --> 00:52:45,297
Swordsman, you know me, come here.

557
00:52:48,005 --> 00:52:49,630
Come back, idiot!

558
00:52:49,713 --> 00:52:51,005
Boss, this is bad!

559
00:53:02,255 --> 00:53:04,088
What is happening here?

560
00:53:10,588 --> 00:53:13,005
And who are you?

561
00:53:13,463 --> 00:53:15,297
Are you the boss here?

562
00:53:16,088 --> 00:53:18,922
I would like to ask for your cooperation.

563
00:53:19,463 --> 00:53:21,172
Do you know Park Myung-ho?

564
00:53:22,005 --> 00:53:23,463
Did you bring an order?

565
00:53:24,005 --> 00:53:27,005
It is being sent by mail, but we can talk.

566
00:53:27,213 --> 00:53:30,172
Did you skip the process and come without one?

567
00:53:30,797 --> 00:53:33,922
You have shit for common sense.

568
00:53:35,588 --> 00:53:39,005
Are we seriously going to start off on the wrong foot?

569
00:53:40,797 --> 00:53:43,797
Do I deserve this kind of treatment?

570
00:53:46,922 --> 00:53:47,797
This is real?

571
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:52,088
Give it to me, idiot!

572
00:53:59,172 --> 00:54:00,463
Where is Park?

573
00:54:05,838 --> 00:54:09,172
Those are bad manners.

574
00:54:12,005 --> 00:54:14,713
Obstruction of justice is an applicable law.

575
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:20,922
We will take the appropriate measures.

576
00:54:23,713 --> 00:54:24,713
Boss!

577
00:54:26,088 --> 00:54:27,172
A detective

578
00:54:31,255 --> 00:54:33,463
You must treat it accordingly.

579
00:55:22,588 --> 00:55:24,005
Bastards...

580
00:55:28,005 --> 00:55:29,588
IS it toilet paper?

581
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:32,255
At home, toilet paper is not a weapon.

582
00:55:33,005 --> 00:55:37,422
No one will see it as such here either.

583
00:55:39,172 --> 00:55:41,005
How did you do it...

584
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:44,672
They came to me, it was in self defense.

585
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:51,297
Park's number is here, trace his location.

586
00:55:57,005 --> 00:55:58,088
Boss.

587
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:01,797
Can you get me off this mission?

588
00:56:05,297 --> 00:56:09,255
Lim knocked out a group of thugs

589
00:56:14,588 --> 00:56:15,672
That?

590
00:56:17,172 --> 00:56:18,297
The triad?

591
00:56:18,505 --> 00:56:22,630
The DS Fund is a corporate gang,

592
00:56:23,005 --> 00:56:27,172
and Cha was in contact with them after arriving here.

593
00:56:27,463 --> 00:56:29,005
- Oh really? - Yeah.

594
00:56:30,047 --> 00:56:33,380
Did you plant the chip in Lim's cell phone?

595
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,297
I did it.

596
00:56:38,672 --> 00:56:40,505
How could I know?

597
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:45,005
Jin-tae.

598
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:47,505
let's figure this out first

599
00:57:02,297 --> 00:57:04,880
Okay, listen, I've got Park's location.

600
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:06,672
Yeongdeungpo District, 66 dosin St.

601
00:57:15,005 --> 00:57:19,588
Due to the low unemployment rate, the youngest depend on...

602
00:57:19,797 --> 00:57:21,797
Sister, what is Jin-tae's salary?

603
00:57:23,838 --> 00:57:27,422
After taxes and insurance, just over 830,000.

604
00:57:35,047 --> 00:57:38,922
Career men with 3,100,000 salary line up behind me,

605
00:57:39,088 --> 00:57:43,713
It's a step backwards to marry a policeman with 330,000

606
00:57:44,713 --> 00:57:46,505
A significant discount, right?

607
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:48,797
He proposed to you?

608
00:57:48,838 --> 00:57:51,005
If I want it will.

609
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,672
And?

610
00:57:54,922 --> 00:57:57,005
You are just a profiteer.

611
00:57:57,255 --> 00:57:59,005
Where did you get that dress from before?

612
00:57:59,172 --> 00:58:02,005
I lost count because of you!

613
00:58:08,005 --> 00:58:11,172
So why does he have to be so handsome? I can not decide.

614
00:58:11,588 --> 00:58:13,005
Why do you get carried away by the look?

615
00:58:17,088 --> 00:58:21,172
I was also surprised, fatal, right?

616
00:58:22,005 --> 00:58:23,880
Totally fatal.

617
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:30,213
Their reckless fight was...

618
00:58:32,588 --> 00:58:33,838
Sister, sister!

619
00:58:34,047 --> 00:58:35,297
Isn't that CheoHyung?

620
00:58:37,297 --> 00:58:39,255
Even engaging in a fist fight...

621
00:58:41,922 --> 00:58:45,422
My God! It just can't be!

622
00:58:58,713 --> 00:59:01,172
The cartridge does not fit correctly.

623
00:59:01,588 --> 00:59:03,005
Please wait here.

624
00:59:06,005 --> 00:59:08,047
No way, how could I trust...

625
00:59:12,672 --> 00:59:14,588
Curse...

626
00:59:16,213 --> 00:59:18,172
It's not that I don't trust you

627
00:59:27,505 --> 00:59:29,005
Welcome.

628
00:59:29,505 --> 00:59:31,005
Hello.

629
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:48,463
It is this?

630
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:52,713
What is this place?

631
00:59:55,672 --> 00:59:58,255
Damn enlarged...

632
00:59:58,838 --> 01:00:00,422
What is this place?

633
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:20,422
- Let's move. - Lieutenant.

634
01:00:23,713 --> 01:00:26,922
Can't I live here in the south forever?

635
01:00:28,505 --> 01:00:32,047
I made all the preparations, got the weapons and the ship.

636
01:00:33,297 --> 01:00:36,588
I don't need my payment

637
01:00:37,005 --> 01:00:40,380
so please tell the captain for me.

638
01:00:54,672 --> 01:00:55,922
Hey!

639
01:00:58,005 --> 01:00:59,047
Who are you?

640
01:01:00,005 --> 01:01:01,005
That?

641
01:01:01,838 --> 01:01:03,588
Who are you?

642
01:01:05,588 --> 01:01:08,505
Are you the boss here? Who are you?

643
01:01:19,255 --> 01:01:21,005
Look at these guys...

644
01:01:27,005 --> 01:01:28,922
Hey cheol-ryung!

645
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:30,880
¡Cheol-ryungg

646
01:01:31,005 --> 01:01:32,005
¡Cheol-ryungg

647
01:01:36,505 --> 01:01:37,505
Damn...

648
01:01:38,172 --> 01:01:39,297
Wait wait!

649
01:01:50,505 --> 01:01:52,588
Do you have a death wish?!

650
01:01:55,297 --> 01:01:56,630
How did that?

651
01:02:03,005 --> 01:02:04,005
Shit!

652
01:02:19,005 --> 01:02:20,380
Come here!

653
01:02:25,797 --> 01:02:28,172
I can't risk a betrayal

654
01:02:30,088 --> 01:02:31,172
Please...

655
01:02:43,047 --> 01:02:45,005
I took care of Park.

656
01:02:45,088 --> 01:02:46,213
2Y Lin?

657
01:02:51,047 --> 01:02:53,005
Talking about the devil.

658
01:02:53,922 --> 01:02:55,172
Comrade, answer

659
01:03:02,713 --> 01:03:04,213
¿¿Cneowsyung ?

660
01:03:07,922 --> 01:03:11,463
You should have let it go, when I forgave you.

661
01:03:13,005 --> 01:03:17,588
I left you alive because we went through a lot together.

662
01:03:18,713 --> 01:03:21,005
But you come to catch me?

663
01:03:23,630 --> 01:03:24,838
Shut up and wait.

664
01:03:28,797 --> 01:03:31,255
You're with one foot on the grave

665
01:03:32,088 --> 01:03:34,213
It's not my fault, rest in peace.

666
01:04:19,005 --> 01:04:20,005
¡Cheol-ryungg

667
01:04:40,713 --> 01:04:43,005
Who was that bastard?

668
01:04:48,213 --> 01:04:50,255
Secure first and second floor!

669
01:04:52,005 --> 01:04:53,172
How he died?

670
01:04:53,838 --> 01:04:58,088
Evidence and warrants are useless now.

671
01:05:00,505 --> 01:05:01,505
Did they shoot you?

672
01:05:01,838 --> 01:05:05,505
Like hell, they almost killed me.

673
01:05:07,047 --> 01:05:11,005
Shit, they cut me off.

674
01:05:17,005 --> 01:05:19,005
Move over, please.

675
01:05:22,422 --> 01:05:24,505
What is all this?

676
01:05:25,797 --> 01:05:26,838
Where is Kang Jin-tae?

677
01:05:28,005 --> 01:05:29,005
In it. Kang!

678
01:05:29,922 --> 01:05:31,172
What's that? That...

679
01:05:33,422 --> 01:05:35,047
- Boss! " 'Come here!

680
01:05:35,713 --> 01:05:37,797
Come here, fool!

681
01:05:39,005 --> 01:05:43,172
This is a sting operation.

682
01:05:50,088 --> 01:05:51,672
Listen.

683
01:05:52,005 --> 01:05:54,838
I will report this situation to the boss myself.

684
01:05:58,588 --> 01:06:00,588
This is Park's cell phone.

685
01:06:00,922 --> 01:06:03,463
Extracts all locations from the last 4 days.

686
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:08,838
It's okay, undercover...

687
01:06:09,297 --> 01:06:10,880
Come on.

688
01:06:11,172 --> 01:06:12,505
In it. Kang!

689
01:06:13,505 --> 01:06:15,380
- Blood! - It's okay, I'll be fine.

690
01:06:28,922 --> 01:06:31,380
How will I tell my wife about this?

691
01:06:36,005 --> 01:06:37,005
Are you OK?

692
01:06:37,713 --> 01:06:40,713
Of course not, it hurts like a bitch.

693
01:06:42,005 --> 01:06:44,172
How could you do that to me?

694
01:06:44,463 --> 01:06:48,088
They were coming for me, and you left without telling me.

695
01:06:50,297 --> 01:06:53,088
I'm disappointed, you fucking disloyal.

696
01:06:55,005 --> 01:06:58,463
Anyway, that big guy who killed Park,

697
01:07:04,713 --> 01:07:06,005
Curse...

698
01:07:06,797 --> 01:07:11,172
If I ask you something, answer me for once!

699
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:17,213
Forget it! Whatever you want!

700
01:07:17,463 --> 01:07:18,880
Damn this joint mission.

701
01:07:20,463 --> 01:07:22,630
You probably know that Cha was a soldier.

702
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,422
How many men do you have?

703
01:07:26,005 --> 01:07:27,005
Don't know.

704
01:07:28,005 --> 01:07:31,005
His squad consisted of a dozen men,

705
01:07:32,588 --> 01:07:35,005
And if his mercenaries got involved...

706
01:07:40,088 --> 01:07:41,505
Lim Cheol Ryung.

707
01:07:44,838 --> 01:07:49,047
What the hell is going on here in the south?

708
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:54,463
Why would an officer from the north come here with his men?

709
01:07:56,588 --> 01:08:00,172
I tell you everything, but you don't.

710
01:08:05,672 --> 01:08:07,880
Who is Cha and why is he here?

711
01:08:13,088 --> 01:08:16,213
Long ago, he killed a squad of censors.

712
01:08:18,005 --> 01:08:19,088
AND?

713
01:08:22,005 --> 01:08:23,713
They were like my family.

714
01:08:24,005 --> 01:08:26,172
The men in the photo...

715
01:08:26,797 --> 01:08:28,797
We were supposed to wait

716
01:08:32,588 --> 01:08:34,213
but because of me...

717
01:08:34,797 --> 01:08:36,255
Because of your fault?

718
01:08:39,005 --> 01:08:42,838
As if terrorizing the streets wasn't enough, murder?

719
01:08:45,797 --> 01:08:48,463
We didn't do it. it wasn't us

720
01:08:56,088 --> 01:08:58,047
Well, if it wasn't you, then who?

721
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:01,005
Cha is not alone, he has soldiers.

722
01:09:09,713 --> 01:09:11,630
Yeah.

723
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:14,005
What is Cha's ultimate goal?

724
01:09:16,005 --> 01:09:19,213
How could I not know? Do more intelligence.

725
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:24,005
I'm not a fucking vampire!

726
01:09:42,588 --> 01:09:44,255
What is your area of ​​specialization?

727
01:09:45,213 --> 01:09:46,672
Violence...

728
01:09:47,588 --> 01:09:49,880
I see, masochism.

729
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:52,880
The girls are mine.

730
01:09:56,588 --> 01:10:01,005
Do you want to know how to free yourself from the anklet?

731
01:10:05,005 --> 01:10:07,713
Aid! Please!

732
01:10:12,588 --> 01:10:14,213
He must be a cop too.

733
01:10:21,047 --> 01:10:22,172
Damn...

734
01:10:23,838 --> 01:10:25,463
You said you weren't hiding anything from me.

735
01:10:28,588 --> 01:10:30,005
You did not want to accept my cell phone,

736
01:10:32,797 --> 01:10:36,255
What if you get into trouble in a foreign country?

737
01:10:40,463 --> 01:10:41,838
Listen.

738
01:10:42,463 --> 01:10:43,713
I can't seem to cut it.

739
01:10:45,422 --> 01:10:47,047
Alright, I'll try again.

740
01:10:47,672 --> 01:10:51,005
Anything can be cut.

741
01:10:53,005 --> 01:10:55,005
Here we go! Let's see!

742
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:57,088
I have it!

743
01:10:57,380 --> 01:10:59,713
I could barely cut this thing.

744
01:11:00,255 --> 01:11:04,463
I have to return it, idiot!

745
01:11:04,797 --> 01:11:06,838
Oh my gosh, that was close.

746
01:11:07,005 --> 01:11:09,005
Where are you going?!

747
01:11:15,630 --> 01:11:17,797
Who kicked your ass?

748
01:11:22,005 --> 01:11:25,005
Stop! That is enough. It's just a bruise.

749
01:11:27,630 --> 01:11:30,005
Idiot!

750
01:11:31,797 --> 01:11:33,088
Oh really...

751
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:37,380
You pinched me very hard.

752
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:41,713
give me face

753
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,213
Come here!

754
01:11:50,005 --> 01:11:54,005
If you get stabbed again, we're done.

755
01:11:54,172 --> 01:11:57,005
So I'm not going around getting stabbed.

756
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:59,505
Hey.

757
01:12:00,005 --> 01:12:01,588
Why did they hit you?

758
01:12:14,005 --> 01:12:15,255
Mister.

759
01:12:15,672 --> 01:12:18,797
You are a policeman like dad, right?

760
01:12:19,588 --> 01:12:21,922
must fight very well

761
01:12:22,005 --> 01:12:26,588
Does he shoot bad people with guns like him?

762
01:12:27,047 --> 01:12:28,047
That's how it is

763
01:12:28,588 --> 01:12:29,588
take it off

764
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:33,880
That?

765
01:12:35,422 --> 01:12:37,005
I mean, roll up your sleeve.

766
01:12:38,713 --> 01:12:39,713
There's no need.

767
01:12:41,922 --> 01:12:43,713
It looks bad...

768
01:12:43,922 --> 01:12:46,005
How can you say that with those hands?

769
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:51,255
Your salary is low, but I hate to see you hurt.

770
01:12:52,463 --> 01:12:54,922
If you were to get married, would you live in the South?

771
01:12:55,047 --> 01:12:58,047
I'm sure you don't have much, but I'll skip that.

772
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:02,005
I have a girl.

773
01:13:05,005 --> 01:13:07,463
Why do not you tell me before?

774
01:13:08,005 --> 01:13:09,005
My God...

775
01:13:09,505 --> 01:13:11,213
How embarrassing!

776
01:13:13,005 --> 01:13:14,797
I'm sorry.

777
01:13:41,255 --> 01:13:43,630
You love her?

778
01:13:56,213 --> 01:13:59,213
Of course I love her.

779
01:14:00,630 --> 01:14:01,505
Come on...

780
01:14:18,047 --> 01:14:20,380
They were like my family.

781
01:14:21,005 --> 01:14:24,588
We were supposed to wait, but because of me...

782
01:14:27,005 --> 01:14:29,005
Think it's so cool...

783
01:14:39,922 --> 01:14:42,088
«Park Myung-ho».

784
01:15:01,838 --> 01:15:03,172
Good job

785
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:07,380
I will reward you all for your contribution.

786
01:15:08,005 --> 01:15:12,047
Once we complete this mission, we will achieve freedom forever.

787
01:15:13,047 --> 01:15:15,005
Fight to the death.

788
01:15:16,213 --> 01:15:17,713
We have something

789
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:20,297
It's coming from Park's body.

790
01:15:22,505 --> 01:15:26,838
After 3 days of ministerial talk, the northern delegation is returning...

791
01:15:29,838 --> 01:15:30,838
You scared me.

792
01:15:31,005 --> 01:15:33,172
Have you been able to sleep?

793
01:15:36,297 --> 01:15:37,880
Do you only have one suit?

794
01:15:44,463 --> 01:15:46,797
Come here!

795
01:15:47,630 --> 01:15:49,672
Park's phone was recovered, let's do it.

796
01:15:55,005 --> 01:15:56,005
So make it quick!

797
01:15:56,713 --> 01:15:58,172
Damn...

798
01:16:09,005 --> 01:16:10,672
What about food out of season?

799
01:16:12,172 --> 01:16:14,255
This doesn't seem normal.

800
01:16:14,922 --> 01:16:16,672
It's the North Korean style.

801
01:16:17,213 --> 01:16:20,213
North Korea? For him?

802
01:16:26,422 --> 01:16:29,297
- Come on, eat. - I hope you like it.

803
01:16:32,255 --> 01:16:36,880
I looked up the recipe online and made it myself.

804
01:16:38,047 --> 01:16:39,422
- Oh really? - You like me?

805
01:16:40,213 --> 01:16:41,005
It's great.

806
01:16:45,297 --> 01:16:47,297
Aunt, mom did that.

807
01:16:47,922 --> 01:16:48,713
Hey!

808
01:16:52,213 --> 01:16:54,005
Want something?

809
01:16:56,255 --> 01:16:59,005
It's uncomfortable, sit in your seat.

810
01:17:01,297 --> 01:17:02,505
' Bam? ' Yes ​​baby?

811
01:17:04,463 --> 01:17:06,005
- I'll buy it. - When?

812
01:17:17,088 --> 01:17:19,630
"Boss Pyo: Your cell phone is bugged."

813
01:17:27,005 --> 01:17:28,005
Alright?

814
01:17:33,172 --> 01:17:35,630
Have you not finished.

815
01:17:36,713 --> 01:17:37,713
Finish your food.

816
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,880
It's okay, please.

817
01:17:50,422 --> 01:17:54,005
Wait wait!

818
01:17:54,297 --> 01:17:55,422
Wait!

819
01:17:57,005 --> 01:18:00,255
Can I be informal with you?

820
01:18:01,005 --> 01:18:02,172
You already are.

821
01:18:02,838 --> 01:18:05,005
Oh yeah?

822
01:18:07,088 --> 01:18:11,713
I don't know what you do to come back with so many bruises

823
01:18:13,005 --> 01:18:15,588
And I know you won't tell me

824
01:18:18,505 --> 01:18:20,672
Please take care of my husband.

825
01:18:21,005 --> 01:18:24,005
He's stubborn, so my scolding doesn't work.

826
01:18:24,588 --> 01:18:28,672
Take the hard work for yourself.

827
01:18:29,005 --> 01:18:31,255
You're still single, so maybe you don't understand...

828
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:40,005
There must be someone, I'm sure.

829
01:18:40,838 --> 01:18:44,213
Anyway, take care of it.

830
01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:49,672
He may be a jerk, but he's all I've got.

831
01:18:51,505 --> 01:18:53,005
I understand

832
01:19:04,088 --> 01:19:08,005
It is called 'super ticket', the plates can print counterfeit money,

833
01:19:14,672 --> 01:19:16,422
Did you track down Cha's location?

834
01:19:17,630 --> 01:19:19,005
Not yet

835
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:22,005
- Park's phone... - Tell me, I know you know.

836
01:19:26,005 --> 01:19:27,005
Are you going to hit me?

837
01:19:32,838 --> 01:19:34,713
- Tell me. - Don't know!

838
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:36,672
Even if I did know, I wouldn't tell you, asshole.

839
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:41,713
No wonder, my grandfather always said,

840
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:46,505
You couldn't be trusted, even back then.

841
01:19:46,672 --> 01:19:49,880
The third generation under the dictatorship really screwed things up more.

842
01:19:50,005 --> 01:19:52,172
They are starving people to death.

843
01:19:53,047 --> 01:19:57,005
The rich get richer, the poor get poorer.

844
01:19:57,838 --> 01:19:59,630
Do you know what the debt of the South is?

845
01:20:08,838 --> 01:20:10,172
That's a lot of bullshit.

846
01:20:11,172 --> 01:20:15,172
Is it fair for your leader to burn the cash instead of helping?

847
01:20:15,588 --> 01:20:17,380
Don't insult the Republic!

848
01:20:19,088 --> 01:20:20,838
But I did, so what, are you going to hit me?

849
01:20:21,047 --> 01:20:22,172
It's alright, alright.

850
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:33,797
Let's be honest.

851
01:20:36,213 --> 01:20:40,172
But you told me you wanted to avenge your comrades

852
01:20:40,422 --> 01:20:43,005
How can you lie with something like that?

853
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:50,005
I believed your lies

854
01:20:50,297 --> 01:20:53,672
And I almost helped you carry it away, damn it.

855
01:20:54,463 --> 01:20:56,005
I have never lied.

856
01:20:57,422 --> 01:20:58,713
Forget it.

857
01:21:05,005 --> 01:21:07,838
- Please help. - How can I trust you?

858
01:21:08,005 --> 01:21:11,005
If you help me catch him, I'll give you the plates.

859
01:21:12,005 --> 01:21:13,588
I promise you.

860
01:21:17,713 --> 01:21:19,005
I know it's a lot

861
01:21:21,005 --> 01:21:23,005
please help.

862
01:21:24,838 --> 01:21:26,297
I beg you, comrade.

863
01:22:08,255 --> 01:22:10,005
We should wait, support is on the way.

864
01:22:16,838 --> 01:22:18,922
What are you looking for?

865
01:22:20,005 --> 01:22:22,588
The two of us can't take on an entire squad.

866
01:22:24,172 --> 01:22:25,172
That?

867
01:22:25,213 --> 01:22:27,922
They are ex-special forces who fought in wars.

868
01:22:29,005 --> 01:22:33,588
They are not like your untrained colleagues.

869
01:22:36,630 --> 01:22:39,463
If you want to live, stay here.

870
01:22:40,088 --> 01:22:41,213
It's not exactly 3100000.

871
01:22:42,172 --> 01:22:43,380
What is this?

872
01:22:47,005 --> 01:22:49,005
Yankee things are not good for boys,

873
01:22:49,713 --> 01:22:51,922
but at least they can live with some class.

874
01:22:52,297 --> 01:22:55,172
What do you mean by that?

875
01:22:56,630 --> 01:22:58,255
Thanks for everything.

876
01:23:12,005 --> 01:23:16,338
So the plates are verified, let's get to the deal. So the plates are authentic, let's talk about the deal.

877
01:23:16,797 --> 01:23:18,588
I was thinking

878
01:23:18,797 --> 01:23:22,838
the technology is mine, and so is the printing and distribution.

879
01:23:23,463 --> 01:23:27,297
For that reason, the plates are overpriced.

880
01:23:30,088 --> 01:23:32,713
Let's meet halfway, $5 million.

881
01:23:44,005 --> 01:23:47,213
Do you have coke? It could take a bit.

882
01:24:07,672 --> 01:24:10,297
Partners cannot be separated by more than 10 meters.

883
01:24:12,588 --> 01:24:14,630
The joint mission did not end.

884
01:24:18,005 --> 01:24:19,505
Down there?

885
01:24:22,588 --> 01:24:24,672
You have a plan?

886
01:24:26,505 --> 01:24:29,505
010-2335-6972, that's my number.

887
01:24:29,922 --> 01:24:30,922
Winett Will you do?

888
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:37,505
It took you quite a while.

889
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:40,005
Reply.

890
01:24:55,922 --> 01:24:57,630
It feels good.

891
01:24:58,005 --> 01:25:02,005
I missed this every time I came home from abroad.

892
01:25:03,297 --> 01:25:07,922
My people must taste the sweetness of capitalism.

893
01:25:12,005 --> 01:25:15,672
$10 million isn't even close.

894
01:25:18,838 --> 01:25:20,213
Let it be $20 million.

895
01:25:23,005 --> 01:25:24,005
That?

896
01:25:24,630 --> 01:25:27,838
No? So s30 million.

897
01:25:37,922 --> 01:25:40,422
Time runs while you hesitate.

898
01:25:44,297 --> 01:25:45,463
$40 million.

899
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:47,588
This is highway robbery!

900
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:58,880
I told you not to fuck with me.

901
01:26:08,005 --> 01:26:10,588
I didn't come here to make a deal.

902
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:13,463
I'll transfer the $10 million we originally agreed to.

903
01:26:13,713 --> 01:26:14,713
There's no need.

904
01:26:15,713 --> 01:26:17,422
I'm going to print my own money.

905
01:26:18,463 --> 01:26:19,463
Take the plates.

906
01:26:26,088 --> 01:26:27,297
What are you going to do? Hey! Hey!

907
01:26:58,672 --> 01:27:00,255
So you came.

908
01:27:02,005 --> 01:27:04,672
It's good to see you alive.

909
01:27:06,922 --> 01:27:11,005
Should we break things every time we meet?

910
01:27:27,797 --> 01:27:29,922
Time's up, come on

911
01:27:32,005 --> 01:27:33,005
Get covered!

912
01:27:43,047 --> 01:27:46,505
What the hell was that?

913
01:27:49,380 --> 01:27:50,672
Are you OK?

914
01:27:51,797 --> 01:27:54,297
So that's Cha's asshole?

915
01:27:55,172 --> 01:27:56,172
That is.

916
01:28:09,213 --> 01:28:10,505
See you at the pier.

917
01:28:42,838 --> 01:28:44,297
He missed the heart

918
01:28:48,672 --> 01:28:49,922
So=no!

919
01:28:50,172 --> 01:28:51,422
That. Kang.

920
01:28:51,838 --> 01:28:54,588
It's okay, you will live.

921
01:28:55,672 --> 01:28:57,297
Officer down, Sector C, parking lot!

922
01:28:57,797 --> 01:28:59,005
Send an ambulance!

923
01:29:00,463 --> 01:29:02,005
Part of being a cop.

924
01:29:02,588 --> 01:29:05,797
I won't die, please go after him

925
01:29:06,422 --> 01:29:08,588
Go and catch Cha.

926
01:29:10,005 --> 01:29:12,588
Apply pressure there.

927
01:29:17,005 --> 01:29:18,005
So=no!

928
01:29:24,088 --> 01:29:26,880
Route 2330, Songdo spur, runaway car found.

929
01:29:28,588 --> 01:29:30,630
This is D-1, we're on our way, out.

930
01:29:35,005 --> 01:29:36,005
You, bastard.

931
01:29:37,088 --> 01:29:38,422
Go back to the station at once.

932
01:29:44,463 --> 01:29:46,588
Why exactly?

933
01:29:46,713 --> 01:29:48,797
Why the joint mission can be exposed?

934
01:29:53,463 --> 01:29:55,588
The mission is over!

935
01:29:56,005 --> 01:29:58,422
You told me to do intelligence.

936
01:30:08,255 --> 01:30:10,005
I'm with the agents.

937
01:30:17,672 --> 01:30:19,463
Stop where you are and turn around.

938
01:30:19,672 --> 01:30:23,172
Because I should? You saw it too!

939
01:30:23,297 --> 01:30:27,922
He shot a cop in broad daylight!

940
01:30:28,005 --> 01:30:31,005
Who cares if it's south or north?

941
01:30:33,005 --> 01:30:34,297
Alright. Good.

942
01:30:36,047 --> 01:30:38,005
We are in a state of emergency.

943
01:30:38,297 --> 01:30:42,922
We have to arrest Cha and secure the plates at any cost.

944
01:30:43,047 --> 01:30:46,005
You must prevent Lim from killing him.

945
01:30:46,505 --> 01:30:49,630
If necessary, take out Lim.

946
01:30:53,172 --> 01:30:54,880
Curse!

947
01:31:06,213 --> 01:31:10,838
You promised, the plates are mine.

948
01:31:11,797 --> 01:31:13,297
I mean, from my country.

949
01:31:14,172 --> 01:31:18,797
Let me do my duty, become a respected policeman.

950
01:31:21,505 --> 01:31:23,005
Tomals.

951
01:31:23,838 --> 01:31:25,172
One more thing.

952
01:31:27,047 --> 01:31:29,380
When we get Cha, will you kill him?

953
01:31:31,630 --> 01:31:32,880
I understand your situation,

954
01:31:34,088 --> 01:31:38,172
but revenge is not part of our job.

955
01:31:39,005 --> 01:31:40,380
He must be arrested and punished.

956
01:31:41,088 --> 01:31:43,005
Nothing else, understand?

957
01:31:44,255 --> 01:31:46,047
Don't answer carelessly.

958
01:31:47,630 --> 01:31:49,255
I said I understand.

959
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:53,005
That's what being a policeman means.

960
01:32:02,255 --> 01:32:04,005
There, it's him!

961
01:32:15,838 --> 01:32:16,922
Slow down.

962
01:32:26,088 --> 01:32:27,380
Hold the wheel.

963
01:32:33,505 --> 01:32:34,505
Come closer.

964
01:34:19,588 --> 01:34:20,797
Hey Cheol-ryung!

965
01:34:22,255 --> 01:34:24,505
Stop Please.

966
01:34:31,005 --> 01:34:32,422
Because you did?

967
01:34:36,005 --> 01:34:37,005
Chem-only.

968
01:34:41,255 --> 01:34:44,422
I didn't want to be the lapdog

969
01:34:46,922 --> 01:34:51,297
of rotten heads of state in the name of our people.

970
01:34:53,005 --> 01:34:55,297
Do not tarnish the honor of our people.

971
01:34:57,380 --> 01:35:02,005
You betrayed his trust to be here for your revenge.

972
01:35:03,713 --> 01:35:07,422
Damn shit!

973
01:35:10,630 --> 01:35:11,630
Do it.

974
01:35:18,005 --> 01:35:19,172
Do not do it!

975
01:35:26,172 --> 01:35:28,005
What are you doing?!

976
01:35:29,005 --> 01:35:30,838
You can't, you will die!

977
01:35:31,297 --> 01:35:33,005
Let me go!

978
01:35:37,005 --> 01:35:39,005
Are you going to shoot me?

979
01:35:45,005 --> 01:35:47,005
You promised, asshole.

980
01:35:55,838 --> 01:35:58,005
He killed my wife.

981
01:36:37,588 --> 01:36:40,005
This was among his belongings.

982
01:36:41,713 --> 01:36:43,713
I thought you needed to know.

983
01:37:06,630 --> 01:37:08,588
Shit

984
01:37:27,005 --> 01:37:28,380
Before the cavalry arrives,

985
01:37:31,047 --> 01:37:32,588
Take this.

986
01:37:32,838 --> 01:37:36,880
He fell into the river along with Cha.

987
01:37:37,713 --> 01:37:39,713
It's the only way for you to live.

988
01:37:48,922 --> 01:37:52,588
Your wife in heaven will want that too.

989
01:37:57,922 --> 01:38:00,922
Cha jumped to his death.

990
01:38:12,380 --> 01:38:13,380
Go Go.

991
01:38:16,630 --> 01:38:19,005
Go right now!

992
01:38:54,005 --> 01:38:55,005
Good job.

993
01:38:55,088 --> 01:38:57,213
It is a pride for the Republic.

994
01:38:57,630 --> 01:39:00,922
We haven't recovered Cha's body.

995
01:39:01,213 --> 01:39:02,380
If you give me some time...

996
01:39:05,922 --> 01:39:08,838
That was the President's order.

997
01:39:09,005 --> 01:39:10,088
Forget Cha.

998
01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:12,880
This marks the end of the joint mission.

999
01:39:29,047 --> 01:39:31,005
Lend me your phone.

1000
01:39:42,838 --> 01:39:44,922
Daddy, answer the phone!

1001
01:39:45,088 --> 01:39:47,005
Don't pretend to be busy!

1002
01:39:47,797 --> 01:39:50,797
Daddy is on his way home.

1003
01:39:51,005 --> 01:39:52,922
- Whose girl are you? - Daddy...

1004
01:40:02,588 --> 01:40:04,005
Check it out.

1005
01:40:04,672 --> 01:40:07,005
there is something i lost

1006
01:40:07,880 --> 01:40:11,005
I don't have it, it's already with...

1007
01:40:15,088 --> 01:40:16,630
You have 2 hours.

1008
01:40:17,713 --> 01:40:21,297
Bring the plates to the power station on the pier.

1009
01:40:23,672 --> 01:40:27,422
Then I promise your family will live.

1010
01:40:28,922 --> 01:40:33,297
If you get police support, I'll break that promise.

1011
01:40:38,005 --> 01:40:42,630
I will tear your family to pieces.

1012
01:40:44,505 --> 01:40:48,005
Please let my daughter go

1013
01:41:02,047 --> 01:41:03,463
¡Cheol-ryungg

1014
01:41:04,422 --> 01:41:06,880
Cha gi sung...

1015
01:41:07,880 --> 01:41:10,005
He has my wife and Yeon-ah.

1016
01:41:11,005 --> 01:41:15,463
He wants the plates at 9 o'clock at the power station on the pier.

1017
01:41:16,005 --> 01:41:20,463
Or they will kill both.

1018
01:41:22,588 --> 01:41:24,880
CheoHyung, please help me.

1019
01:41:25,005 --> 01:41:27,505
Please don't let them kill Yeon-ah, please.

1020
01:41:39,047 --> 01:41:40,047
Dejennos.

1021
01:41:46,005 --> 01:41:47,005
Comrade

1022
01:41:47,297 --> 01:41:48,797
Cha is still alive.

1023
01:41:50,838 --> 01:41:52,088
Let me take care of that.

1024
01:41:53,630 --> 01:41:56,172
I told you the mission is over!

1025
01:41:56,380 --> 01:41:58,172
Are you still bent on your revenge?

1026
01:41:58,380 --> 01:42:00,505
Separate the order from your personal revenge!

1027
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:03,172
He took my South Korean partner's family hostage.

1028
01:42:16,047 --> 01:42:17,047
Leave them.

1029
01:42:18,713 --> 01:42:23,088
I don't want to lose anyone else.

1030
01:42:32,005 --> 01:42:36,588
I don't want to lose you either.

1031
01:42:39,005 --> 01:42:40,213
I'm sorry.

1032
01:42:42,380 --> 01:42:44,005
I'll be back later.

1033
01:43:02,838 --> 01:43:03,922
Mother"

1034
01:43:04,088 --> 01:43:05,005
Yes baby?

1035
01:43:08,005 --> 01:43:09,672
Yes, they are gone.

1036
01:43:10,005 --> 01:43:11,838
But keep your eyes closed.

1037
01:43:12,005 --> 01:43:14,505
Let's wait for daddy a little while longer.

1038
01:43:15,380 --> 01:43:16,630
It's good.

1039
01:43:25,213 --> 01:43:26,672
The goal is here.

1040
01:43:29,422 --> 01:43:30,630
¿Yeon-ah?

1041
01:43:31,713 --> 01:43:32,713
Yeon-ah!

1042
01:43:35,255 --> 01:43:36,380
Dear!

1043
01:43:37,922 --> 01:43:39,880
Honey, this way!

1044
01:43:40,088 --> 01:43:42,297
- Dad! - We are here!

1045
01:43:48,005 --> 01:43:51,588
- Dear! - Daddy!

1046
01:43:55,005 --> 01:43:57,005
- Dear! - Daddy!

1047
01:43:57,713 --> 01:43:59,005
Love...

1048
01:44:05,922 --> 01:44:07,422
Where are the plates?

1049
01:44:18,005 --> 01:44:19,838
Let the girls go first.

1050
01:44:20,172 --> 01:44:23,172
Then I'll give them to you.

1051
01:44:26,005 --> 01:44:28,088
Do you want to die together?

1052
01:44:29,005 --> 01:44:30,172
hand them over

1053
01:44:35,255 --> 01:44:36,380
You don't have them.

1054
01:44:36,588 --> 01:44:39,047
No! I don't have them, you bastard!

1055
01:44:40,005 --> 01:44:41,463
I do not have them!

1056
01:44:41,713 --> 01:44:43,880
Stop hiding and get out of there!

1057
01:44:53,922 --> 01:44:58,297
No, I am not sorry. Oh really.

1058
01:45:00,005 --> 01:45:01,005
Sorry comrade.

1059
01:45:02,588 --> 01:45:06,172
Captain Cha, it's all my fault.

1060
01:45:06,922 --> 01:45:10,005
My family doesn't deserve this.

1061
01:45:13,713 --> 01:45:17,880
I'm sorry, let them go. Kill me instead!

1062
01:45:20,255 --> 01:45:21,255
You are listening?

1063
01:45:31,005 --> 01:45:35,047
Yeon-ah, dad is here.

1064
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:38,380
We will go home soon.

1065
01:45:42,797 --> 01:45:43,838
Shoot.

1066
01:45:49,922 --> 01:45:52,005
Comrade, are you okay?

1067
01:45:56,922 --> 01:45:57,922
¿¿CneoHryung ?

1068
01:46:00,255 --> 01:46:01,588
I'm sorry, I was late.

1069
01:46:02,422 --> 01:46:03,463
Thank you.

1070
01:46:09,005 --> 01:46:10,088
Move and you're dead.

1071
01:46:11,422 --> 01:46:13,005
Motherfucker...

1072
01:46:13,463 --> 01:46:17,005
Let the southerners go, I'll give you the plates.

1073
01:46:18,588 --> 01:46:19,713
Cneohrung).

1074
01:46:20,213 --> 01:46:23,922
You betrayed your country to save those people?

1075
01:46:24,088 --> 01:46:25,713
But...

1076
01:46:27,588 --> 01:46:29,047
How can I trust you?

1077
01:46:30,005 --> 01:46:31,005
Crane, upper deck.

1078
01:46:47,588 --> 01:46:48,922
Captain.

1079
01:46:49,255 --> 01:46:51,005
Some pieces are missing.

1080
01:46:57,005 --> 01:46:58,422
Cneohrune)

1081
01:46:59,088 --> 01:47:01,088
There are only two small parts.

1082
01:47:01,380 --> 01:47:04,797
Like I said, let them go first.

1083
01:47:07,172 --> 01:47:09,172
Not bad for a lap dog.

1084
01:47:10,172 --> 01:47:12,588
Alright, alright.

1085
01:47:16,047 --> 01:47:17,255
Let them go.

1086
01:47:22,422 --> 01:47:24,380
Take your family and go home, comrade.

1087
01:47:26,005 --> 01:47:27,588
Yes, it's alright, Cheol-ryung.

1088
01:47:29,213 --> 01:47:31,588
and what happens...

1089
01:47:34,630 --> 01:47:35,922
with...

1090
01:47:37,088 --> 01:47:38,255
configo?

1091
01:47:44,005 --> 01:47:45,213
Brother.

1092
01:47:48,005 --> 01:47:49,297
I'm sorry.

1093
01:47:51,297 --> 01:47:53,255
I got you into this mess.

1094
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:02,005
I need you to move.

1095
01:48:04,797 --> 01:48:07,797
Okay, thank you, thank you very much.

1096
01:48:20,255 --> 01:48:21,255
Go for him!

1097
01:48:35,005 --> 01:48:38,297
Cheol-ryung, there's no need to shed blood

1098
01:48:40,005 --> 01:48:44,005
If you go back to the North, you will have a firing squad.

1099
01:48:44,088 --> 01:48:45,505
Join us.

1100
01:48:46,047 --> 01:48:48,172
There is a ship waiting for us.

1101
01:48:51,713 --> 01:48:53,005
Captain!

1102
01:49:02,005 --> 01:49:05,797
Alright, I'm going.

1103
01:49:29,588 --> 01:49:31,005
Why aren't we moving?

1104
01:49:31,088 --> 01:49:32,172
Dear.

1105
01:49:34,922 --> 01:49:38,880
You know I love them more than anything, right?

1106
01:49:41,005 --> 01:49:42,005
But...

1107
01:49:44,838 --> 01:49:47,422
I am a detective. A South Korean policeman.

1108
01:49:49,005 --> 01:49:50,005
AND?

1109
01:49:54,005 --> 01:49:55,005
Cheol-ryung is alone...

1110
01:49:57,713 --> 01:49:59,422
the mMueve mor vl

1111
01:49:59,588 --> 01:50:01,422
Kill them all and bring Cheol-ryung back.

1112
01:50:02,463 --> 01:50:03,672
Do you really want that?

1113
01:50:03,797 --> 01:50:06,880
You won't go alone, right? Will you contact the boss?

1114
01:50:07,047 --> 01:50:08,713
Yes of course.

1115
01:51:22,213 --> 01:51:24,380
Look over there.

1116
01:53:11,047 --> 01:53:12,255
¡Cheol-ryungg

1117
01:53:13,588 --> 01:53:14,588
Take this.

1118
01:53:24,005 --> 01:53:25,380
Are you OK?

1119
01:53:26,088 --> 01:53:27,088
Great.

1120
01:53:27,797 --> 01:53:29,005
I'm sorry, I was late.

1121
01:53:30,505 --> 01:53:32,422
Cause you're not at home?

1122
01:53:33,005 --> 01:53:35,797
And why are you here? It's the same deal.

1123
01:53:37,922 --> 01:53:40,005
You cried and begged for help.

1124
01:53:40,672 --> 01:53:43,088
Yeah, I cried like a bitch, didn't I?

1125
01:53:44,047 --> 01:53:47,088
There is no one like me, anyway.

1126
01:53:49,005 --> 01:53:50,005
Just be thankful.

1127
01:53:53,005 --> 01:53:54,505
char. she's running away out there!

1128
01:53:56,713 --> 01:53:59,005
I'm actually a good shot.

1129
01:53:59,588 --> 01:54:02,172
Where was he? It's very fast.

1130
01:55:20,463 --> 01:55:23,880
I should have killed you first!

1131
01:55:28,005 --> 01:55:29,005
Hey, jerk!

1132
01:55:29,797 --> 01:55:33,630
Do you know what those plaques are?

1133
01:55:36,255 --> 01:55:40,880
They are revenge against the Republic for abandoning its people,

1134
01:55:41,255 --> 01:55:43,672
and it's a reward

1135
01:55:44,588 --> 01:55:45,922
by my blood and sweat!

1136
01:55:46,088 --> 01:55:50,713
Can't you ruin such a noble plan?

1137
01:56:06,047 --> 01:56:07,047
Cneohrung).

1138
01:56:09,588 --> 01:56:11,005
Come on...

1139
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:15,880
For!

1140
01:56:18,297 --> 01:56:20,047
CheoHrnunc), mirame.

1141
01:56:21,630 --> 01:56:22,422
Let me see

1142
01:56:24,005 --> 01:56:25,797
Curse!

1143
01:57:16,797 --> 01:57:18,797
Sons of bitches.

1144
01:58:26,047 --> 01:58:27,588
take it with you

1145
01:58:31,380 --> 01:58:35,005
Are you that desperate to go to prison?

1146
01:58:36,005 --> 01:58:38,713
My country should be ashamed of this.

1147
01:58:42,713 --> 01:58:44,630
Be a respected cop for yours.

1148
01:58:50,672 --> 01:58:55,047
It's not like we get paid that well for our services.

1149
01:59:00,088 --> 01:59:04,505
And it's not like they're going to reward us.

1150
01:59:06,005 --> 01:59:10,005
Why did you become a policeman?

1151
01:59:10,172 --> 01:59:12,005
I didn't know it would be like this.

1152
01:59:12,713 --> 01:59:16,672
I thought I would look good while shooting guns,

1153
01:59:26,047 --> 01:59:28,213
How about you?

1154
01:59:28,838 --> 01:59:31,880
They're all starving so no criminals I guess.

1155
01:59:34,588 --> 01:59:39,005
Wait, it's a detective's paradise.

1156
01:59:40,838 --> 01:59:44,005
Take me with you, I want to defect to the north.

1157
01:59:46,047 --> 01:59:48,172
Better beware.

1158
01:59:48,713 --> 01:59:51,005
That mouth could put you in prison.

1159
01:59:54,255 --> 01:59:57,630
Anyway, that's how I started.

1160
01:59:57,922 --> 02:00:02,005
Catch the bad guys, save the good guys. You?

1161
02:00:04,797 --> 02:00:07,880
Me too, at first.

1162
02:00:10,005 --> 02:00:12,297
Man Man. Everything hurts.

1163
02:00:17,088 --> 02:00:18,630
It took their time.

1164
02:00:19,422 --> 02:00:21,505
That boss bastard.

1165
02:00:47,005 --> 02:00:49,005
"1 Year Later, Pyongyang".

1166
02:01:25,213 --> 02:01:26,213
¿Pyongyang?

1167
02:01:26,380 --> 02:01:27,880
Yeah.

1168
02:01:29,713 --> 02:01:32,422
Pyongyang's first serial killer.

1169
02:01:33,005 --> 02:01:35,672
The suspect is a South Korean, who defected to the North.

1170
02:01:36,213 --> 02:01:38,922
Anyway, it's a covert operation.

1171
02:01:39,630 --> 02:01:41,172
They already chose your counterpart.

1172
02:01:42,047 --> 02:01:43,672
Oh yeah?

1173
02:01:47,630 --> 02:01:49,005
You're still as ugly as ever.

1174
02:01:51,297 --> 02:01:53,505
- Good to see you. - I am glad too.

1175
02:01:57,297 --> 02:01:59,005
Rule #1 of our joint mission,

1176
02:02:00,005 --> 02:02:04,005
the southern weapon is confiscated until the case is resolved.

1177
02:02:04,380 --> 02:02:06,005
OK, it's OK.

1178
02:02:06,463 --> 02:02:08,588
