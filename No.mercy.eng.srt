1
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,730
Who is Chang Seok?

2
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:28,860
Who?

3
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,810
O-Chang-Seok

4
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:36,010
Yes, it's me.

5
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:49,150
MERCILESSLY

6
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,000
Sister.

7
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,780
Were you waiting for me here?

8
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,760
How have you been?

9
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,830
Good and you?

10
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,900
Time passes quickly right.

11
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,780
Don't just eat the noodles, eat the meat too.

12
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,790
I just like jajjangmieon.

13
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:09,790
It's been so long since we ate jajjangmieon together.

14
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,930
Here's a gift.

15
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,660
How beautiful!

16
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,040
Let me help you.

17
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,750
- Looks Good. - I want to see.

18
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:42,660
- It's very beautiful, very beautiful! - Thank you sister.

19
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,800
En-hui, you have sauce in your mouth.

20
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:54,740
Next time I'll buy you a better one.

21
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:00,820
The truth is that...

22
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,870
How about we visit mom and dad this weekend?

23
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,780
Because? Do not you want to go?

24
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:29,480
- Better tomorrow. - And the school?

25
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:35,750
Unnie, I really hate going to school.

26
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:45,930
It's normal for all kids to hate her but still, school is important and you'll graduate fast.

27
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,860
Can I never go to school?

28
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:56,840
I want to work like you.

29
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,540
Again?

30
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,750
Do you still remember what dad said before he died?

31
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,950
The most important thing in this world is promises, what did you promise him that time?

32
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,900
that you would obey me in everything

33
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:25,770
and that I would protect you.

34
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,770
Can I skip school tomorrow?

35
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,070
I want to be with you.

36
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,870
There you go again...

37
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:44,820
I want you to be happy

38
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:52,830
as everyone.

39
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:27,000
To my dear sister:

40
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,870
You've finally come home.

41
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,810
I don't remember how long I've waited to meet again.

42
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:38,810
I cried a lot when I thought of you.

43
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:45,710
In the future, let's not part and live together forever.

44
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:55,480
For the most beautiful sister, I also bought you a gift. I bought it with the money you sent me every month.

45
00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:00,790
From En-Hui, your dear little sister.

46
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,030
Listen...

47
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,980
Exams will start next week.

48
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:22,850
After eating, don't forget to study hard. Understood?

49
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,660
Come with us.

50
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,870
- Because? - Stop acting stupid and just follow us.

51
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:46,040
Can't you just let me go home free today?

52
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,040
What did you say?

53
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,120
Because?

54
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:56,850
My sister just got home.

55
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,920
Oh really? He has nothing to do with me.

56
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,930
That? What are you looking at?

57
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,830
Come with us now.

58
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,840
This is a load.

59
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:23,740
Your skill is excellent, you can incapacitate men with just your bare hands.

60
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:28,840
There is no denying that you are a good bodyguard.

61
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:32,020
But you also know that in this job

62
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,830
I can't do anything right now.

63
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:40,760
It's not because of you, but because of the team's decisions.

64
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:43,770
You say you've worked according to the rules.

65
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,800
But since you've already hurt someone.

66
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,000
There are too many gossips nowadays.

67
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:51,840
They sentenced you to 6 months in jail, right?

68
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,770
- 1 year and a half. - It's true

69
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:05,750
That offender was only given 6 months but the person who defended himself was given 1 and a half years. The world is not fair.

70
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,940
Hey, where's the food?

71
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,040
Sorry, I'll go buy it now.

72
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:33,040
Next time listen carefully!

73
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:39,020
If you want to come here again, please be smart.

74
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,760
Or do you want to be an idiot like her?

75
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:48,030
Hey. Can I go now?

76
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,690
Let's play at your house.

77
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:58,800
Hey retard, if I let you go already then there would be no reason to bring you.

78
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,880
Just humor us, and we can all be happy.

79
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,180
Why don't you sing?

80
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:14,020
- It's from En-Hui's house. - This stupid girl.

81
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,990
Give it to me. Now take it off.

82
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,800
He told you to take it off.

83
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:36,610
How are you? Alright?

84
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,750
Not really, but he's better than you.

85
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,980
We are not bad people. we are here to play

86
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:47,820
Alright. TRUE?

87
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,050
someone is calling.

88
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,030
His opponent.

89
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,860
Listen, ask him where he is.

90
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,000
Tell him you're close, okay?

91
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,940
Don't get list.

92
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,870
Let me go to the bathroom, sir.

93
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:38,900
I have a message.

94
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:40,900
Room 502.

95
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,010
Hey!

96
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:53,790
Get out of here, motherfucker.

97
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,990
You pervert.

98
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,880
Get out right now!

99
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:57,950
Do not worry honey. Are you afraid?

100
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,760
What are you doing in there?

101
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,980
This crazy girl.

102
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,440
The number you have dialed cannot be reached.

103
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:25,830
Do not worry too much. Teenagers run away from home.

104
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,930
Will return eventually.

105
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,800
So don't worry too much.

106
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,410
Do you know his condition?

107
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,910
Then why did you put her in a public school?

108
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:46,850
And if you're so worried, you should send her and pick her up from school yourself.

109
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:59,840
Sorry. I need to show you something.

110
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:10,760
I will start recording. Don't move, bitch!

111
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:17,820
Stop moving too much.

112
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,950
Let me go.

113
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:27,930
I will record it. Smile...I said smile.

114
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,800
Smile bitch.

115
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:00,760
Seon, where will you go? Do you want to go back to karaoke?

116
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:03,990
Are you kidding? Unnie will take you have fun.

117
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:10,740
There are many handsome boys in the Hong University area. It is not a joke.

118
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,940
Will something bad happen to En-Hui?

119
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,810
Stop talking about it, it's not important.

120
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,880
If you do it again, I'll cut your mouth off.

121
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:23,880
- You scared me. - Where is En Hui?

122
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:26,820
Ah En-Hui's sister from prison.

123
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,020
We don't know anything, so just go.

124
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,690
Bitch.

125
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,390
Hey damn.

126
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:41,770
You know En-Hui, right?

127
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,810
Curse.

128
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,680
Oh my back.

129
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,820
Where is my sister?

130
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,900
It's alright, it's alright.

131
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:16,880
Take it.

132
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:18,840
Fast.

133
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:25,010
We didn't do it on purpose.

134
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,620
I have messages.

135
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,850
Room 403.

136
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:33,820
Let's make money.

137
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:38,850
Old pervert, do you want to die?

138
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:45,770
Seok-young, what are you doing here? Go away quick.

139
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,000
What are they doing?

140
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:51,370
Do you want to get caught abusing a minor, you idiot?

141
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,950
So this is why you went to the bathroom.

142
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:03,820
That is why it is important to teach children lessons.

143
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:08,750
So do you want me to cut off your head?

144
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:12,760
- Do you think we are afraid? He-Call the police now.

145
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,870
Police? Police?

146
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,830
Come here. Come here.

147
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,850
Take it bastard.

148
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:44,990
Do I report it or just let it go? Damn!

149
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,800
We are innocent! That damn gangster!

150
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:54,030
He gave us 10 million for it and forced us to sign. What could we do?

151
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:59,900
He hit us and took her with him, just look at this.

152
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,760
Hello you call Happy Cash, we are always here for you.

153
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:26,800
Business hours have not started, please leave us your phone number after the tone.

154
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:34,040
Hello you call Happy Cash, we are always here for you.

155
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,950
Business hours have not started...

156
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,330
Police, is there anything I can help you with?

157
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,820
My sister is missing.

158
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,830
Someone took her after school.

159
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,890
I know that person's phone number, but he can't be reached.

160
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,740
The number is 0102...

161
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,870
Did you confirm that she's missing and not because she ran away?

162
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,180
Bad people took her.

163
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:19,680
I understand, but I have to make sure there are no problems before the investigation starts...

164
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,950
That's why I want to give you the suspect's phone number.

165
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,990
Please help me find out who he is and what kind of person he is.

166
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,890
It is not so simple, we must follow the procedure.

167
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:33,960
You must first come to the nearest station, and tell us exactly what's going on.

168
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:37,940
Write that in the report, only then can we move the investigation, got it?

169
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,740
Just so?

170
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,910
As?

171
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,280
Hello? Hello?

172
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,010
But what really happened yesterday?

173
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:16,900
- Suddenly you called and bring women here. - Are there clients for her?

174
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,950
Sure, that's why he keeps crying and asks to go home.

175
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:23,960
I just gave him sleeping pills.

176
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,930
Mr Jung, you are very clever.

177
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:30,930
But that girl looks very young.

178
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,830
You're not a minor, are you?

179
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,800
Don't worry. It is not.

180
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:39,840
And this business is absolutely illegal.

181
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:44,880
Does even if it is make any difference?

182
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,770
Idiot, always causing trouble here.

183
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,810
What are you doing? Put it back in, tuck it in.

184
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,950
This looks very old, is it still working?

185
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,980
Where did you get this from? It seems fake.

186
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:06,920
I don't know...it was a gift from someone and I don't know the purpose it gave it either.

187
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,030
A lady.

188
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:12,940
Give you what? If you want it...you have to pay a price.

189
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,740
There are only 15.

190
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:20,810
Better than nothing.

191
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:24,880
Since she seems retarded.

192
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,590
Have you eaten?

193
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:08,280
I want to go home.

194
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:16,870
I have to go home, my sister...

195
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,870
Shut up, don't start crying.

196
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,830
- What the hell? - Are you Ho Sueng?

197
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,770
The boss is not here.

198
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:01,850
I do not know anything. I'm just an employee.

199
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:08,910
I only drive for him sometimes.

200
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,750
So I don't really know his exact address.

201
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:15,680
- I already gave you the number of his car. - Then why can't I contact him?

202
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:22,560
- Just look in the office, this is an illegal business. - Then give me his personal number.

203
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:28,800
If you knew and it was me, would you remain silent? She didn't give me her number.

204
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:34,910
But I don't know either, I swear on my mother's grave I don't know her number.

205
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:12,760
What's happening? I'm just teaching this girl a lesson.

206
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,820
Teaching is my specialty.

207
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:21,950
Open your legs. Don't worry.

208
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,020
- Okay, just open them. - Just obey.

209
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:32,430
There is nothing to worry about.

210
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:46,750
This retarded idiot...damn.

211
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:03,940
She's too crazy.

212
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:05,870
Give me back my money.

213
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,880
Why are you complaining to me?

214
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:12,900
I just don't want it. He just pays back the money and take her back.

215
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:15,410
Are you playing me, idiot? Shit.

216
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:17,840
Hello? hello?

217
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:23,810
I'm on my way to the bank, I just came to take the money.

218
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:25,970
So when will I get my money back?

219
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:29,810
I go to the bank and take the money, simple as that.

220
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:31,660
10 million won.

221
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,860
Yeah! 10 million bastard.

222
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:37,890
Why is it so hard to understand? You stress me out in the morning, bastard.

223
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,850
It's not because of that.

224
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,760
That? Do you still have something to say?

225
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:45,020
There's something I have to tell you.

226
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,830
I won't hear anything right now.

227
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,030
Just wait for me there.

228
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,800
- I have a call. - Hello?

229
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,760
Does Seung speak?

230
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:56,970
What's happening?

231
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:01,210
The day before yesterday you kidnapped a girl named Park En-Hui, where is she now?

232
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:04,920
Did you prepare the money?

233
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:05,780
What money?

234
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:09,750
Wait. Who are you? Where did you get my number?

235
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:14,860
You don't need to know. I'll ask you again. Where is my sister?

236
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,730
So you're that retarded girl's sister, huh?

237
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,830
This crazy dares to hang up on me.

238
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,810
What the hell is this shit?

239
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:59,000
What the hell...?

240
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:06,970
Take me to my sister.

241
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:10,470
Ah, you're that bitch.

242
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,920
Wait.

243
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:18,290
Hit the gas.

244
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:22,860
What do you want exactly?

245
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:23,930
Just shut your mouth.

246
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,160
Curse.

247
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:52,680
I think there is a misunderstanding. Your sister and I parted pleasantly that day.

248
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:57,050
If I keep driving like this, I'll pass out.

249
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:01,220
Don't strangle me too much. I will behave well.

250
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,900
Loose.

251
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:30,520
It's cursed.

252
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:20,430
You're late. Do not come. I have already solved it.

253
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,870
Hello?

254
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:25,870
He asked me to call you.

255
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:28,840
That? Who are you?

256
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:32,840
I'm an employee, I'm calling about cash issues.

257
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,820
I see, but now everything is fixed.

258
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:38,130
- Is the boss busy? - Yes, but...

259
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,790
what did you mean before...

260
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:49,760
I have already solved the money problems. So don't worry about that girl anymore. I also sent it elsewhere.

261
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,000
Where to?

262
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,000
Why do you need to know so much?

263
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:00,800
Only come here if you're curious.

264
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:38,380
- What is on offer? - Where is your boss?

265
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:48,880
Why are you so aggressive?

266
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:49,960
Who is this woman?

267
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:07,340
Why do you look so scared?

268
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,210
That's your sister.

269
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:12,850
Where did you take my sister?

270
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:19,390
Heavens. You would have come earlier. You're late.

271
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:23,860
Just speak nicely.

272
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,360
I'm asking you again.

273
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:30,770
Miss, in business there is something we call business ethics.

274
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,840
My business is based on trust...How can I betray...?

275
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,910
Stop saying stupid things and talk.

276
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:54,960
Why didn't you take good care of your sister and pay the debt?

277
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:59,020
If you had paid me, it wouldn't have happened.

278
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,760
You kidnapped her and sold her! This is not a question of money!

279
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:08,830
That is your problem. I only sold it to get my money back. Damn bastard.

280
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,850
Die bitch, die bitch.

281
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,910
My head, my head.

282
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,830
Wait wait wait.

283
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,000
Quick, tell him...

284
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:26,780
- I told him that if he had someone to call to do it. - To my sister.

285
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,910
Like no one answered the phone. She called somewhere else.

286
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:55,880
She called the Mini super place.

287
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:00,880
That's all we know.

288
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:10,680
An old man answered the call. But the person who picked it up was a young man in a suit.

289
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,830
What time?

290
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:18,770
An hour or 2 ago.

291
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:23,770
let me go... let me go

292
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:42,970
Give me the number.

293
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:47,020
do you know me

294
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,830
I did not call you.

295
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:59,840
We're not going to my house, are we?

296
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:03,810
You will know later.

297
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:08,880
Still a long way to go. Just get some rest.

298
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:35,900
Someone took En Hui away.

299
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,020
Hello?

300
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:32,790
Sir, please go away. Fast

301
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,870
Sir, please, I beg you. Let's just go.

302
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:42,900
I'm sorry.

303
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:55,820
Its charm.

304
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:07,950
Help me please....

305
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:10,960
I'm his brother. She's sick.

306
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,380
Help me out. Help.

307
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:20,380
No! No!

308
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:32,050
Please return me to my sister.

309
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:35,790
I know you take me with those bad men.

310
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,870
I promise I'll behave. But please take me to my sister.

311
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:54,910
Please. I miss my sister

312
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:04,580
- Where are you? - On the way.

313
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:06,790
Why is there so much noise?

314
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:08,880
It's no big deal.

315
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:12,260
I'll be there in about 1 hour. Where should I take her?

316
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,640
Take her to the usual place.

317
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,480
Also, don't do anything stupid.

318
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:20,860
I don't want problems.

319
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,800
- Call me when it's done. - OK.

320
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:29,040
Please give us a few words.

321
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:41,780
Greetings ladies and gentlemen, I am one of the new members...

322
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:11,890
You brought me this way, damn it.

323
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:17,020
Hey, I'm not doing anything wrong.

324
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,770
We need to talk.

325
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:34,970
It's okay, I was wrong.

326
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:39,000
I said that I am guilty. Open the trunk fast.

327
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,820
Wait. let me go now Yeah?

328
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:47,890
I swear I won't tell anyone.

329
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:54,890
You're right about your sister, you have to find her, so let me go now.

330
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,930
Wait...shit...please.

331
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,910
Your sister ripped me off first.

332
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:08,880
I wasn't the first to look for her, you know?

333
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:25,900
I'll kill you. Bitch!

334
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:29,930
I am going to kill you!

335
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:23,010
When you make a call, make it right.

336
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:26,780
I don't know other numbers.

337
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:28,900
Where is your sister?

338
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:36,900
She didn't answer the phone.

339
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:46,780
If I ask you to come here it is to drink together.

340
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:51,850
I have great news to share with you. You must drink with me.

341
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:07,990
You know how I got to this position right?

342
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:17,770
Thanks to you, I became an expert at doing that.

343
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:22,940
But if you did it right, you wouldn't be this pathetic.

344
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:31,010
You said it was impossible to find the girl

345
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:36,830
but suddenly, it just appeared. Just like that, huh?

346
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,020
Find it.

347
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:51,810
But he finds his little sister first.

348
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:56,900
Do everything right. Without errors.

349
00:50:57,850 --> 00:50:59,750
I want her dead.

350
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:13,020
Can you let me go please?

351
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,930
This is the number of this store, right?

352
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:56,310
Yeah...

353
00:51:56,610 --> 00:51:58,970
Last night my sister called here. Then someone took her.

354
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:01,040
Did you answer?

355
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:05,000
What do you mean?

356
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,910
Do you know En Hui? She lives around here.

357
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:18,860
Honey...did you get any calls yesterday..?

358
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,830
Do you remember that sweet girl that once came here?

359
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:30,960
It has disappeared. And last night she called here.

360
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:34,840
Well... yes, I remember.

361
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:37,970
Her sister is looking for her.

362
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:41,840
So it's you who called.

363
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:45,980
You don't really take good care of her.

364
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:51,850
So you want to accuse us to get a little money?

365
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:56,830
I won't be fooled by your tricks, I don't know anything and I don't have any money either.

366
00:52:58,030 --> 00:52:59,060
What are you talking about?

367
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:15,920
Alright. Take what you want.

368
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:22,020
Heavens, how beautiful.

369
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:26,760
Don't worry...

370
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:50,750
How could you?!

371
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:56,760
You better kill me. What kind of human are you?

372
00:53:56,830 --> 00:54:00,920
How could you...?

373
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,030
Where is En Hui?

374
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:10,770
I don't know...

375
00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:25,920
Who took my sister?

376
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:30,850
Please let me go first.

377
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:39,990
I only followed instructions on the phone. That's all.

378
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:48,980
A woman spoke to me about money.

379
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:53,040
I thought they wanted to give me some.

380
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:55,010
So...

381
00:54:55,850 --> 00:55:00,850
So no one called me anymore.

382
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:03,920
Wait! I apologize for my actions.

383
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:08,020
But it's over.

384
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:14,930
So I'm sorry too.

385
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:44,890
I don't want to die before tasting that fresh meat.

386
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:49,870
Hey, you remember that stupid girl, right?

387
00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:54,800
- Yes. - I already fucked her.

388
00:55:57,810 --> 00:55:58,780
No kidding.

389
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,010
It's true, the best feeling...

390
00:56:01,050 --> 00:56:03,820
You just need to touch her a little, and you can have sex with her.

391
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:09,980
Great.

392
00:56:10,790 --> 00:56:13,960
Jump in 1..2..3

393
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:20,030
OK well. Okay, look here.

394
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,840
Next time we go back...

395
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:32,840
Welcome...Heavens!

396
00:56:38,850 --> 00:56:40,850
How can you take a picture with that face?

397
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:44,920
You should go to the hospital. Why did you come here?

398
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:50,990
I can take a memorable photo of you too.

399
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:03,040
This student? Do you remember her?

400
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:06,910
How can I remember all the customers.

401
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:23,830
Don't be so harsh. just calm down

402
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,870
Calm. Look here

403
00:57:28,970 --> 00:57:34,770
Ok, let me...

404
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:38,880
This way you look more beautiful

405
00:57:38,910 --> 00:57:41,010
Stop moving damn it!

406
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:44,780
Do you remember her now?!

407
00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:46,980
I swear I don't know anything.

408
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:55,800
Try the shop owner.

409
00:57:56,900 --> 00:58:00,800
- Sit down. - They look very entertaining.

410
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:08,900
- Our area now has a stupid girl. -Ah, yes I know which one, what does she have?

411
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:11,780
This guy fucked her.

412
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:18,850
Just passed, best feeling.

413
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:21,980
Share it with me.

414
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:29,790
Do not move. Take this money.

415
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,770
Who is Chang Seok?

416
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,070
Who?

417
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:46,740
O-Chang-Seok.

418
00:59:47,010 --> 00:59:54,010
A beautiful lady searches for Chang-Seok. It must be my lucky day.

419
00:59:54,850 --> 00:59:57,010
Yes, I am Chang-seok. you who...?

420
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:25,000
You were involved in the call last night, right?

421
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,680
Where is my sister?

422
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:29,910
How can I know that?

423
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:34,860
I have the number. I'll give it to you to call him. Hurt hurts!

424
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:38,860
Call who?

425
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:43,920
It's the one you're voting for now.

426
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:49,840
That guy sent by the politician.

427
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:29,840
I want to ask you something.

428
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:35,010
Don't you have daughters? How could you?

429
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,850
I only have two children.

430
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:35,940
It's me, En-Hui.

431
01:02:36,010 --> 01:02:38,000
Who?

432
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:42,910
Sir, I...

433
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:45,990
Are you the guardian of En-Hui?

434
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:52,790
I want the money before dawn. And you can take it.

435
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:06,810
A stranger called me and wants me to pay the debt.

436
01:03:07,810 --> 01:03:09,970
Because? Did they tell you where?

437
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:14,780
OK. I'll be waiting.

438
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:38,560
3 YEARS BEFORE

439
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:37,920
Where you come from?

440
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,930
Tell me. Where from?

441
01:04:42,970 --> 01:04:45,840
In Hui, what's up?

442
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:49,770
Where have you been? Answer if I ask!

443
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:53,980
Tell me. Where?

444
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:14,910
- Yeah? - You took my sister.

445
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:22,020
Where are you now?

446
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:23,900
What are you going to do?

447
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:27,860
What do you really want from that girl?

448
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:31,030
Yes, you're just an assistant.

449
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:34,970
Would you know where Park Ting Chuen is?

450
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:38,910
- Because? -I'll kill that jerk if he hurt my sister.

451
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:45,010
Have you really been looking for her all this time?

452
01:07:47,990 --> 01:07:51,890
You must bring it to me.

453
01:07:52,030 --> 01:07:55,960
Alive or dead. I want you to bring it to me.

454
01:08:03,070 --> 01:08:05,040
Better get ready...

455
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:08,680
I will be waiting for you here.

456
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:11,880
And what will you do?

457
01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:15,780
Wait till I find you and my sister and you'll know.

458
01:08:58,860 --> 01:09:04,930
Making the world a better place so everyone can achieve their dreams.

459
01:10:07,930 --> 01:10:10,830
I want to rest. You watch out.

460
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:17,930
Rest well.

461
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:28,040
What are you doing lady?

462
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:30,870
What the hell?

463
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:35,910
Crazy woman!

464
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:04,750
Where is my sister?

465
01:11:11,790 --> 01:11:12,890
Who are you?

466
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:20,770
Oh that's right, you're the bitch that always causes trouble.

467
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:25,800
If you shoot me in the head. How can you find it?

468
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:30,900
Suddenly I wanted to see her.

469
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:36,950
Where?

470
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,010
You are crazy.

471
01:11:39,850 --> 01:11:40,950
Where is?

472
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:46,990
Get in right now!

473
01:11:52,830 --> 01:11:55,800
Confused!

474
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:16,890
Kill her now!

475
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:29,890
Damn woman!

476
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:37,380
It's cursed!

477
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:06,440
Shit!

478
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,560
Where are you now?

479
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:08,920
- You have the drug, right? Just do it now. - That?

480
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:12,990
Put the dope in that bitch, idiot!

481
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:16,760
Then it will die.

482
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:19,030
Just do what I tell you!

483
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:23,990
And it also brings together all our people.

484
01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:25,980
I'll kill them at 2.

485
01:15:26,850 --> 01:15:27,820
Where are you now?

486
01:15:29,020 --> 01:15:32,780
If you're near Central Park, we'll meet you there.

487
01:15:32,950 --> 01:15:34,920
I'll send the men to pick you up.

488
01:15:34,950 --> 01:15:37,980
Alright. You'd better hurry up.

489
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:01,910
I made a decision.

490
01:16:03,790 --> 01:16:04,780
What do you mean?

491
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:23,830
It's me. I need your help.

492
01:16:56,770 --> 01:16:57,740
Come on.

493
01:17:01,810 --> 01:17:02,900
Where to?

494
01:17:05,780 --> 01:17:06,940
To home.

495
01:18:28,860 --> 01:18:30,860
You have betrayed me?

496
01:18:32,070 --> 01:18:33,760
Motherfucker!

497
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,860
I can't be nice to you anymore.

498
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:12,580
Hurry up and bring it.

499
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:28,640
Is it fixed?

500
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:29,840
Yes Boss.

501
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:31,810
It still has not arrived?

502
01:21:32,180 --> 01:21:35,010
It seems that here it comes.

503
01:21:37,790 --> 01:21:38,950
She must be crazy.

504
01:21:41,860 --> 01:21:43,830
Careful! Aside!

505
01:22:07,050 --> 01:22:08,980
What do they do? Catch her!

506
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:12,790
Look at it!

507
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:34,540
Damn.

508
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:47,900
¡Rodeenla!

509
01:23:54,860 --> 01:23:56,760
Look over here.

510
01:23:57,020 --> 01:23:59,790
Here is your sister!

511
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:25,910
lift her up

512
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:40,890
Now you are dead.

513
01:24:54,980 --> 01:24:56,010
Look outside.

514
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:03,780
Go dead.

515
01:27:42,850 --> 01:27:45,790
Unnie. Let's get out of here.

516
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:49,790
We'll move away and find a better place.

517
01:27:49,990 --> 01:27:51,860
Where is that?

518
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:57,590
Not here, but in another place far away.

519
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:03,390
Where there are no bad people.

520
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:12,940
En Hui did nothing wrong.

521
01:28:16,950 --> 01:28:20,820
What are you talking about, of course you did nothing wrong, En Hui.

522
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:27,780
Is...

523
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,760
only...

524
01:28:36,870 --> 01:28:38,030
But because you cry?

525
01:28:43,910 --> 01:28:46,940
No...I'm not crying

526
01:28:48,070 --> 01:28:51,970
I will not make mistakes.

527
01:28:54,020 --> 01:28:56,790
In Hui...trust me, okay?

528
01:29:15,010 --> 01:29:21,780
Henceforth. I will never let anyone hurt you.

529
01:29:25,020 --> 01:29:25,950
did you understand?
