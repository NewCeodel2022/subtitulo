00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,580
Do you see the criminal
coming out behind me?

5
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,186
After about a year since
the beginning of 2016

6
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:55,130
The first extradition between the Philippines
and South Korea took place at 4 p.m. today.

7
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,486
For the first time, 47 Korean criminals
who absconded to the philippines

8
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:06,510
after committing crimes in Korea were
repatriated en masse by chartered flights.

9
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:12,440
This is police using citizens special
forces and local motorcade personnel...

10
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,700
Jong Dongbi, you bastard!!

11
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,266
What... Stop him! Stop!

12
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:27,897
Quick!

13
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,080
You son of bitch!!

14
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,076
Die with me!!

15
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:44,100
.

16
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:05,750
2022

17
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,106
September 12th, now.

18
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,790
Burbad, Manila, Philippines.

19
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,236
Korean criminals arrested in the philippines
will be transported to Busan port

20
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,656
in 2 days at 7 p.m. on 14th.

21
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,180
By an international cargo ship departing
Manila Container Terminal at 5 p.m. today.

22
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:28,310
Considering that a suicide bombing at
the airport during the first repatriation

23
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,126
in 2017 killed seven police officers and
injured more than 30 airport passengers.

24
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:38,846
The convoy decided to use cargo ship
terminals inaccessible to private citizens.

25
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,346
Therefore, the National Police Agency, in
cooperation with the Busan Port Authority,

26
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:48,016
Designated the 58,000-ton bulk carrier
"Frontier Titan" as the escort vessel.

27
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,276
About 20 criminal police officers
with more than 10 years of experience

28
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,696
in violent cases were
assigned to escort the ship.

29
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,076
The wanted criminals were
repatriated as Red Notice criminals,

30
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:02,616
the highest ranking criminals by Interpol.

31
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,520
Hey, isn't our operation secret?

32
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,900
It was reported in the news.

33
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,410
Good job.

34
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,010
Stay close.

35
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,090
Get off quickly.

36
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,560
Quick, quick.

37
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,270
Get out of the bus quickly.

38
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,350
Get up.

39
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,496
I'm just telling you to
spread your legs a bit.

40
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,377
Get up quicky.

41
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:46,560
OK OK.

42
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,190
Where?

43
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,530
Let's go, let's go.

44
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,040
Don't touch me, shit.

45
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,750
Hey this way.

46
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:10,880
Ah the smell of shit, f♪♪k.

47
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:20,890
Lee Dong II, Red Scar,
Lee Sang-moo, get on board!

48
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,980
I thought you retired long ago.

49
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,900
Your daughter has become a woman.

50
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,040
Jungu.

51
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,000
You stupid bastard.

52
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,670
Since you're in school you
should listen to your teachers.

53
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,170
What kind of attitude is that?

54
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,140
I saw the photos and was very impressed.

55
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,576
How the f♪♪k can the
interpol beat a person up.

56
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,980
This is not right.

57
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,830
How come the wind is so strong?

58
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,976
Let go, let go.

59
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,330
Let me go, f♪♪k.

60
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,420
Sorry.

61
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:32,380
It's already a mess and
I want to go on a trip.

62
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,260
Senior, What are those people for?

63
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,350
It's a doctor and a nurse.

64
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,650
It seems that all the Korean
criminals are in the Philippines.

65
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:48,626
It said the police hospital staff
couldn't get out, so yesterday I was...

66
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,530
I'm already tired of it.

67
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,450
Shouldn't I come?

68
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:58,516
Let go of me, let go of me, you bastard.

69
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,580
Tear him apart, the stupid bastard.

70
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,380
- OK OK.
- What the fuck are you guys looking at?

71
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:07,710
Get on board.

72
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,880
Yes.

73
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,890
Hey you punk.

74
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,270
Nice to meet you, let's go.

75
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:35,610
.

76
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,910
Quick.

77
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,546
What are you doing?

78
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:46,570
What?

79
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,280
What the hell are you doing?

80
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,330
Attention.

81
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,830
Attention!

82
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,120
I'll keep it short.

83
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,350
I am the leader of the Central Commando.

84
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,856
Our team will be responsible for all
security control tasks in the border area.

85
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,550
It is a prisoner escort
team from the Philippines.

86
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,366
So you can go out the same door you
came to work through in the morning.

87
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,100
No, Hey.

88
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,680
What are you barging in to say?

89
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,270
I didn't get orders like that.

90
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,110
I'm giving you the order now.

91
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,490
I'll give you ten minutes.

92
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:32,080
Project the vtos on the front
screen and prepare the setup.

93
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,027
Project Wolf Hunting.

94
00:08:49,051 --> 00:08:51,430
Why can't we fly in a plane?

95
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,076
Let go of me.

96
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,966
What's all this bullshit
about getting on a plane.

97
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:07,030
Dumb shit.

98
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,926
Just let us go like this.

99
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,280
Shut up, dumbass.

100
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,420
Get in.

101
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,290
Be gentle, be gentle.

102
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:26,630
Murder under Article 250 of the
Penal Code, on or about April 23, 2013.

103
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:30,786
According to the principle of secularism,
from now on, this ship is Korean territory

104
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,810
and does not belong to
the Philippines anymore.

105
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,020
Park Jung-Do.

106
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:44,350
September 12, 16:20, according to
Article 250 of the Criminal Code, 12, 1,

107
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:51,330
you are a teacher who raped and
killed 13 people, 300 weeks escape time.

108
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:57,830
Sorry officer, I've been
having trouble with my ankle.

109
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,000
Can you help me unshackle my feet?

110
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,510
Do Soo-hwa, 261 incidents
of special atrocities.

111
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,770
Interpol Red List.

112
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:21,100
In short, you can get a lawyer to represent
you, appeal, and apply for a denial of arrest.

113
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:23,650
OK?

114
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,040
Oh F♪♪k

115
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,170
It's going to be like
that all the way to Korea.

116
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,420
Hey, be gentle, you bitch.

117
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,840
Who do you think I am?

118
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,220
Hey, don't touch me.

119
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,230
Hey, be gentle. My skin is very delicate.

120
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,047
Choi Myong-joo.

121
00:10:58,071 --> 00:11:03,530
You are accused of killing your spouse and
in-laws under Article 250 of the Penal Code.

122
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,370
Attention!!

123
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:22,316
Meals twice a day, bathroom once a day,
and no toothbrush for the safety of all.

124
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:26,260
Ah... What the F♪♪k.

125
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,956
I don't understand what human rights
are because I'm with such dumbasses.

126
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,310
There is no CCTV here either.

127
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:38,126
So, if you want to eat well before
returning to your long-lost homeland.

128
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:41,690
Just please, don't toss and
turn, and behave yourselves.

129
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,820
If they roll up and leave,
you won't just be hungry.

130
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,830
Thanks for your hard
work, this side is ready.

131
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:54,170
Okay, we will leave the port as soon as
we get permission from the control center.

132
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,760
All sections, stand by.

133
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,890
Everyone has done their homework, right?

134
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:11,060
Don't forget the emergency rule that you
can't take your eyes off all these people

135
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,866
even one second before you arrive.

136
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:15,246
What happened last time, even
if you don't say it, we all know.

137
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:18,360
Do not let your guard down, got it?

138
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,530
Yes, sir.

139
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,040
Greetings, Captain. This is the
busan Port Special Control Office.

140
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,266
Please always make sure the
VFC remains on channel 16.

141
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,016
MBDP transmission and
reception are confirmed.

142
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,880
I have also contacted the local
MICCs in the Philippines and Taiwan.

143
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,090
The ship's security alarm
system is operating normally.

144
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:43,550
"Frontier Titan" departed
promptly at 17:00 Philippine time.

145
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,180
The tugboat is below.

146
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,820
I saw it.

147
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,700
Did you bring a lot of money?

148
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,250
I don't think so.

149
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:21,510
Ah yes.

150
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,640
Doctor, maybe you brought
something like alcohol?

151
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,576
No, I can't drink.

152
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,480
What a shame, I would have
loved to have a refreshing beer.

153
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:37,610
What to do?

154
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,910
There are only 5 weeks
left until I go home.

155
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:50,580
Our youngest must have
forgotten all about his father's face.

156
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,210
Why are we doing this?

157
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,500
Ah, shit.

158
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,750
Don't get annoyed.

159
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,050
It's like ordering
Seolleon in the West Sea.

160
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:03,100
These criminals have a good life.

161
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,746
Feed them, put them to
sleep, and get them for free.

162
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:07,850
These pussies.

163
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,270
I know you are annoyed
and sensitive, but bear with it.

164
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,690
Just three days, just three days.

165
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,747
Good.

166
00:14:13,771 --> 00:14:15,320
You go inside and take a break.

167
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,110
We'll get the meal done.

168
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,490
OK.

169
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,250
Hello.

170
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,500
Are you the doctor?

171
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:30,830
Yeah, Yeah.

172
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,766
We're cooking right now.

173
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,340
No.

174
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,840
I'll will take it away.

175
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,356
I'm off.

176
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,317
Okay.

177
00:14:39,341 --> 00:14:41,066
Take care of Da-yeon and
Seo-joon, they take care of your meals

178
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:43,447
because there are no
shifts for them to do it.

179
00:14:43,471 --> 00:14:48,060
Ah, thank you both for your help.

180
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:51,900
Good bye brother.

181
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,350
Okay, got it.

182
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,520
Red slow.

183
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,520
Yes, we are now heading out for departure.

184
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,296
Well, let's eat first.

185
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,047
Thanks.

186
00:16:17,071 --> 00:16:18,351
There's something for us, right?

187
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,580
Hey man, it's delcious.

188
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:24,830
That's how you do it.

189
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,250
Hey, don't fart, eat well.

190
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,420
Ok.

191
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,140
It's too noisy.

192
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,200
Eat.

193
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:03,410
Move your legs away.

194
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,750
Move your legs you stupid cunt.

195
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,170
You're still laughing?

196
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,210
Isn't that crazy, stupid.

197
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,100
You eat.

198
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,980
Here you go.

199
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,280
Cross-legged.

200
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,620
Cross-legged.

201
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,660
Are you the only one to drink?

202
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,090
Got it.

203
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,666
Ah, let's go.

204
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,297
- Is that okay?
- Excuse me.

205
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:06,710
Hello.

206
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:13,130
I ate and brought you something.

207
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:49,100
.

208
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:34,680
Oh...

209
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,530
Do i just... need to put sleeping pills in?

210
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,716
Can I touch it directly with my hand?

211
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,250
Don't think too much.

212
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,750
Just finish what you have to do and leave.

213
00:21:55,020 --> 00:22:02,270
Currently, latitude 18.6, longitude
189.38, cruising speed 12 knots.

214
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,900
It has passed through the high seas.

215
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,860
Current weather conditions?

216
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:12,580
A rainstorm warning has been issued
from Philipine waters until the buoy.

217
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:19,186
It is expected to advance 30 per hour with a
wind speed of 13.5m, equivalent to 4th level.

218
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,880
That's enough.

219
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,016
Just pay attention to safety,
there are no flammable

220
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,686
and explosive materials
in the cargo hold, right?

221
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:28,220
None. Only cement and iron ore.

222
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,710
In seven minutes, we will enter the
international waters of Titano, border Titano.

223
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,796
Twelve years have passed.

224
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,416
The child was born.

225
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,166
I carried him around.

226
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:48,740
Patrolling around, lurking around.

227
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:53,636
It's really crazy that it took
about 2 weeks to catch.

228
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:56,460
Brother, do you know
where you caught him from?

229
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,330
You know busking, right?

230
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:07,566
Lately the kids have been singing
and dancing and playing instruments.

231
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,527
Busking?

232
00:23:08,551 --> 00:23:10,140
Yeah, busking.

233
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,156
That's where he was caught.

234
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:15,640
Hey, these people have
no reason but have sense.

235
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:17,270
Don't mention it.

236
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,320
But it's not like this guy
has a cell phone or anything.

237
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,876
So I asked, "Where's your cell phone?"

238
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,876
Turns out he said he left
it in the bathroom at home.

239
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,506
The Bathroom?

240
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:28,087
Yeah.

241
00:23:28,111 --> 00:23:35,476
I went to look for it, and it
was behind the bathroom door.

242
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,580
There were three of us.

243
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,090
Gotcha! Number 3!

244
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,640
Panicked and surprised again, right?

245
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:55,850
Scared?

246
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:17,200
Just grab him at once, shake shake.

247
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:00,170
Did I make a mistake? That
was already three years ago.

248
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:02,500
Until now

249
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,356
Look at this

250
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,380
How is this

251
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:13,850
Look at this.

252
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:34,836
What a life this is. I'm going to bed.

253
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,066
But it's almost time
for my shift. I'm so tired.

254
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:39,710
So why start playing cards.

255
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,920
Shit.

256
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,180
What's that?

257
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:55,150
Ah you stupid bastard.

258
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,940
I told you to put the gun
in, what are you looking at.

259
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:04,030
Good evening.

260
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,450
Shit.

261
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:09,660
You can't watch movies
in foreign countries.

262
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,080
Am I the only one?

263
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,840
F♪♪k.

264
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:21,380
What the hell.

265
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:49,100
.

266
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:42,890
He took out all the
boxes for the prisoners.

267
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,720
I would really be crazy if
it wasn't for President Jo.

268
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,456
They are the police,
they should get this right.

269
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,230
That's right.

270
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,520
It's a police matter.

271
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:54,020
Okay.

272
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,836
So when is it going to rain?

273
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,386
Then the song will be interrupted again.

274
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:06,040
It says it's going to rain at
09:00. It's to going to come.

275
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,620
What's the matter?

276
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,020
It takes you guys to drive the ship, right?

277
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,640
Yes, Yes.

278
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,990
Turn on the roof light.

279
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,520
Where's the contact signal
coming from on the Korean side?

280
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,120
There.

281
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,470
What?

282
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,720
How did this happen?

283
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,180
Team Leader.

284
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,810
The signal was cut off.

285
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,640
What does that mean?

286
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,626
It looks like it disappeared.

287
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,756
What are you talking about?

288
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,070
Is it an AIS malfunction?

289
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,400
Hurry up and connect to the VHF.

290
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,910
Yes, got it.

291
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:11,710
What about the security alert system?

292
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,586
There was little response.

293
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:16,650
I think it was cut off
without an emergency signal.

294
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,226
I can't connect to VHF.

295
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,340
Since Both are disconnected from the AIS,

296
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,620
I don't think it's a mere fault problem.

297
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,196
Dumbass, did I ask what you think?

298
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,216
Did I, punk?

299
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,026
Don't think you're so good that you
have to teach me how to do things.

300
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:34,370
Don't just bring up problems, bring up
countermeasures. What about countermeasures?

301
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,980
Call IMA to reset the satellite signal.

302
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:38,836
Got it?

303
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,090
Roger that.

304
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:17,160
A1, A1, F, are you there?

305
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:21,006
What's wrong? Is something suddenly wrong?

306
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,710
The signal seems to be bad. Wait a minute.

307
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,410
This is A1 Lee Dayeon.

308
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,080
Is F there?

309
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,670
Team leader Lee Seong-ho?

310
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:31,840
Anyone who can hear me, please reply.

311
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,630
A1, A1.

312
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:40,970
Please reply. What to
reply you bunch of idiots.

313
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,996
I'll go find the team leader
first, I-'ll be back in a minute.

314
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:51,916
It's not like it's been a malfunction
twice, so don't run around.

315
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,570
Don't get into trouble.

316
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,070
Senior.

317
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:00,030
Suit yourself.

318
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:06,920
Hey, is there a young
male detective? Please.

319
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,960
F♪♪king bitch.

320
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,340
What the heck.

321
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,456
A1, A1.

322
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,440
Will you shut up?

323
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:35,740
But sister, my stomach hurts a little.

324
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:40,370
Can I go to the bathroom?

325
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,000
Hey.

326
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,420
Yes we are sitting down.

327
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,170
Don't sleep.

328
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:13,150
Hey, what's up?

329
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,160
I asked you what you're doing?

330
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,910
Shit, hey.

331
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,130
Sorry Sorry Sorry.

332
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,800
What the hell? Are you crazy?

333
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,010
Who are you?

334
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,310
Douchebags.

335
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:30,900
Ah f♪♪k, what a pain in the ass.

336
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:42,896
I already checked the
location you mentioned,

337
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,880
there's no problems
with the site right now.

338
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,670
None of the other ships
around made a claim.

339
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:50,276
Did you check the problem inside the ship?

340
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,366
I'm not sure but... we're checking
everything might happened.

341
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:55,406
I don't think there's
problem inside the ship.

342
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:56,446
Emergency situation occurred!

343
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:57,810
Emergency situation occurred!

344
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:15,580
Help.

345
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:21,830
Brother.

346
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:32,430
Let them go first, I
guess they are all waiting.

347
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:33,930
Okay.

348
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,350
Wait.

349
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,440
Give me the knife.

350
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:03,040
Except for the guys on the phone right now.

351
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:08,510
The others find the satellite image
of the ship from the last position.

352
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:11,390
Look for the Chinese or
Japanese Meteorological Agency,

353
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,100
or anything that can find them.

354
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,520
Make sure you catch them.

355
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,840
How nice.

356
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,890
1, 2, 3.1, 2, 3.

357
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:41,900
Can anyone hear me? Please reply.

358
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,900
A1, A1, seniors.

359
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,540
Oh.

360
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,630
Don't move.

361
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,300
I'm a doctor, doctor.

362
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:07,197
- I know, but why did you come out of there?
- Ah.

363
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:14,980
Lee Dayeon, What are you doing in
there? Why did you take the gun out?

364
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,690
Okay, I'm sorry.

365
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,060
I'm sorry, doctor.

366
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:20,470
She was trying to do her duty.

367
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:26,176
I've been looking for leader. Is everyone's
internet and walkie-talkies down?

368
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,910
Yes, none of ours are working,
so we're going to make sure.

369
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,080
There's someone over there.

370
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:35,370
Brother, over there.

371
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:36,870
What's he doing.

372
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,146
Isn't that an axe he's holding?

373
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:41,590
These fools really, over there.

374
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:53,560
What am i going to do?

375
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:01,610
Let's go.

376
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:12,620
Thank you, thank you.

377
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:18,790
Only now it feels alive.

378
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:24,300
Thank you.

379
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,390
Who gave you this special f♪♪king pardon?

380
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,690
Hey, where are the pussies?

381
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:42,240
One of them is cute.

382
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,200
Hey, wanna come along?

383
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:46,426
F♪♪k off.

384
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:49,160
Hey, you want to go too?

385
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:06,680
That bitch is mine.

386
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:08,430
Jung Do.

387
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,730
What are these idiots doing.

388
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,440
It's been a long time
since I've used it. It's nice.

389
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,360
Who's this?

390
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,620
You know that artist too, right?

391
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:30,700
He doesn't need a knife either.
He's a gentlemen, Lee Dong-il.

392
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,710
It's really alarming to
see you look so pathetic.

393
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:38,000
I haven't seen it in about 10 years.

394
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,920
How come you haven't seen it once?

395
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,010
What are you doing now?

396
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:45,890
Can't you see it?

397
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:48,930
I'm running away in
order to live like a human.

398
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:57,166
But you stinking idiot, I saved
you, you should say thank you.

399
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,666
You ungrateful douche bag.

400
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,290
Just be a good boy and go back to Korea.

401
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:04,780
Don't do something you regret.

402
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,410
What kind of pussy talk is that?

403
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,080
Are there any dumbasses
here who want to go to Korea?

404
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,340
Raise you hand.

405
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:19,840
It's gonna be so easy.

406
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:57,750
What are you doing?

407
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:05,550
You son of a bitch.

408
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,060
Shit

409
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:14,860
Don't move.

410
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:18,860
Senior.

411
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:54,940
I told you to be gentle.

412
00:42:57,230 --> 00:43:01,740
Anyway, I can't listen to
anything when I'm excited.

413
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:07,096
Brother, just help us wash the dishes.

414
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,710
Why do i have to do the dishes every day?

415
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,710
I'll take care of Myong-joo
when I'm doing it.

416
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,090
If that's the case, it's already messed up.

417
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,920
You know how to go back, right.

418
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,980
Those who want to follow will
come, those who don't want to follow,

419
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,020
watch out for themselves, damn it.

420
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,460
See you soon.

421
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:55,380
Shit, I was going to kill him.

422
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:07,140
But it's still going to Korea.

423
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:12,230
It's going crazy how things
have turned out this way.

424
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:06,370
Ah shit, these idiots
are really getting to me.

425
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:10,920
Your people are dead, what are
you going to do, you stupid cunt.

426
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:16,470
What are you talking about? Your
people are dead you stupid cunt.

427
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:20,100
By now Jung-do should have
finished the job beautifully.

428
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:24,020
Park Jung-do... Crazy bastard.

429
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:38,780
Drop the gun.

430
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:44,960
Put the gun down!!

431
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:57,550
Stand up.

432
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:20,120
Lee Dayeon take cover.

433
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:36,630
Is everything okay?

434
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:01,700
Are you okay?

435
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:07,460
I know you're tired, is there
any way to reach Korea?

436
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:11,460
Engine room, Satellite phone.

437
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:12,920
Hmm?

438
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:31,900
That was gunfire, wasn't it?

439
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:34,700
How did you hear the sound of gunfire?

440
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,780
Must have been fixing something.

441
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:38,330
But where did you get the beer?

442
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,136
When I went to the
restaurant, there was beer there.

443
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,476
Would you like to join me for a drink?

444
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,040
No, I can't drink.

445
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:47,226
But where have you been?

446
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:49,670
Oh, down there. That's not important.

447
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:51,146
That's the sound of gunfire.

448
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:53,840
On my way here, I met the
interrogators with their guns.

449
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:59,196
If you're so worried, I'll go
out and see what's going on.

450
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:00,470
Don't go out there.

451
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:02,826
There are a lot of criminals out there.

452
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:04,480
How can a doctor be so timid.

453
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:06,980
You're not very attractive
to women, are you, doctor?

454
00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:14,160
What a lack of charm.

455
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:16,450
You have so little guts.

456
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:18,540
It's okay, it's okay.

457
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,580
The fortune teller said this
year that I have bad fortune.

458
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:26,670
You really do everything.

459
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:35,850
If it's so good, why don't you drink it.

460
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,570
You have worked hard.

461
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:55,830
It's all moved over.

462
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,080
Good.

463
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:10,970
No soju now.

464
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:17,260
You smoke a cigarette
and go somewhere nice.

465
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:33,680
Now this is not a problem, right?

466
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:39,940
You guys can't come down
here for that. Please go up.

467
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:01,960
It's okay, don't be afraid.

468
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,130
Where's the satellite phone?

469
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:06,710
EC.

470
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:09,356
Say something understandable, dammit.

471
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:12,640
Engine control room over there.

472
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:19,850
Those two guys, you go
over there and smash it.

473
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,440
You go along too.

474
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:20,460
Seniors.

475
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:23,300
What?

476
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:25,526
F♪♪k.

477
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:26,550
Where did they all go?

478
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:37,520
Where are the others?

479
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,650
I don't know.

480
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:43,450
We acted immediately
after we heard the shots.

481
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:46,320
The bastards ended up in trouble.

482
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:49,120
Communications were all cut off too.

483
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:55,160
They were prepared
before they got on the ship.

484
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,120
We need to tell the Korean
side of the situation first.

485
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:03,170
It says that the engine
room can contact with Korea.

486
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:30,870
Why did you bring this uncle?

487
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,210
Without me, the boat would have stopped.

488
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:42,026
That's what they said.

489
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:44,260
I'm the chief engineer.

490
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:50,220
Forget it, get him done, let's go.

491
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:51,510
Good.

492
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:53,020
Let's go.

493
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:55,310
Uncle you get off work.

494
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:09,830
What are you doing?

495
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:11,620
Don't go too far.

496
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,290
Park Jung-do, you jerk.

497
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:24,930
This dumbass.

498
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:27,010
You can't shoot here.

499
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:28,220
The boat will stop.

500
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:29,736
There's an engine here.

501
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,470
It's noisy, you stupid bastard.

502
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:36,860
F♪♪k, can the police
shoot at people like that?

503
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:40,690
It's self-defense from
now on, you assholes.

504
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:44,530
I'm not from this side! Please help me.

505
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:59,550
Kids, take care of them.

506
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:21,900
What is it? Still alive?

507
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:24,200
Nobody move!

508
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:31,726
I'm sure it's this style,
how can you not die.

509
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:34,120
Don't look, don't look.

510
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:41,316
I said don't move, dumbass.

511
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:45,300
Jung-do, I told you, this is
not a boat you can escape from.

512
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:49,850
I'm so mad, Who's the one
who should escape now?

513
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:53,400
Stick a knife in your
mouth, for f♪♪k's sake.

514
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:57,610
F♪♪k!

515
00:55:58,610 --> 00:55:59,690
Stupid motherf♪♪ker!

516
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:22,760
Hide, hide!

517
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:30,250
Shit!

518
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:32,060
Brother, brother, quick.

519
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:33,820
Shit.

520
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:38,280
Out of the way, damn it.

521
00:59:10,610 --> 00:59:11,980
Stinky bitch, shit.

522
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:21,330
F♪♪k all of you, you stupid bastards.

523
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,200
F♪♪k you.

524
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:54,840
Nothing is different.

525
01:01:56,190 --> 01:01:57,490
This is hell.

526
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:38,690
Hurry up.

527
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:40,720
There is a exit.

528
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Just shoot.

529
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:19,670
Come on.

530
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,820
Hurry up.

531
01:04:03,970 --> 01:04:08,720
His prison clothes are very old.

532
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:13,170
I have been in prison for 30 years.

533
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:15,580
We should get treatment.

534
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:18,820
Let's go.

535
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:26,440
Officer.

536
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:29,200
A photo is sent to us by MRCC
from the sea area near Taiwan.

537
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:31,500
The location is finally
captured very near from us.

538
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:33,400
Enlarge the photo.

539
01:04:37,190 --> 01:04:37,730
When is it sent?

540
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:39,160
About 30 minutes ago.

541
01:04:39,990 --> 01:04:41,630
It doesn't look like the ship is sinking.

542
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:43,480
Enlarge more.

543
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:48,680
The stern looks fine.

544
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:51,550
What is that?

545
01:04:51,710 --> 01:04:52,780
Why is it red over there?

546
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:55,270
Enlarge that area.

547
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:03,340
F♪♪k.

548
01:05:04,210 --> 01:05:07,630
I knew. The criminals are going to do evil.

549
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:14,906
What is the police doing on the ship?

550
01:05:14,930 --> 01:05:16,400
Son of a bitch.

551
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:33,300
Director Pyo

552
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:40,250
Report?

553
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,040
You are joking.

554
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:43,830
You are too arrogant.

555
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:48,050
I am doing my job as you have asked.

556
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:49,347
I already knew about the situation.

557
01:05:49,371 --> 01:05:50,510
The situation?

558
01:05:51,470 --> 01:05:52,560
Don't talk too much.

559
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,060
Just make it simple.

560
01:05:55,070 --> 01:05:56,920
Officer Oh, you should
go there by yourself.

561
01:05:57,190 --> 01:05:58,860
Go there by myself? Me?

562
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:01,490
The ship is coming now.

563
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:05,520
Oh my, you are really out of you mind.

564
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:08,640
Do you think coastguards and
Ministry of Defense will support us?

565
01:06:09,470 --> 01:06:13,280
There are dozens of people on
that ship. How can I catch that guy?

566
01:06:14,350 --> 01:06:15,696
You should say something realistic.

567
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:22,190
It was you who said it's fine to let
him get on the ship and lose all faculties.

568
01:06:23,530 --> 01:06:24,866
It was you who said...

569
01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:26,890
F♪♪k. Then what do you want me to do?

570
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:29,700
I only said alpha should get on the ship.

571
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,526
I didn't say the criminals
should be there too.

572
01:06:31,550 --> 01:06:34,100
Now things have gone really bad.

573
01:06:35,830 --> 01:06:37,110
But why should that blame on me?

574
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:39,680
It's you that pretend to know nothing.

575
01:06:40,350 --> 01:06:41,486
What do you want me to do?

576
01:06:41,510 --> 01:06:43,000
Son of a bitch.

577
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:00,840
Listen.

578
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:05,200
The naval base you will see in
front of it belongs to The U.S. Army.

579
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:08,900
Just shut up.

580
01:07:10,310 --> 01:07:11,840
And bring alpha to me.

581
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:14,750
Hey, you son of a bitch.

582
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:17,540
Hey.

583
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:22,980
F♪♪k.

584
01:07:50,270 --> 01:07:51,270
Son of a bitch.

585
01:07:52,010 --> 01:07:53,810
Shut up.

586
01:08:07,570 --> 01:08:08,217
You have no manners.

587
01:08:08,241 --> 01:08:09,641
You should knock on the door first.

588
01:08:10,570 --> 01:08:12,610
Is it your first time seeing
someone in the toilet?

589
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:14,160
Why are you so late?

590
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:17,610
Tell me the truth.

591
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:18,940
Did you forget me?

592
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:20,360
What are you talking about?

593
01:08:21,550 --> 01:08:22,910
All in all, I came.

594
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:24,760
Nonsense.

595
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:27,240
Hello.

596
01:08:27,330 --> 01:08:28,680
Hi.

597
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:31,510
What's that all over your body.

598
01:08:31,630 --> 01:08:34,976
F♪♪k, you're driving
me crazy. Just Stop it.

599
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,320
Hey.

600
01:08:36,430 --> 01:08:38,470
I gave you money, right?

601
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:40,510
Shit. Can you see this?

602
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:42,220
Can you?

603
01:08:42,350 --> 01:08:43,350
Can you?

604
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:45,090
You should have done it well.

605
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:49,400
Turn around.

606
01:08:51,370 --> 01:08:53,630
Why are you always sitting at here?

607
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:55,850
I need to change my clothes.

608
01:08:56,350 --> 01:08:57,410
But I don't have any.

609
01:08:58,200 --> 01:08:59,740
You crazy bitch.

610
01:09:00,090 --> 01:09:01,100
Help me with this.

611
01:09:09,490 --> 01:09:10,756
What a psycho.

612
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:11,876
Don't follow me.

613
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:13,656
You said you would help me.

614
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:14,700
When?

615
01:09:24,810 --> 01:09:25,810
Hurry up.

616
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:49,990
What's going on?

617
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:53,760
You were nervous too much.

618
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:01,580
Why do you sleep in my room?

619
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:10,066
Sir, wake up.

620
01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:12,000
I heard something weird.

621
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:13,870
Is it the sound of shooting?

622
01:10:15,150 --> 01:10:16,430
You always say it's shooting.

623
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,280
No, it's not.

624
01:10:22,050 --> 01:10:23,930
It sounds like wailing.

625
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:27,870
Or maybe it's something fell down.

626
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:43,880
It's lifeboat.

627
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:48,640
But why is it loosened?

628
01:11:24,050 --> 01:11:25,256
Help! Help!

629
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,040
Sir, WHat's going on?

630
01:11:27,230 --> 01:11:28,560
There's no time.

631
01:11:28,830 --> 01:11:29,830
He's chasing after me.

632
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:31,176
Just let me go.

633
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,060
He did that in front of me.

634
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:36,590
Why are you always treating me like this?

635
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:37,940
Calm down.

636
01:11:39,810 --> 01:11:41,140
What did you just say?

637
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:42,780
She's dead.

638
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:46,970
He's in the medical room now.

639
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:49,370
It's there undoubtedly.

640
01:11:49,550 --> 01:11:50,790
I gave hypnotic...

641
01:11:52,890 --> 01:11:53,890
Say it clear.

642
01:11:54,790 --> 01:12:02,210
The monster's eyes are sewed up just like a
dead body and he wears the clothes like that.

643
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:06,270
What's that?

644
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:07,560
Tell us everything.

645
01:12:08,130 --> 01:12:09,130
I have no idea.

646
01:12:09,670 --> 01:12:10,810
I just follow the orders.

647
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,020
What are you asked to do, bastard?

648
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:22,400
I took annual leave.

649
01:12:23,550 --> 01:12:27,836
He asked me to give hypnotic every
six hours and offered me a lot of money.

650
01:12:27,860 --> 01:12:30,490
I only followed the order.

651
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:34,780
Is it the association?

652
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:36,100
Yes.

653
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:41,700
Is it the place that sells you vitamins
that makes you ten years younger?

654
01:12:42,140 --> 01:12:43,140
Yes.

655
01:12:45,950 --> 01:12:47,870
There are faculties from
the company in my room.

656
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:49,580
They probably know about this.

657
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:52,690
Whatever.

658
01:12:54,510 --> 01:12:57,970
There's medicine on the lifeboat, right?

659
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:01,940
Yes, but it is destroyed.

660
01:13:02,860 --> 01:13:04,060
Oh no.

661
01:13:09,030 --> 01:13:13,030
I have put some in the basement.

662
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:17,100
Go check it.

663
01:13:17,510 --> 01:13:19,200
I will find others.

664
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:20,840
Alone?

665
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:23,720
No, It's too dangerous.

666
01:13:24,410 --> 01:13:25,097
I will go with you.

667
01:13:25,121 --> 01:13:26,290
It's all right.

668
01:13:28,110 --> 01:13:31,090
There should be at least
one police to go and search.

669
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:35,360
However...

670
01:13:38,470 --> 01:13:39,470
Let's go.

671
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:42,920
Let's Hurry up.

672
01:14:04,730 --> 01:14:06,810
Jung Du is in the engine room.

673
01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:08,320
My Jung Du.

674
01:14:09,050 --> 01:14:11,310
He finally can get out of the jail.

675
01:14:11,790 --> 01:14:15,510
Although he is rude,
he is quite clever, right?

676
01:14:57,870 --> 01:14:59,820
What the hell, you son of a bitch.

677
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:29,630
Who are you?

678
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:32,600
Let's leave.

679
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:34,980
Sir.

680
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:36,620
I say, just go.

681
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:01,900
Hurry up, bitch.

682
01:16:05,170 --> 01:16:06,510
Help, Help.

683
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:21,400
Hurry up.

684
01:16:38,990 --> 01:16:41,020
Where is the destination?

685
01:16:43,870 --> 01:16:44,350
Hey.

686
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:45,850
Quiet.

687
01:16:59,580 --> 01:17:01,590
The door shouldn't be opened.

688
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:02,910
What are these?

689
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:13,080
Oh my god.

690
01:18:30,130 --> 01:18:31,130
Sir.

691
01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:33,820
Let's go.

692
01:19:33,630 --> 01:19:35,310
What's this?

693
01:19:43,420 --> 01:19:43,760
Come here.

694
01:19:44,190 --> 01:19:45,530
My legs.

695
01:19:49,070 --> 01:19:50,820
It's a slight scratch.

696
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:53,260
The wound seems not so deep.

697
01:19:53,710 --> 01:19:55,190
This is gonna hurt.

698
01:19:55,910 --> 01:19:57,650
Easy. Easy.

699
01:19:59,170 --> 01:20:00,400
Do you need treatment?

700
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:04,400
Didn't you get hurt?

701
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:05,760
I see you bleeding.

702
01:20:09,020 --> 01:20:10,080
It's kind of painful.

703
01:20:10,210 --> 01:20:11,940
We don't have anesthetic.

704
01:20:13,170 --> 01:20:16,880
Please do it gently.

705
01:20:17,870 --> 01:20:18,870
Ok, I will.

706
01:20:36,170 --> 01:20:37,230
This is Japanese.

707
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:48,860
This is the criminal we just met.

708
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:55,570
His name is Kim Wan Gyu.

709
01:20:55,990 --> 01:20:57,310
He was born in 1911.

710
01:20:58,310 --> 01:20:59,310
1911?

711
01:21:00,950 --> 01:21:02,230
He's about my grandfather's age.

712
01:21:03,550 --> 01:21:05,950
This doesn't make sense.

713
01:21:07,110 --> 01:21:10,360
He was imprisoned in
Korea, Ceong Do Bu in 1943.

714
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:13,141
He joined Japan's aggressive
war against the Philippines.

715
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:20,100
He was put inside of a Japanese POW
camp on the west side of Mindanao Island.

716
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:23,710
He received an AA level diagnosis which is

717
01:21:24,110 --> 01:21:30,240
the most idealistic result in the Japanese
experiment of inventing human weapons.

718
01:21:30,980 --> 01:21:31,980
A human weapon?

719
01:21:33,190 --> 01:21:34,190
Experiment?

720
01:21:34,940 --> 01:21:35,806
What on earth...

721
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:36,830
Let me help you.

722
01:21:37,820 --> 01:21:42,320
That is, he has been alive from then on.

723
01:21:44,110 --> 01:21:45,760
But why is it a secret?

724
01:21:54,260 --> 01:21:55,260
Follow me.

725
01:22:07,570 --> 01:22:08,570
Come here.

726
01:22:12,490 --> 01:22:13,540
Be quick.

727
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:15,020
What are you doing? Come on.

728
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:52,430
Experiment subject Alpha.

729
01:22:53,390 --> 01:23:01,240
Experiment subject Alpha has the side effect
of conducting indiscriminate violence.

730
01:23:01,930 --> 01:23:08,430
And it shows that Alpha
suffers from severe trauma.

731
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:22,330
Why does it stop?

732
01:23:22,990 --> 01:23:23,990
Why does it stop?

733
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:46,990
Just go down quickly.

734
01:23:52,190 --> 01:23:53,860
Alpha only reacts to people's behaviour.

735
01:23:54,390 --> 01:23:56,720
It preserves the genetic
characteristics of wolf.

736
01:23:57,170 --> 01:24:01,790
And it's sensitive about
sound and the smell of blood.

737
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:08,140
It is 5 times stronger than normal human.

738
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:09,700
Get down.

739
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:16,760
Oh shit, Its not opening.

740
01:24:19,030 --> 01:24:20,820
It won't open.

741
01:24:21,870 --> 01:24:28,590
What's more, according to the fact that
cellular aging doesn't happen on its body.

742
01:24:29,710 --> 01:24:37,710
It can live much longer which indicates
the new possibility of human's evolution.

743
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:43,800
It's the same as cancer cell.

744
01:24:47,020 --> 01:24:48,850
They are crazy.

745
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:50,990
How much longer do people want to be alive?

746
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:56,350
The whole world is crazy.

747
01:24:57,380 --> 01:24:58,460
Are there more about Alpha?

748
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:00,690
Wait a second.

749
01:25:00,990 --> 01:25:02,690
I think we can find more.

750
01:25:03,470 --> 01:25:04,470
I will take a look.

751
01:25:18,110 --> 01:25:21,900
The third laboratory is Japan's
concentration camp in the Philippines.

752
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:39,380
Stop taking photos.

753
01:26:07,190 --> 01:26:13,250
The surgery has finished successfully.

754
01:26:53,210 --> 01:26:54,210
What's going on?

755
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:20,780
Kill it.

756
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:32,040
Bastard.

757
01:27:39,890 --> 01:27:40,890
Help!

758
01:27:41,850 --> 01:27:43,220
Don't come to me. Go away.

759
01:27:51,690 --> 01:27:52,730
Hold on.

760
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:36,300
Stop it.

761
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:50,540
Let him go.

762
01:29:00,980 --> 01:29:04,520
Sir, sir, do something.

763
01:29:13,660 --> 01:29:15,500
Help!

764
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:37,840
Son of a bitch.

765
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:40,157
I won't let you go.

766
01:29:40,181 --> 01:29:41,400
Let's die together.

767
01:29:43,090 --> 01:29:44,090
No.

768
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:50,840
My dear.

769
01:29:51,140 --> 01:29:52,140
My dear.

770
01:29:54,460 --> 01:29:55,117
I am sorry.

771
01:29:55,141 --> 01:29:59,450
Shit, just get up now.

772
01:30:15,390 --> 01:30:16,390
What's that sound?

773
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:18,130
Let's go.

774
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:19,280
OK.

775
01:30:27,970 --> 01:30:28,970
My dear.

776
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:39,916
Go.

777
01:30:39,940 --> 01:30:41,940
Hurry up.

778
01:30:50,380 --> 01:30:52,320
Officer, this is Kim Tae Jun speaking.

779
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:55,520
Frontier Titan has been
found 20 minutes ago.

780
01:30:55,900 --> 01:30:57,830
It is detected as remaining still.

781
01:30:57,960 --> 01:30:58,960
Ok.

782
01:31:00,380 --> 01:31:01,380
Get ready.

783
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:43,160
What's that.

784
01:32:13,220 --> 01:32:14,220
Come on.

785
01:32:32,870 --> 01:32:33,447
What are you doing?

786
01:32:33,471 --> 01:32:34,660
Don't come out.

787
01:32:42,470 --> 01:32:43,470
Shit.

788
01:34:04,060 --> 01:34:08,560
I should at least break your arm so that

789
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:13,850
I can say something to my
friends who have been sacrificed.

790
01:34:16,690 --> 01:34:17,690
Son of a bitch.

791
01:36:14,300 --> 01:36:15,620
It's the sound of helicopter.

792
01:36:16,100 --> 01:36:17,750
They come to save us, right?

793
01:36:18,760 --> 01:36:20,120
Did you contact Korean government?

794
01:36:20,860 --> 01:36:22,660
- No, there's no signal.
- Maybe it's captain.

795
01:36:25,950 --> 01:36:27,420
Yes, that's it.

796
01:36:29,140 --> 01:36:29,760
Where are you going?

797
01:36:30,070 --> 01:36:31,070
Be quick.

798
01:36:31,300 --> 01:36:32,300
Wait for me.

799
01:37:01,590 --> 01:37:03,590
Are you the guys with helicopter?

800
01:37:13,820 --> 01:37:15,300
Those people are...

801
01:37:19,820 --> 01:37:25,600
There's a psycho acting like a
monster and killing everyone.

802
01:37:25,980 --> 01:37:27,120
Like a monster?

803
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:29,276
The police are also killed.

804
01:37:29,300 --> 01:37:31,736
The monster is killing everyone.

805
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:33,920
And he kills people like he kills a bug.

806
01:37:34,930 --> 01:37:35,690
I have no idea.

807
01:37:35,940 --> 01:37:37,180
I don't know.

808
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:38,086
I have no idea.

809
01:37:38,110 --> 01:37:38,740
I need to get out of here.

810
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:40,990
Help me.

811
01:37:45,230 --> 01:37:47,620
Bitch, you are too noisy.

812
01:37:48,090 --> 01:37:50,840
Blah Blah blah, you are talking too much.

813
01:37:51,340 --> 01:37:52,660
I have no time.

814
01:38:06,460 --> 01:38:07,460
I am the police.

815
01:38:09,150 --> 01:38:10,150
Don't move.

816
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:20,970
What are you showing off, bitch?

817
01:38:21,620 --> 01:38:24,090
You should have done your job better.

818
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:27,350
I just need you to arrive Taiwan.

819
01:38:28,890 --> 01:38:29,890
Is it so hard?

820
01:38:34,130 --> 01:38:35,920
Shit, all of you are dumb.

821
01:38:46,810 --> 01:38:47,810
Let's go.

822
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:49,090
Let's go.

823
01:38:49,700 --> 01:38:50,930
Put down your guns.

824
01:38:52,890 --> 01:38:53,890
Who are you?

825
01:38:54,460 --> 01:38:58,220
You are still contemptible.

826
01:39:05,300 --> 01:39:08,120
It's you, bastard.

827
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:10,960
How have you been?

828
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:30,120
You expect to get on the ship with Alpha
and arrive in Korea to find us, right?

829
01:39:33,350 --> 01:39:37,480
That's why you give me so much trouble.

830
01:39:38,780 --> 01:39:39,810
You should have known.

831
01:39:41,750 --> 01:39:42,750
Why did you do that?

832
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:45,000
What are you talking about?

833
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:51,250
We make a good use of those
people who are going to die.

834
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:52,600
Is that wrong?

835
01:39:54,060 --> 01:39:55,200
It's not me.

836
01:39:55,680 --> 01:39:56,680
Don't lie to me.

837
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:58,480
You kill them.

838
01:40:00,450 --> 01:40:01,450
No.

839
01:40:02,450 --> 01:40:03,450
I said it's not me.

840
01:40:03,710 --> 01:40:04,920
Go to hell.

841
01:40:21,690 --> 01:40:24,460
Today's goods are so fresh.

842
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:26,550
Son of a bitch.

843
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:33,770
Hurry up and pack them up.

844
01:42:32,420 --> 01:42:33,700
Come on, pigs.

845
01:42:34,260 --> 01:42:35,206
It's lucnch time.

846
01:42:35,230 --> 01:42:36,230
Come on, pigs.

847
01:42:36,700 --> 01:42:37,790
Come on, pigs.

848
01:42:50,540 --> 01:42:54,206
Today's winner in the game
earns 30 points more than the loser.

849
01:42:54,230 --> 01:42:55,240
Are you all right?

850
01:43:05,900 --> 01:43:07,870
We saved you.

851
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:12,750
But you bastards don't know how
to be grateful and bring me trouble.

852
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:17,640
You won't get hurt and old.

853
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:19,220
It's so wonderful.

854
01:43:20,020 --> 01:43:21,480
I understand.

855
01:43:22,220 --> 01:43:24,100
You should have come with the faculty.

856
01:43:24,940 --> 01:43:26,730
Why did you make me find you by myself?

857
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:39,460
Is it a son or a daughter?

858
01:43:41,050 --> 01:43:43,290
It has been a long time
ago. I don't even remember.

859
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:50,990
Son of a bitch.

860
01:44:11,380 --> 01:44:12,750
That guy appears again.

861
01:44:12,860 --> 01:44:14,340
Oh no.

862
01:44:25,900 --> 01:44:28,940
Why does this guy intervene.

863
01:44:30,110 --> 01:44:31,220
Let's just take his head.

864
01:44:32,140 --> 01:44:33,140
Fire.

865
01:45:36,490 --> 01:45:37,516
These guys are useless.

866
01:45:37,540 --> 01:45:38,540
Hilarious

867
01:45:58,030 --> 01:45:59,030
Come this way.

868
01:45:59,070 --> 01:46:00,070
Come on.

869
01:46:19,020 --> 01:46:21,960
Actually, It's a pity to kill you.

870
01:46:52,040 --> 01:46:53,040
Don't move.

871
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Who are you?

872
01:46:55,580 --> 01:46:56,580
You don't need to know.

873
01:46:57,060 --> 01:46:58,100
Take us to Korea.

874
01:46:59,260 --> 01:47:00,260
I can't.

875
01:47:00,830 --> 01:47:02,070
The helicopter needs refueling.

876
01:47:06,540 --> 01:47:07,880
Shit, What can we do?

877
01:47:10,530 --> 01:47:12,000
Find out the nearest place to go.

878
01:47:12,050 --> 01:47:14,000
Please get out of this place.

879
01:48:05,590 --> 01:48:06,590
What a pity.

880
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:36,600
This bastard has died.

881
01:48:37,810 --> 01:48:40,390
I should at least take you
back so that I won't be blamed.

882
01:48:41,810 --> 01:48:42,810
Am I right?

883
01:48:54,420 --> 01:48:58,780
Animals shouldn't imitate humans.

884
01:50:15,050 --> 01:50:19,770
Just come with me
when I talk gently to you.

885
01:50:43,010 --> 01:50:44,880
Otherwise, things will
be really bad for you.

886
01:50:47,060 --> 01:50:48,920
Now I remember when I see you like this.

887
01:50:49,890 --> 01:50:51,810
Father, father.

888
01:50:54,160 --> 01:50:56,360
Now I remember your baby's face.

889
01:51:11,100 --> 01:51:19,100
.

890
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:12,590
It's not easy to move them.

891
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:19,450
It's a better idea that we should
get it done here instead of in Korea.

892
01:52:27,460 --> 01:52:28,750
Well I am not sure about that.

893
01:52:28,930 --> 01:52:30,326
They are so wild and aggressive.

894
01:52:30,350 --> 01:52:31,810
It's not easy.

895
01:52:32,150 --> 01:52:34,200
And not to mention the cost of management.

896
01:52:35,510 --> 01:52:37,620
We will pay for it.

897
01:52:44,610 --> 01:52:51,000
Our work is inherently dangerous.

898
01:53:08,260 --> 01:53:10,320
They are animals which can't even talk.

899
01:53:11,610 --> 01:53:12,660
Please understand.

900
01:53:21,580 --> 01:53:22,580
Please.
