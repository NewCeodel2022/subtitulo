00:03:14,184 --> 00:03:16,766
It's been 4 weeks since
I asked for a nanny.

4
00:03:18,016 --> 00:03:21,307
If you tell me you're still looking,
how should I respond?

5
00:03:22,975 --> 00:03:26,557
I told you many times,
I don't care about paying more.

6
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:30,641
I said it's urgent for work.

7
00:03:34,141 --> 00:03:36,140
Please look for a nanny properly.

8
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:51,308
Ina, our new home is

9
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,723
really quiet and has clean air too.

10
00:03:55,767 --> 00:03:58,807
The doctor said it'd be good for you.

11
00:03:59,683 --> 00:04:03,057
Once you live there,
you'll grow to love it.

12
00:04:09,142 --> 00:04:10,266
Sweetie.

13
00:04:10,974 --> 00:04:12,474
That doll there,

14
00:04:12,515 --> 00:04:13,807
it's a limited edition.

15
00:04:13,932 --> 00:04:16,099
It was really hard getting it.

16
00:04:17,017 --> 00:04:18,892
You should be thanking me.

WRITTEN AND DIRECTED
BY KIM KWANG-BIN

18
00:05:04,557 --> 00:05:05,598
Ina!

19
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:08,890
Yeon Ina!

20
00:05:19,017 --> 00:05:20,184
Ina!

21
00:05:46,223 --> 00:05:47,141
Sweetie!

22
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:50,349
You can't run off like that,
I looked everywhere for you.

23
00:06:01,683 --> 00:06:04,516
Ina, that's our new home.

24
00:06:05,308 --> 00:06:06,432
Do you like it?

25
00:07:29,183 --> 00:07:30,849
"You should've come early."

26
00:07:31,557 --> 00:07:33,306
"You missed Ina getting the award."

27
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,058
You know about my new project.

28
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:40,016
It's a state of emergency.

29
00:07:40,058 --> 00:07:42,431
Do you even know
what your birthday gift to her was?

30
00:07:43,058 --> 00:07:44,682
It's this necklace.

31
00:07:45,391 --> 00:07:48,474
She wears it everyday since
I told her it's from you.

32
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,349
Honey!

33
00:08:12,683 --> 00:08:15,307
"Panic attack isn't something
that gets better with some rest."

34
00:08:16,059 --> 00:08:17,390
"It needs constant care."

35
00:08:18,225 --> 00:08:19,850
Or you'll have seizures again.

36
00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:24,642
Set an alarm and medicate regularly.

37
00:08:24,683 --> 00:08:29,390
I can take care of myself,
but Ina's not getting better.

38
00:08:29,557 --> 00:08:31,182
"Is she in bad shape?"

39
00:08:31,225 --> 00:08:33,141
She won't even lock eyes with me.

40
00:08:33,641 --> 00:08:36,348
- "She'll get better in clean air environment."
- (Architect of the Year)

41
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,057
"You moved there for that reason."

42
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:43,017
It's just frustrating,
I'm doing everything possible.

43
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:48,015
"The last resort would be
the art camp I mentioned,"

44
00:08:48,558 --> 00:08:51,391
"but you two will be apart,
so I don't recommend it."

45
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:55,350
"You're in treatment too,
that's what worries me."

46
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,307
I'm more concerned with her.

47
00:09:04,891 --> 00:09:06,932
"Dad, watch me run!"

48
00:09:06,975 --> 00:09:09,517
"Okay, my little star, do your best!"

49
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:15,973
Yeah, listen to me.

50
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:20,057
Wasn't I supposed to handle everything
from concept to finish?

51
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:22,140
"But you're never here."

52
00:09:22,182 --> 00:09:24,057
I'm not saying I won't go!

53
00:09:24,099 --> 00:09:25,515
It's because of the kid!

54
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:29,391
Listen, this is a unilateral
contract termination.

55
00:09:29,433 --> 00:09:30,642
Am I wrong?

56
00:09:32,265 --> 00:09:34,849
Let's talk face-to-face,
I'll come to the site.

57
00:09:35,766 --> 00:09:38,599
"Happy birthday to you!"

58
00:09:38,642 --> 00:09:42,100
"My lovely Ina,"

59
00:09:42,141 --> 00:09:44,974
"happy birthday to you!"

60
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,181
"Blow out the candles,"

61
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,766
"or I will."

62
00:09:49,808 --> 00:09:51,015
"No way!"

63
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:57,516
- "What was your wish?"
- "Secret!"

64
00:09:58,141 --> 00:10:00,308
- "You won't tell me?"
- "Nope!"

65
00:11:54,558 --> 00:11:55,517
Ina!

66
00:12:02,267 --> 00:12:03,349
What happened, sweetie?

67
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,974
Did you scream just now?

68
00:12:06,724 --> 00:12:08,307
I didn't scream.

69
00:12:10,224 --> 00:12:11,556
Is everything okay?

70
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:12,516
Yup.

71
00:12:17,517 --> 00:12:18,974
Can I come in for a bit?

72
00:12:19,724 --> 00:12:20,641
Yup.

73
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,181
That's weird.

74
00:12:27,933 --> 00:12:29,641
You really didn't scream?

75
00:12:29,684 --> 00:12:30,808
Nope.

76
00:12:42,057 --> 00:12:43,641
Where did you get that doll?

77
00:12:44,642 --> 00:12:45,808
It was in here.

78
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:47,725
- In there?
- Yup.

79
00:12:48,808 --> 00:12:49,890
Hold on.

80
00:12:58,267 --> 00:13:02,433
You know that doll I bought you recently?

81
00:13:02,475 --> 00:13:04,392
I think it'd be more fun to play with that.

82
00:13:05,182 --> 00:13:07,432
Dad, can I keep this?

83
00:13:07,474 --> 00:13:09,683
Someone else played with it, it's dirty.

84
00:13:09,724 --> 00:13:11,098
Give it to me, I'll throw it out.

85
00:13:11,474 --> 00:13:15,723
I want to play with both dolls.

86
00:13:21,558 --> 00:13:22,682
Are you really okay?

87
00:13:23,225 --> 00:13:24,183
Yup.

88
00:13:25,933 --> 00:13:26,850
All right.

89
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,557
Sleep early.

90
00:13:30,932 --> 00:13:32,014
Okay.

91
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,224
Thank you for the meal.

92
00:14:12,266 --> 00:14:15,057
Dad, can I play in my room?

93
00:14:15,975 --> 00:14:17,057
You want to?

94
00:14:32,641 --> 00:14:33,890
I like this house.

95
00:14:35,224 --> 00:14:36,723
I got a friend too.

96
00:14:39,266 --> 00:14:41,182
That's great, Ina, thank you.

97
00:14:53,975 --> 00:14:55,682
"Why is Hyun-sang in the conversation?"

98
00:14:56,433 --> 00:14:59,722
If we share the design,
the concept will get tangled up.

99
00:15:00,391 --> 00:15:02,932
What does he know about galleries?

100
00:15:02,974 --> 00:15:04,681
He hasn't even done a 2-floor cabin.

101
00:15:05,766 --> 00:15:09,141
While you were on leave,
he did a gallery in Jeju.

102
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,849
He's doing well, like you in your prime.

103
00:15:13,932 --> 00:15:15,474
Honestly,

104
00:15:16,058 --> 00:15:19,015
they just wanted him, but I championed you.

105
00:15:19,308 --> 00:15:20,475
What a load of crap...

106
00:15:21,099 --> 00:15:22,682
The boss is asking,

107
00:15:23,141 --> 00:15:26,806
how an architect designs
when he's not even on site.

108
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,766
It's all been agreed to!

109
00:15:28,808 --> 00:15:31,267
I'd come down as soon as I find a nanny!

110
00:15:32,058 --> 00:15:34,682
It's been over a month now.

111
00:15:34,724 --> 00:15:36,349
We're out of time.

112
00:15:38,433 --> 00:15:40,515
Why is he here?

113
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,933
Yeah, that's odd.

114
00:15:43,683 --> 00:15:46,099
Why is Hyun-sang here? Out on a stroll?

115
00:15:48,308 --> 00:15:50,307
So it's already been decided.

116
00:15:52,142 --> 00:15:53,308
No way, dude.

117
00:15:56,142 --> 00:15:59,182
I'll come down, so get rid of him.

118
00:16:00,267 --> 00:16:01,559
What?

119
00:16:01,599 --> 00:16:03,349
I'll report to the site!

120
00:16:42,933 --> 00:16:45,016
"Stop moving!"

121
00:16:45,057 --> 00:16:46,682
"Don't fool around!"

122
00:16:46,724 --> 00:16:49,764
"Hold on!"

123
00:16:55,391 --> 00:16:57,098
Ina, what were you doing?

124
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,598
I was making a song for you.

125
00:17:00,766 --> 00:17:02,099
Wanna hear it?

126
00:17:05,516 --> 00:17:06,433
Ina.

127
00:17:08,267 --> 00:17:10,224
I have to tell you something.

128
00:17:11,517 --> 00:17:15,017
Remember how I said I was designing
a museum in Tongyeong?

129
00:17:15,808 --> 00:17:18,099
That job is starting,

130
00:17:18,141 --> 00:17:20,889
so I need to work at the
site for a little while.

131
00:17:21,765 --> 00:17:25,806
A nanny will stay here with you.

132
00:17:27,183 --> 00:17:28,308
How long?

133
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:29,849
About 2 months?

134
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:32,265
But I'll come home every
weekend to see you.

135
00:17:33,141 --> 00:17:35,223
Can I come with you?

136
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:39,140
I really want you to come with me,

137
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,557
but it's a construction
site, so it's bad for you.

138
00:17:42,058 --> 00:17:46,724
If you're understanding and help me out,

139
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:48,932
I'll buy you a present.

140
00:17:50,474 --> 00:17:52,640
You were gonna do whatever you want.

141
00:17:53,766 --> 00:17:54,933
Why bother asking?

142
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,808
Honey.

143
00:18:03,558 --> 00:18:05,515
I'm not doing whatever I want,

144
00:18:06,516 --> 00:18:09,224
I want to find a way together.

145
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,516
But if you always give me
an attitude like this,

146
00:18:13,557 --> 00:18:15,848
I don't know what to do.

147
00:18:18,016 --> 00:18:22,056
Could you try to understand
and think in my shoes?

148
00:18:23,058 --> 00:18:26,558
I'll think about what you want.

149
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,725
Ina, let's talk again.

150
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:30,432
Ina, it's late, get to bed!

151
00:23:01,265 --> 00:23:04,222
(Decide if you'll come or not by tomorrow.)

152
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:13,515
"How is the art camp treatment done?"

153
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,100
"They'll start with isolation treatment."

154
00:23:16,849 --> 00:23:18,432
"Will she be okay?"

155
00:23:18,474 --> 00:23:20,599
"Being away from me, since
her mom's gone too."

156
00:23:21,516 --> 00:23:23,975
"It won't be easy, but what can you do?"

157
00:23:24,016 --> 00:23:25,389
"It's too much for you."

158
00:23:26,307 --> 00:23:29,640
"They take only a few kids,
so you'll need to donate."

159
00:23:30,223 --> 00:23:31,598
"Think about it."

160
00:23:35,099 --> 00:23:36,307
Where are you going?

161
00:23:39,349 --> 00:23:41,723
Ina, I'm going to the site for a bit.

162
00:23:41,767 --> 00:23:42,849
I'll be right back.

163
00:23:42,891 --> 00:23:44,264
You said we'll talk again.

164
00:23:45,017 --> 00:23:47,432
Can't think of what to buy me?

165
00:23:49,099 --> 00:23:50,181
Ina.

166
00:23:51,433 --> 00:23:52,891
Let's talk tonight.

167
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:56,891
And that doll in New York, I ordered it.

168
00:23:56,933 --> 00:23:58,306
It'll arrive soon.

169
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:05,307
Do you know how old I am?
I don't need those dumb dolls.

170
00:24:06,058 --> 00:24:07,098
Ina.

171
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,849
You said you liked that doll.

172
00:24:11,017 --> 00:24:13,099
And why are you talking
like that to your dad?

173
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,181
Why do you decide what I like?

174
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,265
Then tell me what you really like!

175
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:22,432
I don't need anything.

176
00:24:23,933 --> 00:24:25,973
- Calls himself 'dad'...
- What?

177
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:28,599
- Ina.
- Let go.

178
00:24:30,183 --> 00:24:32,599
Let go! Let go!

179
00:24:32,641 --> 00:24:33,973
Let go!

180
00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:36,140
Let go! Let go!

181
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,474
Let go! Let go!

182
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,599
D'you ask for a nanny?

183
00:24:58,183 --> 00:25:00,933
Yes, hello, I was just heading out.

184
00:25:00,974 --> 00:25:02,973
$150 for a day.

185
00:25:04,891 --> 00:25:06,098
Okay.

186
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:18,682
Do-hyun, that donation to the art camp,

187
00:25:19,098 --> 00:25:20,515
how much would be enough?

188
00:25:30,099 --> 00:25:31,849
They're pretty well off.

189
00:25:32,849 --> 00:25:35,432
The kid's in her room, doing whatever.

190
00:25:37,933 --> 00:25:39,182
No wife.

191
00:25:39,557 --> 00:25:43,724
Who knows, maybe she ran off.

192
00:25:44,766 --> 00:25:47,473
He stashed all the expensive stuff.

193
00:25:47,517 --> 00:25:49,683
It's so my style.

194
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:09,934
Hey.

195
00:26:10,683 --> 00:26:11,432
This is Mr. Park.

196
00:26:11,474 --> 00:26:13,139
- Good work.
- It's so nice to meet you.

197
00:26:13,182 --> 00:26:15,515
- This is Mr. Kim.
- Great to meet you.

198
00:26:15,558 --> 00:26:16,599
Good to meet you, sir.

199
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:18,932
- Shall we go inside and talk?
- Sure.

200
00:26:19,517 --> 00:26:23,350
She's screaming and
smashing shit in her room.

201
00:26:23,849 --> 00:26:26,307
She doesn't eat no matter what I make.

202
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:29,516
She'll wise up when she starves.

203
00:26:47,224 --> 00:26:48,681
Crazy little bitch!

204
00:26:49,849 --> 00:26:53,431
She started today, how
could she just leave?

205
00:26:55,391 --> 00:26:58,014
Stop giving me a load of shit.

206
00:26:58,057 --> 00:27:01,682
I'll head home tonight, so
keep her there till then.

207
00:27:01,725 --> 00:27:05,391
If she took the money,
she must be responsible!

208
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,223
I can't go right now!

209
00:27:11,724 --> 00:27:12,848
Okay.

210
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:18,266
(Talked to art camp director,
send her next week.)

211
00:27:49,641 --> 00:27:51,224
I want to go too,

212
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,350
take me with you.

213
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:08,766
"Come with us..."

214
00:28:08,808 --> 00:28:13,015
"We'll take you with us..."

215
00:28:53,975 --> 00:28:58,557
"Missing Child: Yeon Ina (female, 11)"

216
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:03,766
Thank you all.

217
00:29:19,474 --> 00:29:20,724
She's not my daughter.

218
00:29:22,225 --> 00:29:26,350
She's been missing for a month,
and you got nothing?

219
00:29:27,141 --> 00:29:28,933
It's killing us too.

220
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,517
Nothing comes up at all.

221
00:29:31,308 --> 00:29:32,766
That nanny I hired,

222
00:29:32,807 --> 00:29:35,557
Ina disappeared shortly after she left.

223
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,517
Let's investigate her once more.

224
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,724
We checked the dash cam
from the car she drove that day,

225
00:29:40,767 --> 00:29:43,391
and we even did a lie detector test.

226
00:29:43,432 --> 00:29:44,932
She's clean.

227
00:29:44,975 --> 00:29:46,683
Please go home and wait.

228
00:29:46,724 --> 00:29:49,098
You've been telling me to go home
and wait for a month!

229
00:29:49,141 --> 00:29:50,684
Are you investigating properly?!

230
00:29:50,724 --> 00:29:53,473
Why the hell are you lashing out at me?!

231
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:59,307
- All done.
- Okay.

232
00:30:05,475 --> 00:30:06,474
All right, Mr. Yeon,

233
00:30:06,517 --> 00:30:08,016
please look at the camera.

234
00:30:09,392 --> 00:30:13,057
You can speak freely about Ina.

235
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:22,683
Hello, I'm Yeon Sang-won.

236
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:27,057
This is my daughter, Ina.

237
00:30:28,099 --> 00:30:29,557
She's 11 years old,

238
00:30:30,307 --> 00:30:35,182
and she disappeared about a month ago.

239
00:30:37,474 --> 00:30:41,599
I really want to find her, please help.

240
00:30:45,808 --> 00:30:49,723
"We scoured all security cams,"

241
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:52,641
"and dash cams in 3km vicinity,"

242
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,933
"but we did not see any traces of her."

243
00:30:55,974 --> 00:30:59,849
"Her mother died in a car
accident last year,"

244
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,391
"and she lived with her dad."

245
00:31:01,975 --> 00:31:06,015
"According to people around them,
they weren't in good terms."

246
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:12,684
"While filming,
we stumbled upon a dozen pill containers."

247
00:31:13,849 --> 00:31:15,889
"They're all used to
treat mental illnesses."

248
00:31:16,765 --> 00:31:19,974
"The medication shows
his illnesses must be serious,"

249
00:31:20,015 --> 00:31:22,640
"and he may be experiencing
overlapping symptoms."

250
00:31:23,266 --> 00:31:26,889
"He was so fixated on work,
to the point that I felt bad."

251
00:31:27,641 --> 00:31:31,141
"Maybe because he took some time off,"

252
00:31:31,182 --> 00:31:32,931
"he looked nervous and anxious."

253
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:36,391
"Unfortunately, many of
the missing child cases"

254
00:31:36,808 --> 00:31:39,807
"are linked to family members."

255
00:31:40,641 --> 00:31:44,723
"Remember the Mi-jin case
we introduced 3 years ago?"

256
00:31:45,683 --> 00:31:51,392
"There are many similarities
between these two cases."

257
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:55,015
"Perhaps this is the point"

258
00:31:55,058 --> 00:31:59,349
"where we need to look at the case
from another angle."

259
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:03,058
"A girl who disappeared
from inside her home,"

260
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,474
"where could she be now?"

261
00:32:06,516 --> 00:32:09,015
"We're waiting for your tips."

262
00:32:12,724 --> 00:32:14,266
Is this "Behind the Story"?

263
00:32:20,307 --> 00:32:23,390
(Her dad is suspicious.)

264
00:32:24,224 --> 00:32:25,557
Man...

265
00:32:33,558 --> 00:32:35,099
(There is no Internet connection.)

266
00:32:43,391 --> 00:32:44,432
"Tada!"

267
00:32:44,766 --> 00:32:46,807
"This is a gift from dad."

268
00:32:46,849 --> 00:32:48,349
"A butterfly necklace!"

269
00:32:50,224 --> 00:32:51,348
"It's so pretty!"

270
00:32:52,141 --> 00:32:53,724
"You love it that much?"

271
00:32:54,433 --> 00:32:55,889
"Do you want to thank dad?"

272
00:32:56,225 --> 00:32:58,058
"Thank you, dad!"

273
00:34:27,933 --> 00:34:29,266
Who are you?

274
00:34:29,308 --> 00:34:31,849
Hello, you called for
an internet technician?

275
00:34:32,058 --> 00:34:33,474
The door was open.

276
00:34:34,434 --> 00:34:36,225
This house is so big,

277
00:34:36,267 --> 00:34:38,599
I'll need to look around
to find the problem.

278
00:34:40,267 --> 00:34:43,058
This house is humungous.

279
00:34:44,725 --> 00:34:46,225
Are you an artist?

280
00:34:47,017 --> 00:34:49,099
Or are you making a house?

281
00:34:49,891 --> 00:34:52,724
I've always wanted
to live in a big house like this.

282
00:34:53,349 --> 00:34:55,681
But my family was poor.

283
00:34:56,558 --> 00:34:57,599
It's not here.

284
00:34:58,308 --> 00:35:00,141
How do you clean a house like this?

285
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:01,765
You'll tire yourself out doing it alone.

286
00:35:01,807 --> 00:35:03,472
Do you get a maid?

287
00:35:05,017 --> 00:35:06,892
Really high ceiling too.

288
00:35:06,933 --> 00:35:09,142
Do you get really high heating bills?

289
00:35:09,558 --> 00:35:12,683
I'm sure you get government subsidies
for solar panels,

290
00:35:12,725 --> 00:35:15,765
but you can't tell how efficient
those panels are, right?

291
00:35:17,433 --> 00:35:19,182
How much is it per square foot?

292
00:35:19,225 --> 00:35:20,557
Higher than Gangnam?

293
00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:23,932
You can ask the real estate agency.

294
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,432
Could you just get to fixing the internet?

295
00:35:27,266 --> 00:35:30,639
There are cable problems
out here in the country.

296
00:35:30,683 --> 00:35:33,516
So the EMF...

297
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:47,557
So I'm using an EMF detector
to check the condition.

298
00:35:49,308 --> 00:35:51,639
Is this how you fix the internet?

299
00:35:53,683 --> 00:35:54,765
May I?

300
00:35:55,807 --> 00:35:56,765
Sure.

301
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,932
Excuse me?

302
00:36:12,975 --> 00:36:14,475
Could I get your business card?

303
00:36:14,516 --> 00:36:16,599
Wait a minute, that's not important,

304
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,931
I'm about to solve the problem.

305
00:36:37,641 --> 00:36:40,808
I checked the terminal box just in case,

306
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,891
and someone had cut the cable.

307
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,557
What did you say?

308
00:36:45,391 --> 00:36:47,600
Didn't you call for an internet technician?

309
00:36:49,975 --> 00:36:53,142
Sir, could we be civil and talk about this?

310
00:36:53,184 --> 00:36:54,557
Listen to me, will you?

311
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,100
Wait a minute!

312
00:36:55,142 --> 00:36:56,349
Who the hell are you?

313
00:36:59,142 --> 00:37:00,391
Don't take it the wrong way.

314
00:37:00,975 --> 00:37:03,475
I needed to check something,
I'm here to help you.

315
00:37:03,515 --> 00:37:06,140
Are you from the TV show?
I'm not getting fooled twice.

316
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:08,391
I'm calling the cops.

317
00:37:10,433 --> 00:37:13,225
Didn't Ina's personality change before
she disappeared?

318
00:37:13,266 --> 00:37:16,390
Acting weird, talking to herself
or screaming in front of the closet.

319
00:37:19,975 --> 00:37:21,099
How did you know that?

320
00:37:21,142 --> 00:37:23,349
Ina isn't the first child
to disappear in her house.

321
00:37:24,059 --> 00:37:26,474
32 kids have disappeared since 1998,

322
00:37:26,515 --> 00:37:28,016
and I've been at it for 10 years.

323
00:37:29,849 --> 00:37:33,390
If you Google 'Exorcist
Heo', you'll find me.

324
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:37,683
I've been blogged many times
and went on TV shows too.

325
00:37:37,725 --> 00:37:39,099
(Exorcism at your
service)(Exorcist Heo Kyung-hoon)

326
00:37:39,142 --> 00:37:42,183
When it comes to exorcism,
I'm pretty much No.1 in Korea.

327
00:37:42,224 --> 00:37:45,432
Top class fame and skills
but with reasonable rates,

328
00:37:45,933 --> 00:37:47,475
like this.

329
00:37:53,725 --> 00:37:55,390
Take a look at this first.

330
00:37:58,558 --> 00:38:00,808
They all disappeared from their homes.

331
00:38:01,892 --> 00:38:04,974
Playing, doing homework, sleeping,

332
00:38:06,142 --> 00:38:08,432
they all vanished without a trace.

333
00:38:10,975 --> 00:38:12,475
They drew those drawings.

334
00:38:13,808 --> 00:38:15,807
They all point to a child.

335
00:38:20,932 --> 00:38:24,141
A girl named Hyun-soo disappeared
like Ina 20 years ago.

336
00:38:25,766 --> 00:38:29,389
Her parents set up this ritual
to find out if she was dead.

337
00:39:04,558 --> 00:39:07,641
You saw her, right? That's my mom.

338
00:39:09,475 --> 00:39:12,183
A few parents of the missing kids said so,

339
00:39:12,223 --> 00:39:13,890
that they saw her.

340
00:39:16,642 --> 00:39:18,974
I think she was trying to warn them,

341
00:39:19,016 --> 00:39:20,891
trying to stop it from taking the kids.

342
00:39:24,475 --> 00:39:25,642
Shall I continue?

343
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:37,348
She killed my mom, took the children,

344
00:39:37,391 --> 00:39:38,892
and now Ina too.

345
00:39:40,683 --> 00:39:41,558
It's her.

346
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,974
The source of everything, a demonic child.

347
00:40:00,349 --> 00:40:02,015
How am I supposed to take this in?

348
00:40:02,891 --> 00:40:04,515
Does this make sense to you?

349
00:40:05,017 --> 00:40:06,558
A ghost took my child?

350
00:40:07,391 --> 00:40:09,308
You're just trying to
get paid for a ritual!

351
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:10,682
Are you out of your mind?!

352
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:16,140
Get out, leave.

353
00:40:24,225 --> 00:40:27,224
Don't believe me? Okay.

354
00:40:29,767 --> 00:40:32,099
I'm the only one who believe you.

355
00:40:32,141 --> 00:40:34,642
Everyone thinks you killed her.

356
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:39,765
If it's delayed any longer,
she'll be lost forever.

357
00:40:47,557 --> 00:40:48,598
Wait.

358
00:40:54,892 --> 00:40:56,557
Can you really find her?

359
00:41:01,642 --> 00:41:02,390
Yes.

360
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:11,308
Spirit of the living remains
in the underworld for 49 days,

361
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:12,850
so-called '49-day memorial rite'.

362
00:41:13,725 --> 00:41:17,724
It's easily explained in the movie
"Along with the Gods".

363
00:41:20,682 --> 00:41:22,182
You didn't see that movie?

364
00:41:22,225 --> 00:41:23,391
Never got to.

365
00:41:23,433 --> 00:41:25,140
I thought you were cultured.

366
00:41:25,933 --> 00:41:29,223
In any case, Ina has only 3 days left.

367
00:41:29,892 --> 00:41:30,850
3 days.

368
00:41:35,183 --> 00:41:37,725
This is a detector that finds

369
00:41:38,307 --> 00:41:41,432
objects with wavelengths
beyond quantum mechanics.

370
00:41:45,432 --> 00:41:47,473
When ghosts appear, this reacts to them.

371
00:41:53,474 --> 00:41:55,974
So where exactly is Ina right now?

372
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,183
Realm of the dead.

373
00:42:01,724 --> 00:42:03,224
We call it the dark realm.

374
00:42:05,725 --> 00:42:07,182
It means...

375
00:42:09,182 --> 00:42:11,057
- Let me take a page...
- Don't tear that.

376
00:42:11,766 --> 00:42:13,057
Jeez...

377
00:42:24,558 --> 00:42:25,641
Take a look.

378
00:42:26,475 --> 00:42:30,934
Realm of the living is separated
from realm of the dead.

379
00:42:30,974 --> 00:42:32,306
They share the side.

380
00:42:32,391 --> 00:42:35,057
They're stepping on the same space,

381
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:37,974
but they can't see each other
because of the border.

382
00:42:38,015 --> 00:42:42,389
But if the resonance frequency is in sync,

383
00:42:43,767 --> 00:42:45,391
they can see each other.

384
00:42:46,391 --> 00:42:47,683
They can cross realms.

385
00:42:48,391 --> 00:42:49,892
Like the movie "Interstellar".

386
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:54,809
The shaman exorcism is like scrubbing
the radio frequency.

387
00:42:55,517 --> 00:42:57,265
It's often called 'possession'.

388
00:42:58,307 --> 00:43:01,557
This happens frequently,
so I need protection.

389
00:43:09,517 --> 00:43:11,725
There is a breed of ghosts
that are especially malicious.

390
00:43:12,308 --> 00:43:13,973
Like the demon we're after.

391
00:43:15,016 --> 00:43:18,225
They find people who sync up
and drag them to their realm.

392
00:43:19,099 --> 00:43:23,265
The victims lose their memories over time,
and are left with only malice.

393
00:43:24,516 --> 00:43:26,515
They become the Blinded.

394
00:43:26,557 --> 00:43:29,349
Once they lock eyes,
they'll swallow everything,

395
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:31,517
they're horrifying beings.

396
00:43:42,099 --> 00:43:44,557
What can I do to find her?

397
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,891
We have to capture the
demon to get her back.

398
00:43:47,892 --> 00:43:50,641
Beat it up or negotiate, whatever it takes.

399
00:43:56,849 --> 00:43:59,349
"The child demons are
subconsciously drawn to dolls."

400
00:44:00,141 --> 00:44:02,725
"When they hold the straw dolls
with my blood on them,"

401
00:44:02,767 --> 00:44:05,432
"it'll generate a tingly sensation."

402
00:44:05,474 --> 00:44:07,307
"It's like a trap."

403
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:24,432
This creates a boundary,

404
00:44:25,015 --> 00:44:26,765
these are all money.

405
00:44:26,809 --> 00:44:28,642
Value of these talismans shot up lately!

406
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:34,140
So yeah, these are expensive.

407
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:48,889
Watch carefully, it'll come out soon.

408
00:45:24,058 --> 00:45:25,600
Have you tried this cup noodle?

409
00:45:26,266 --> 00:45:27,598
It feels so genuine.

410
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,517
It has real fried tofu.

411
00:45:31,015 --> 00:45:34,182
Who cares about fried tofu,
does this really work?

412
00:45:34,767 --> 00:45:36,891
Yes, of course.

413
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:38,931
Be patient.

414
00:45:43,016 --> 00:45:45,559
Did it figure us out? Why isn't it coming?

415
00:45:57,559 --> 00:45:59,100
I hear something.

416
00:46:22,182 --> 00:46:24,931
Huh? It's Ina's violin.

417
00:46:48,724 --> 00:46:50,516
My ears...

418
00:47:06,808 --> 00:47:08,516
She's a bold one.

419
00:47:11,016 --> 00:47:12,308
Was Ina here?

420
00:47:14,474 --> 00:47:16,223
Not sure about that.

421
00:47:17,308 --> 00:47:18,349
We'll try once more,

422
00:47:18,683 --> 00:47:20,807
with a big doll drenched in blood.

423
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:26,181
She's really something.

424
00:47:46,641 --> 00:47:47,640
Sir.

425
00:47:48,683 --> 00:47:50,014
Which singers does Ina like?

426
00:47:50,475 --> 00:47:52,350
BTS? BLACKPINK?

427
00:47:52,392 --> 00:47:54,099
Bands that kids nowadays like.

428
00:47:59,808 --> 00:48:04,016
You don't know? Who's her best friend?

429
00:48:08,516 --> 00:48:12,432
You really don't know much about her.

430
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,641
You two don't talk?

431
00:48:18,308 --> 00:48:19,559
That's not right.

432
00:48:20,474 --> 00:48:22,848
I absolutely hate silence.

433
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:25,181
I actually hate being talkative,

434
00:48:26,434 --> 00:48:28,225
but I talk a lot because
I hate silence more.

435
00:48:29,224 --> 00:48:31,807
So, how should I address you?

436
00:48:32,807 --> 00:48:34,140
Whatever you feel like.

437
00:48:34,975 --> 00:48:36,267
Then...

438
00:48:37,474 --> 00:48:39,057
Mr. Yeon?

439
00:48:40,142 --> 00:48:43,559
No, since you retained me how's 'boss'?

440
00:48:45,266 --> 00:48:47,265
I'd rather you call me Mr. Yeon.

441
00:48:47,308 --> 00:48:48,974
What should I call you?

442
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:52,640
General Manager Heo, GMs work the hardest.

443
00:48:55,392 --> 00:48:57,724
I'm thirsty, let me raid your fridge.

444
00:48:58,434 --> 00:48:59,641
I could use a beer.

445
00:49:28,141 --> 00:49:29,099
GM Heo.

446
00:49:29,765 --> 00:49:30,889
GM Heo!

447
00:49:43,349 --> 00:49:44,681
"Dad..."

448
00:49:52,141 --> 00:49:53,682
"Dad!"

449
00:51:09,974 --> 00:51:11,224
"Mr. Yeon, close your eyes."

450
00:51:11,266 --> 00:51:12,390
"Close them now!"

451
00:51:25,392 --> 00:51:28,600
"We didn't set the trap, she did."

452
00:51:29,558 --> 00:51:33,182
The Blinded can only see
those with opened eyes.

453
00:51:33,225 --> 00:51:38,058
So don't open them and get
out of there quietly.

454
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:39,515
Stay still for now.

455
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:41,682
Completely still.

456
00:51:46,434 --> 00:51:49,975
Now, do exactly what I tell you.

457
00:51:52,515 --> 00:51:58,224
"Keep your body low, and
turn right slowly."

458
00:52:25,349 --> 00:52:27,390
No, left from there!

459
00:52:45,515 --> 00:52:46,598
"Mr. Yeon, stop!"

460
00:52:49,682 --> 00:52:50,891
Don't' move.

461
00:52:53,057 --> 00:52:56,266
"Don't move and stay right there."

462
00:53:01,432 --> 00:53:04,140
You're almost there, just hang on.

463
00:53:12,224 --> 00:53:16,974
You're so close, don't move a muscle,

464
00:53:17,016 --> 00:53:19,723
I'll be right there, don't move.

465
00:53:25,975 --> 00:53:27,558
Goddammit...

466
00:53:33,891 --> 00:53:35,057
"Mr. Yeon, get out of there."

467
00:53:36,142 --> 00:53:37,515
"Just come out!"

468
00:54:25,058 --> 00:54:26,640
"All the beings in heaven,"

469
00:54:26,682 --> 00:54:28,474
"and sprouted on earth,"

470
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:34,016
"slay the treacherous and cunning ghouls,"

471
00:54:34,432 --> 00:54:37,224
"repel a 10 million ghosts,
push away all evil,"

472
00:54:37,267 --> 00:54:40,391
"strike down with all your might,"

473
00:54:41,016 --> 00:54:43,557
"and dissipate energy of the vile..."

474
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:47,349
You're...

475
00:54:49,349 --> 00:54:50,515
"Missing Child Cho Myung-jin (11)"

476
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:18,973
Heo!

477
00:55:23,017 --> 00:55:24,225
Heo!

478
00:55:34,059 --> 00:55:36,850
What happened?

479
00:55:39,642 --> 00:55:41,892
That was embarrassing...

480
00:55:54,058 --> 00:55:56,723
- It was Myung-jin...
- Myung-jin?

481
00:56:00,391 --> 00:56:03,266
(In Surgery)

482
00:56:15,017 --> 00:56:19,100
"Missing Child Cho Myung-jin (11)"

483
00:56:33,849 --> 00:56:38,181
(Chungcheong Province,
Jujin District, near Gyunbaek...)

484
00:56:40,059 --> 00:56:42,183
(Gyunbaek Real Estate)

485
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:48,350
I'm not sure, got another photo?

486
00:56:49,058 --> 00:56:50,140
That's all.

487
00:56:53,850 --> 00:56:55,807
He looks like an ex-con.

488
00:56:57,017 --> 00:56:59,516
Did he steal money from you?

489
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:02,016
His child went missing.

490
00:57:02,808 --> 00:57:04,683
Is that so?

491
00:57:04,724 --> 00:57:06,515
Sorry for what I said...

492
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:08,807
Wait, a missing child?

493
00:57:09,683 --> 00:57:12,934
Could it be that Sangdong man?

494
00:57:13,892 --> 00:57:17,557
There's a man who lives alone in Mt.
Sangdon,

495
00:57:18,349 --> 00:57:21,599
he's famous
for all the weird stuff around his house.

496
00:57:21,641 --> 00:57:24,849
"From what I hear, his kid went missing."

497
00:57:49,891 --> 00:57:51,058
"Kyung-hoon..."

498
00:57:51,891 --> 00:57:53,556
"It's mom... mom..."

499
00:57:54,432 --> 00:57:56,349
"Find mom..."

500
00:58:01,516 --> 00:58:03,223
- Defibrillator!
- Yes, doctor!

501
00:58:31,017 --> 00:58:32,140
Hello?

502
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:36,723
Excuse me!

503
00:58:37,724 --> 00:58:39,224
Is anyone home?

504
00:58:45,808 --> 00:58:47,139
Who are you?

505
00:58:53,099 --> 00:58:54,934
Are you Myung-jin's father?

506
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:57,432
Please leave.

507
00:58:58,017 --> 00:58:59,974
I have some questions about her.

508
00:59:04,599 --> 00:59:06,014
Are you a cop?

509
00:59:06,058 --> 00:59:07,140
No, sir.

510
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:26,974
My daughter also disappeared.

511
00:59:27,724 --> 00:59:30,224
I think it's related to Myung-jin somehow.

512
00:59:33,641 --> 00:59:38,932
She disappeared while
sleeping in the next room.

513
00:59:40,391 --> 00:59:44,224
My wife went out to look for her,
and never returned.

514
00:59:46,392 --> 00:59:49,600
I searched her for 10
years before giving up.

515
00:59:52,099 --> 00:59:55,723
And spent another 10 years
trying to forget her.

516
00:59:57,391 --> 01:00:02,306
I don't want to dig up the
past, please leave me.

517
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:07,015
Did anything happen
before her disappearance?

518
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:12,433
This might sound weird,
but did her personality change,

519
01:00:12,475 --> 01:00:15,308
or maybe she talked
to herself in front of the closet?

520
01:00:17,016 --> 01:00:19,558
Why do you think I live up here?

521
01:00:23,225 --> 01:00:26,307
It suffocates me to see kids,

522
01:00:28,767 --> 01:00:32,057
why do you think I live
in complete isolation?

523
01:00:33,391 --> 01:00:34,723
My apologies.

524
01:00:38,973 --> 01:00:44,848
Do you know anything about this doll?

525
01:00:59,057 --> 01:01:01,014
Why is this... But how?!

526
01:01:04,517 --> 01:01:05,684
Why are you here?

527
01:01:06,599 --> 01:01:08,931
Why did you come?!

528
01:01:12,516 --> 01:01:13,848
I'm not gonna die!

529
01:01:13,891 --> 01:01:16,224
You won't get me!

530
01:01:23,432 --> 01:01:25,224
This can't be here.

531
01:01:25,266 --> 01:01:27,767
I have to burn it...

532
01:01:36,642 --> 01:01:37,850
"Dad..."

533
01:01:48,557 --> 01:01:50,724
Myung-jin...

534
01:03:03,724 --> 01:03:04,848
Sir?

535
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:15,349
Hello?

536
01:03:29,559 --> 01:03:30,766
Honey...

537
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:33,600
It's okay...

538
01:03:33,725 --> 01:03:35,140
What are you doing?!

539
01:03:35,516 --> 01:03:36,640
Just hold on...

540
01:03:37,807 --> 01:03:41,057
You go on ahead and wait for us.

541
01:03:41,808 --> 01:03:43,140
Sir, please...

542
01:03:44,683 --> 01:03:45,849
I'll be...

543
01:03:48,516 --> 01:03:50,349
right there...

544
01:03:56,433 --> 01:04:01,141
Dad! Dad! Please let me out!

545
01:04:01,182 --> 01:04:05,266
Dad! I'm really scared!

546
01:04:05,807 --> 01:04:09,722
Mom! Dad!

547
01:04:09,766 --> 01:04:16,517
"Over 1,000 shops have closed down
or are on sale."

548
01:04:16,558 --> 01:04:18,057
"In Seoul alone..."

549
01:04:18,099 --> 01:04:20,307
Please let me out, dad!

550
01:04:20,683 --> 01:04:23,516
Let me out, dad!

551
01:04:27,392 --> 01:04:30,349
Mom! Mom!

552
01:04:31,182 --> 01:04:33,931
Please let me out!

553
01:04:35,183 --> 01:04:39,016
I'm sorry!

554
01:04:40,641 --> 01:04:42,722
Dad!

555
01:04:48,307 --> 01:04:49,558
Myung-jin.

556
01:04:51,517 --> 01:04:55,433
Breathing doesn't prove that we're alive.

557
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:59,183
Dad, please help me...

558
01:05:00,517 --> 01:05:02,849
When we are reborn,

559
01:05:04,932 --> 01:05:08,223
we'll be happy, with no debts.

560
01:05:08,933 --> 01:05:13,224
Dad, I'm really sorry...

561
01:05:15,850 --> 01:05:20,182
Please let me out, I'm sorry...

562
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:23,807
Rather than living like this...

563
01:05:30,682 --> 01:05:33,182
we'll be happier dead.

564
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:37,475
I'm scared, dad...

565
01:05:37,516 --> 01:05:39,598
Please!

566
01:05:40,974 --> 01:05:45,057
Please, I'm sorry!

567
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:46,683
Dad!

568
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:48,350
Dad!

569
01:05:48,933 --> 01:05:50,559
Dad!

570
01:06:33,057 --> 01:06:34,640
Help me...

571
01:07:04,932 --> 01:07:06,224
I saw Myung-jin's memory.

572
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,931
You and Myung-jin's
frequencies must be in sync.

573
01:07:09,933 --> 01:07:11,517
Then you can see each other's memories.

574
01:07:13,391 --> 01:07:16,015
Her resentment turned her into a demon,

575
01:07:16,057 --> 01:07:18,932
and she's been gathering
other kids in pain.

576
01:07:21,141 --> 01:07:22,724
It all makes sense now.

577
01:07:27,765 --> 01:07:29,266
You resented Ina, no?

578
01:07:30,850 --> 01:07:32,266
Be honest for a moment.

579
01:07:32,683 --> 01:07:35,057
Work always meant more than her,

580
01:07:35,099 --> 01:07:36,890
and you wanted her to go away.

581
01:07:37,807 --> 01:07:39,099
Get to your point.

582
01:07:39,765 --> 01:07:42,848
Kids know everything instinctively,

583
01:07:43,725 --> 01:07:46,183
whether someone truly loves them or not.

584
01:07:46,766 --> 01:07:49,558
Buying her some dolls
can't hide your feelings.

585
01:07:51,017 --> 01:07:52,933
All missing kids have something in common.

586
01:07:54,183 --> 01:07:58,433
They're scarred by their parents:

587
01:07:59,142 --> 01:08:01,017
assault, verbal abuse, and abandonment.

588
01:08:02,017 --> 01:08:03,641
Same thing with Ina.

589
01:08:04,309 --> 01:08:07,016
How painful would it have
been to live with a dad

590
01:08:08,016 --> 01:08:09,681
who wanted her gone.

591
01:08:11,308 --> 01:08:12,891
Imagine her loneliness.

592
01:08:17,017 --> 01:08:21,225
Her sorrow called for Myung-jin.

593
01:08:25,683 --> 01:08:27,808
So it was me who sent her away.

594
01:08:58,975 --> 01:09:00,850
- Mr. Heo.
- Holy craps...

595
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:03,017
What is it?

596
01:09:04,433 --> 01:09:05,807
About that frequency,

597
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:10,724
so you're saying if we're in sync,

598
01:09:11,432 --> 01:09:12,724
I can see and enter their realm?

599
01:09:13,099 --> 01:09:14,806
Right, if you're in sync.

600
01:09:15,724 --> 01:09:20,224
When I had that panic attack,
you said I was in sync with Myung-jin.

601
01:09:20,807 --> 01:09:23,182
Does that mean I can meet Ina?

602
01:09:24,724 --> 01:09:26,016
What do you want to do?

603
01:09:26,558 --> 01:09:29,391
We're running out of time,
let me enter their realm.

604
01:09:31,350 --> 01:09:35,766
No way, it's too dangerous,
you'll get hurt.

605
01:09:39,057 --> 01:09:41,348
I don't care if it's too dangerous,

606
01:09:42,266 --> 01:09:45,057
there's no other way,
unless you got a plan.

607
01:09:48,224 --> 01:09:49,348
Help me get there.

608
01:09:50,515 --> 01:09:52,099
You have no idea what you're saying.

609
01:09:52,641 --> 01:09:55,266
Once you're there, you
could get stuck and die.

610
01:09:55,308 --> 01:09:57,432
Plus, you'll ruin my exorcism career.

611
01:09:57,475 --> 01:09:59,683
You're asking the impossible,
it's just not doable.

612
01:10:05,267 --> 01:10:10,142
Sorry for bringing up money,
but I'll pay you whatever you want.

613
01:10:12,891 --> 01:10:15,766
So help me get there.

614
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:19,182
I want to see her, please help me.

615
01:10:23,224 --> 01:10:24,931
Jesus...

616
01:10:26,349 --> 01:10:28,558
I'll protect you with a ritual,

617
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:30,892
but you'll have no longer than 30 minutes.

618
01:10:30,933 --> 01:10:33,725
If you don't come out before then,
remember the Blinded?

619
01:10:35,308 --> 01:10:37,432
You'll turn into that and
stay in the underworld.

620
01:10:37,475 --> 01:10:39,309
It's okay, let's try it.

621
01:10:40,599 --> 01:10:42,224
All right, let's try it.

622
01:10:43,390 --> 01:10:45,681
"How to worsen your panic attack?"

623
01:10:46,184 --> 01:10:47,391
"That's a weird question."

624
01:10:47,432 --> 01:10:50,806
Could you just trust me? Please.

625
01:11:09,766 --> 01:11:12,557
"Cho Myung-jin (11)"

626
01:11:24,516 --> 01:11:26,725
"If there's a high intake
of caffeine pills,"

627
01:11:26,766 --> 01:11:29,765
"you'll get a panic attack,
and at worse, death,"

628
01:11:30,475 --> 01:11:32,224
"so be absolutely careful."

629
01:11:33,224 --> 01:11:34,973
"Remember that I've warned you."

630
01:11:58,974 --> 01:12:00,141
Are you ready?

631
01:12:01,515 --> 01:12:03,058
My symptom will start soon.

632
01:12:03,432 --> 01:12:06,765
Myung-jin created that realm,
so anything can happen,

633
01:12:06,808 --> 01:12:09,515
she'll do whatever it takes to stop you,

634
01:12:09,557 --> 01:12:10,973
so be prepared.

635
01:12:11,017 --> 01:12:14,558
I'm bringing my daughter back.

636
01:12:17,642 --> 01:12:19,099
Stay alive...

637
01:12:21,641 --> 01:12:23,306
and pay me for my service, got it?

638
01:12:25,557 --> 01:12:26,724
Depends on your performance.

639
01:12:57,266 --> 01:12:59,016
This fire is linked to you.

640
01:12:59,974 --> 01:13:02,057
If the time runs out, or if you die,

641
01:13:02,641 --> 01:13:04,265
this fire will go out.

642
01:16:39,016 --> 01:16:40,140
Seung-hee...

643
01:16:47,349 --> 01:16:48,891
Wait, honey!

644
01:16:54,432 --> 01:16:55,641
Seung-hee...

645
01:17:05,474 --> 01:17:07,431
Look what you've done to Ina.

646
01:17:08,099 --> 01:17:10,431
Ina is dying.

647
01:17:10,474 --> 01:17:11,641
Die!

648
01:19:21,099 --> 01:19:22,139
Ina!

649
01:20:08,850 --> 01:20:09,849
Ina!

650
01:20:23,641 --> 01:20:24,640
Ina!

651
01:20:41,474 --> 01:20:42,598
Seung-hee...

652
01:20:43,432 --> 01:20:44,515
Honey, are you okay?

653
01:20:45,099 --> 01:20:46,140
Baby...

654
01:20:47,142 --> 01:20:48,224
Ina...

655
01:20:49,182 --> 01:20:49,931
Ina?

656
01:20:49,974 --> 01:20:53,765
Protect her no matter what, okay?

657
01:20:56,975 --> 01:20:58,974
Seung-hee! Honey!

658
01:21:00,225 --> 01:21:01,392
Sweetheart...

659
01:21:02,182 --> 01:21:04,515
No! Seung-hee!

660
01:21:13,599 --> 01:21:14,598
Ina...

661
01:21:16,558 --> 01:21:17,807
Ina!

662
01:21:18,724 --> 01:21:20,350
Why are you here?

663
01:21:29,475 --> 01:21:33,391
Myung-jin, I came to get Ina.

664
01:21:33,891 --> 01:21:36,724
Why? This is what you wanted.

665
01:21:37,765 --> 01:21:39,764
You wanted to throw her away.

666
01:21:43,766 --> 01:21:47,099
That donation to the art camp,
how much would be enough?

667
01:21:48,099 --> 01:21:51,890
Back then, I...

668
01:21:51,933 --> 01:21:54,392
Ina will soon live with us here.

669
01:22:00,933 --> 01:22:01,974
Myung-jin!

670
01:22:02,183 --> 01:22:03,350
Please let her go...

671
01:22:04,015 --> 01:22:05,849
Please let me take her back.

672
01:22:19,682 --> 01:22:20,723
Myung-jin,

673
01:22:21,475 --> 01:22:23,474
what happened to you that day...

674
01:22:24,890 --> 01:22:26,265
I saw it all.

675
01:22:27,141 --> 01:22:32,806
That's why you brought
other kids here, Ina too.

676
01:22:34,183 --> 01:22:38,807
The last thing you heard that day...

677
01:22:38,849 --> 01:22:40,016
I don't want to hear it!

678
01:22:40,683 --> 01:22:42,682
Rather than living like this...

679
01:22:43,391 --> 01:22:45,932
We'll be happier dead.

680
01:22:47,016 --> 01:22:48,348
Do you trust me?

681
01:22:58,057 --> 01:22:59,181
Mom!

682
01:23:03,058 --> 01:23:04,350
Mom...

683
01:23:08,267 --> 01:23:10,142
I want to live...

684
01:23:13,349 --> 01:23:15,266
It's all grown-ups' fault.

685
01:23:16,266 --> 01:23:17,723
It's my fault.

686
01:23:22,891 --> 01:23:24,100
It's all my fault...

687
01:23:24,433 --> 01:23:25,932
Don't lie to me!

688
01:23:34,765 --> 01:23:35,682
It's mom...

689
01:23:36,267 --> 01:23:38,434
"Don't forget, find mom!"

690
01:23:38,932 --> 01:23:40,265
Mom...

691
01:23:55,017 --> 01:23:57,225
Ina, honey!

692
01:24:01,933 --> 01:24:02,932
Kill him.

693
01:24:10,309 --> 01:24:12,475
Ina, please snap out of it.

694
01:24:15,724 --> 01:24:17,432
Everything belongs somewhere,

695
01:24:17,765 --> 01:24:20,682
you will find out where god is.

696
01:24:28,057 --> 01:24:29,723
Ina, please...

697
01:24:41,807 --> 01:24:42,682
Ina!

698
01:24:43,558 --> 01:24:44,640
"Myung-jin?"

699
01:25:09,016 --> 01:25:10,932
Here you were, my baby.

700
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:14,182
Mom?

701
01:25:14,766 --> 01:25:17,017
How scared must you have been?

702
01:25:22,391 --> 01:25:24,308
How painful...

703
01:25:29,142 --> 01:25:31,267
I should've protected you...

704
01:25:32,432 --> 01:25:34,682
I'm so sorry, sweetheart...

705
01:25:38,808 --> 01:25:43,350
I only waited for you.

706
01:25:43,392 --> 01:25:46,141
- Mom...
- Myung-jin.

707
01:25:51,558 --> 01:25:53,849
You can rest with me now.

708
01:25:59,641 --> 01:26:00,682
Ina.

709
01:26:02,016 --> 01:26:03,473
Ina...

710
01:26:09,599 --> 01:26:10,681
Myung-jin...

711
01:26:13,765 --> 01:26:14,890
Mom!

712
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,892
Mom...

713
01:26:20,891 --> 01:26:22,223
Mom!

714
01:26:32,225 --> 01:26:33,433
Mom!

715
01:26:39,683 --> 01:26:40,975
Mom...

716
01:26:42,267 --> 01:26:46,557
Mom! Mom!

717
01:26:49,017 --> 01:26:52,767
Mom! Mom!

718
01:26:52,933 --> 01:26:57,349
Mom! Mom!

719
01:26:57,390 --> 01:26:59,640
Mom!

720
01:27:03,183 --> 01:27:04,348
Myung-jin.

721
01:27:17,391 --> 01:27:21,308
Mr. Yeon, hurry, there's no time.

722
01:27:38,225 --> 01:27:39,391
Myung-jin.

723
01:27:45,975 --> 01:27:47,307
I'm really sorry.

724
01:27:54,974 --> 01:27:56,389
I'm so sorry.

725
01:29:22,475 --> 01:29:23,683
Ina!

726
01:29:35,349 --> 01:29:36,599
Ina, wake up...

727
01:29:38,933 --> 01:29:40,264
Ina...

728
01:29:57,557 --> 01:29:58,807
Dad...

729
01:30:00,724 --> 01:30:03,223
Dad, I want to go home.

730
01:30:05,307 --> 01:30:07,973
Ina, let's go home, we'll be right there.

731
01:30:08,933 --> 01:30:10,099
Let's go home.

732
01:30:58,974 --> 01:30:59,973
Mr. Yeon!

733
01:32:25,390 --> 01:32:27,307
She still doesn't remember the underworld?

734
01:32:27,349 --> 01:32:29,056
I hope she doesn't ever remember it.

735
01:32:31,433 --> 01:32:32,683
How's the new house?

736
01:32:33,974 --> 01:32:36,389
It's good enough for us, very cozy.

737
01:32:37,516 --> 01:32:38,474
That's great.

738
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:45,765
If you want to use a credit card,
there's a 10% surcharge.

739
01:32:47,433 --> 01:32:50,016
If you blog about me,
I'll give you free talismans.

740
01:32:54,892 --> 01:32:57,058
(Total: $205,000)

741
01:33:03,432 --> 01:33:04,515
Ina!

742
01:33:06,474 --> 01:33:07,890
Hi, dad!

743
01:33:07,934 --> 01:33:09,725
Hop in, little miss!

744
01:33:13,016 --> 01:33:15,141
It's okay, baby, he's a good man.

745
01:33:17,474 --> 01:33:19,057
You'll have to revise this.

746
01:33:19,517 --> 01:33:20,809
I'll just ignore it.
