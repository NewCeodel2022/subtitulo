00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,418
NETFLIX PRESENTS

2
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:28,672
Mother.

3
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,587
WE WERE IN A HURRY. THERE'S NO FOOD.

4
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,130
GO TO THE STORE WITH YOUR SISTER.

5
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,590
SORRY, SON. LOVE, MOM.

6
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:24,895
Hello.

7
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,104
Hello.

8
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,565
Morris joined. Brilliant.

9
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:29,524
Hello!

10
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,109
Shall we attack the school today?

11
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,653
No.

12
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,447
First we will stock up in the bunker.

13
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,532
Then we will go to the place that I will mark for you.

14
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,243
- Sounds good. - That? What's that?

15
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,662
- That? - That's crazy. Oh really?

16
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,914
- Watch the TV. - It must be by computer.

17
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,874
- What's up? - It's like a movie.

18
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:58,428
Ultrafine dust levels reached their peak today...

19
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:04,476
EMERGENCY ALERT

20
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,478
As you can see, some civilians

21
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:10,982
they have become incredibly violent and assault passersby.

22
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:15,362
This phenomenon, which started with riots in the Gangbuk district,

23
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,489
it is spreading rapidly.

24
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:21,284
It seems like not just in Seoul, but nationwide.

25
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:25,997
The government is now considering raising the emergency level to serious...

26
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,683
Aid!

27
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,808
SEOUL FIREFIGHTERS

28
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,366
Help me! Fast!

29
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,000
Mother.

30
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,294
Mom, where are you?

31
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:55,295
Mother!

32
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,448
Runs!

33
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,093
¡Aléjense!

34
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:13,832
Wait...

35
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,375
Oh my God!

36
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:16,501
Who are you?

37
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:17,711
I'm sorry.

38
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,045
I'm truly sorry.

39
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:22,132
You know who I am, don't you? We know each other.

40
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,717
I live next door. Unit 403.

41
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,720
I don't mind. Go away.

42
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,764
No!

43
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,934
Give me a minute. Listen to me.

44
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,230
Something is not right.

45
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,734
Outside the people are...

46
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,072
You are alone, aren't you?

47
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:48,283
Yeah.

48
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,703
Just in my apartment

49
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,164
my brother suddenly...

50
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:55,999
My brother...

51
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:07,052
Look, I don't know what's going on.

52
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,931
But what happened there doesn't interest me.

53
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:14,142
- If there's a problem, call the police. - Wait.

54
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,728
You do not know? Didn't you see what's going on outside?

55
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,271
Do you really know nothing?

56
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,608
- The police and the people... - Go away! Out!

57
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,068
Hang on a minute.

58
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,319
Wait. So...

59
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,030
just let me use your bathroom.

60
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,829
Good, but go later.

61
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:36,790
Thank you.

62
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:46,633
Sorry for the interruption. The network connection is unstable.

63
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,259
I repeat.

64
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:51,513
Due to the rapid spread of infection in highly populated areas,

65
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:55,266
the situation in the main cities has become uncontrollable.

66
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,728
The infected have been known to suddenly turn violent,

67
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:03,358
and the main symptoms of the infection include screaming and bleeding eyes.

68
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,568
Last News.

69
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:10,323
They denounce cannibal behavior among those infected.

70
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,242
I repeat.

71
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,704
Cannibalistic tendencies among the infected are rampant.

72
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,581
They not only attack innocent civilians,

73
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,793
they also display cannibalistic behavior.

74
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,754
The KCDC stated that the bite of an infected...

75
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,007
I mean, a bite or wound...

76
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,303
Wait! Stop! Hey! Careful!

77
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:33,221
Look.

78
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,056
I'm fine.

79
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,517
Look, I'm...

80
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,645
I'm perfect! No Please...

81
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,522
Don't kick me out, okay?

82
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,817
You said you'd leave when you're done.

83
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,737
- Go away. - Then in an hour.

84
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,531
I'll just stay an hour, please.

85
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,617
Hey, what happened to your hand?

86
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,079
It's no big deal.

87
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,581
It's no big deal.

88
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,207
I did not go.

89
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,208
No!

90
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,210
No!

91
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,129
No!

92
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,803
It just can't be! No!

93
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,354
Hey, I told you to go away!

94
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,482
Go away!

95
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,578
I said out!

96
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,311
YOUR CREDIT OF 421,500 WON EXPIRES ON 11/24

97
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,027
There is an unusual...

98
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:07,161
We can't connect you to voicemail right now.

99
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,581
FOUR UNREADED MESSAGES FROM MOM

100
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:13,710
JUN-U, ARE YOU OKAY? WE'RE GOING. DO NOT OPEN TO ANYONE.

101
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,921
WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ARRIVE, BUT WE ARE FINE. DON'T WORRY.

102
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,548
DO WHAT THEY SAY ON TV.

103
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,383
MY SON! YOU MUST SURVIVE!

104
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,860
I MUST SURVIVE

105
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,209
Heavens, mom.

106
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,880
I should have gone to the store, like you said.

107
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:21,069
We hear different opinions on the situation.

108
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:23,613
DAY 2

109
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:28,159
Professor and infectious disease specialist Kim Yeon-jeong is in the study.

110
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:31,329
Professor Kim, how would you define your situation?

111
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,457
In addition to his physical and behavioral changes,

112
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,292
we are not sure of anything.

113
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:40,129
However, it appears that extreme aggressive tendencies

114
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:44,217
and cannibalistic acts are more related to the brain.

115
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,220
Could it be some kind of mental illness

116
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:50,264
and not an infectious disease?

117
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:51,808
We can't connect it...

118
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,561
The most probable cause was the mutation of a virus.

119
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:59,357
However, aggressive and cannibalistic tendencies

120
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,778
that appear after becoming infected appear to be connected to the brain.

121
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,739
The mutated virus affects you directly,

122
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:12,161
especially to the right hemisphere, which triggers violent behavior.

123
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:23,297
EUNSOL COMPLEX 201, UNIT 402 79-3 YANGUI-RO, YEONGDEUNGPO, SEOUL

124
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:26,801
THERE IS A SURVIVOR. SEND HELP.

125
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,726
#I MUST_SURVIVE

126
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:41,941
Hey, it works.

127
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,443
You see? What did I tell you?

128
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,194
Guys, look!

129
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,321
It works!

130
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,407
- Hey, can you hear me? - Hello?

131
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,325
Hey, it's me. Here I am.

132
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:53,995
- I can't hear you. - It really works. Brilliant!

133
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,080
- Oh my God. - Hello?

134
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:57,457
- That? - Hello?

135
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,041
There!

136
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:01,961
No!

137
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,339
A viewer sent us this video.

138
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:11,053
As you can see, the infected show physical changes

139
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,389
and extreme violent tendencies.

140
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:16,559
Symptoms do not appear right away.

141
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:20,146
Those infected can be asymptomatic for several minutes.

142
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:55,389
NO SERVICE

143
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,953
CALLING DAD

144
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,621
Good heavens.

145
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,456
That?

146
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,293
No.

147
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:26,837
Heavens.

148
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,430

150
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,304
Hey!

151
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,515
Here!

152
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:43,808
To you!

153
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,476
Hey!

154
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:48,562
Damn!

155
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:55,624
Hi, I'm Oh Jun-u.

156
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:01,380
My subscribers probably know me as Morris62.

157
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,094
Well.

158
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,265
I...

159
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,562
I've been stuck in my house for two days.

160
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:23,694
"You must survive.

161
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:26,739
You must survive!"

162
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:34,288
That was the last message I received from my dad.

163
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,169
The problem

164
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:44,089
I really don't know how I'm going to do it.

165
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:50,387
It's a miracle he's still alive and recording this right now.

166
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:51,513
Heavens...

167
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,144
Well anyway...

168
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,103
Very good.

169
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:01,315

00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,373
Forgive me, dad.

172
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:28,801
I MUST SURVIVE

173
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:32,846
So far it is known that the infection only spreads

174
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:36,433
by the transfer of blood through bites and wounds.

175
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:41,105
Therefore, the best we can do is prevent the infected from biting us.

176
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:44,692
Except for cannibalistic and violent tendencies,

177
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:46,902
the infected do not appear to possess

178
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:50,322
a heightened sense of vision, hearing, or smell.

179
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:53,409
Some seem to retain certain patterns of behavior

180
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:57,246
prior to contagion, such as opening doors or windows.

181
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,708
Some remember their work and repeat behaviors over and over again.

182
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:03,293
A wide variety of cases were reported.

183
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:07,256
- Available to everyone. - Idiots. A commercial now?

184
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:20,894
Make it better with Jin Ramen.

185
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:23,397
Ottogi Jin Ramen.

186
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,943
LAST SUPPER

187
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,577
Today we would like to show you

188
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:41,081
emergency response measures to help them through this crisis.

189
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:42,750
let's welcome you

190
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:44,752
to the psychologist Kim Elena.

191
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:45,669
Dr. Kim?

192
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:50,424
I would like to teach you a breathing exercise to reduce anxiety.

193
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:55,763
LAST SUPPER

194
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:46,647
DAY 10

195
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,576
It's me again, Oh Jun-u.

196
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,124
I have almost run out of water and food.

197
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:10,629
But I won't leave my house, ever.

198
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,715
I'd rather starve than get bitten

199
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:16,051
and end up like those monsters.

200
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:19,972
They continue with the same image on TV every day.

201
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,391
They repeat that we should wait at home,

202
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,643
but I don't know what's going on.

203
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:28,814
My mom hardly ever watches TV.

204
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,775
He likes to listen to the radio while he cleans.

205
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:35,362
He has even submitted his stories to some programs.

206
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,324
Radio.

207
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,994
Due to frequent emergencies,

208
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:47,541
created an app that uses FM frequency to send emergency broadcasts.

209
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,840
You can plug in a 3.5mm audio jack as an antenna

210
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,175
to receive signals.

211
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,887
A headphone jack would be ideal.

212
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,263
Shit.

213
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:07,811
Curse. Why all wireless?

214
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:21,074
DAY 15

215
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:07,329
He's probably in his room playing again.

216
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,374
Next time, let's go on a trip with the whole family.

217
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,541
Alright.

218
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,923
Hello, why are you just standing there?

219
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:19,508
Hello, crybaby.

220
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:22,302
Can't say hello?

221
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,389
Son, have you eaten yet?

222
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,939
Mother.

223
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:45,617
Mother.

224
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:24,758
That?

225
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,931
NEW VOICE MESSAGE

226
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,604
Son.

227
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:39,689
Stay home, okay?

228
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:40,774
Do not go out.

229
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:03,922
Jun-u.

230
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:06,133
Now we are in dad's office

231
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:07,217
with your sister.

232
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,095
How is Jun-u? Is he okay? He's home, right?

233
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,596
- My God! - What's happening?

234
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,682
Mom run! Now!

235
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:14,808
That? Dear!

236
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,143
- Shut up! - Go away!

237
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:18,145
Come here right now!

238
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:20,647
Hide by the window! Jun-hui!

239
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,150
- They'll get you! Go away! - No!

240
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:26,653
Honey, don't let go of my hand!

241
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:27,863
Dear!

242
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,156
What do we do?

243
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:30,866
¡ Jun-hui!

244
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,284
Aid!

245
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,035
Help us!

246
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,187
Shit!

247
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:03,231
Damn sons of bitches!

248
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:05,400
come out!

249
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,154
come out!

250
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:12,157
Get out now!

251
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:17,621
Curse.

252
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:45,815
That?

253
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:48,902
What the fuck do you want?

254
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,696
Aid!

255
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:54,032
Please!

256
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,617
Please help!

257
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:35,819
DAY 20

258
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:48,767
Hello.

259
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:57,984
Bye bye.

260
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,114
¿"Idio...

261
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,117
ta"?

262
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:31,786
Moron?

263
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:40,628
Yes, you idiot.

264
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:03,109
That?

265
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:19,709
Five.

266
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:20,835
Two.

267
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:26,174
At seven.

268
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:28,343
At seven?

269
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,427
Yeah.

270
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,215
DAY 3, DAY 4, DAY 5, DAY 6, DAY 7

271
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,413
Sorry.

272
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,211
Wait.

273
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,636
OH JUN-U

274
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,610
KIM YU-BIN

275
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:34,904
Kim Yu-bin.

276
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:39,534
Kim Yu-bin.

277
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:44,372
Mrs. Kim Yu-bin.

278
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:46,082
Yu-bin?

279
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:55,007
Could it be that he really is an idiot?

280
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,844
Damn, you're a loser.

281
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:04,851
No.

282
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:07,895
What are you doing?

283
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:19,866
No wait. Do not go.

284
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,093
Yes, at seven.

285
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:54,335
Eighth floor.

286
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:00,174
Eighth floor.

287
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:41,966
I'm not well.

288
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:47,138
Are you hungry?

289
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:49,807
Yeah.

290
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:34,078
EAT SLOWLY!

291
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:41,168
You shouldn't eat so fast.

292
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:44,857
EMERGENCY SERVICE 911

293
00:50:46,252 --> 00:50:47,545
Ok, here I go.

294
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:56,136
No.

295
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:14,923
RESIST!

296
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:27,936
Oh my God...

297
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:31,023
How will I survive on this alone?

298
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:35,611
I MUST SURVIVE

299
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:38,697
Oh Jun-u, you can.

300
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:41,742
Oh Jun-u, you can.

301
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:49,833
Let's stock up.

302
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:33,752
My God.

303
00:57:02,044 --> 00:57:03,253
Let go of me, damn!

304
00:57:03,337 --> 00:57:04,171
¡Sueltame!

305
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:56,765
Curse.

306
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:23,834
Hello?

307
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,254
Hello? Anyone there?

308
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:28,588
Shit.

309
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:29,631
My God.

310
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:30,799
Hello?

311
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:32,884
Are you still sleeping?

312
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:35,554
Can you hear me? Hello?

313
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:37,973
Yes, I can hear you.

314
00:58:39,433 --> 00:58:40,517
Hello.

315
00:58:40,976 --> 00:58:41,810
Yes, hello!

316
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:44,104
Slowly lower your voice.

317
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:47,107
Alright. Yeah.

318
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:49,818
The thing is...

319
00:58:50,277 --> 00:58:51,528
i'm so excited.

320
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:52,738
This is incredible!

321
00:58:52,821 --> 00:58:55,032
You don't need to whisper either.

322
00:58:55,741 --> 00:58:56,700
Yes of course.

323
00:58:57,993 --> 00:58:58,910
That bag.

324
00:58:58,994 --> 00:58:59,828
That?

325
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:00,871
The...

326
00:59:00,996 --> 00:59:02,039
Nutella.

327
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:03,290
Can you hear me?

328
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:04,750
Nutella.

329
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:07,210
Hello?

330
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:08,378
Hello?

331
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:12,007
- Don't press the button while I'm talking. - That?

332
00:59:13,425 --> 00:59:14,426
The walkie-talkie.

333
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:17,721
Don't push the button when I'm talking.

334
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,517
Yes I know. I'm not an idiot.

335
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:25,145
Thanks for the food.

336
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:27,481
You are welcome.

337
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:30,567
Well, do you like Nutella?

338
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:38,658
Not bad.

339
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:41,578
That? Well, why did I give it to him?

340
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:44,831
I heard you.

341
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:47,375
God, what an idiot.

342
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,712
I still hear you

343
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:59,054
Thanks, it was delicious.

344
00:59:59,638 --> 01:00:00,889
I enjoyed it.

345
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:05,560
I should thank you.

346
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:06,937
for saving me

347
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:09,147
Thank you so much.

348
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:14,903
I didn't save you.

349
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:17,030
As?

350
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:18,907
I said I didn't save you.

351
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:22,494
You saved yourself because you wanted to live.

352
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:29,292
you wanted to live That's what keeps you alive.

353
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:31,795
No, but still...

354
01:00:32,921 --> 01:00:34,131
Without you...

355
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:37,259
If I hadn't met you

356
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:40,345
I wouldn't be here now.

357
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:42,639
Almost dead.

358
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:45,642
No, actually, I was going to take my own life.

359
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:48,520
I'm sorry,

360
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,565
we can change the subject?

361
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:53,191
That?

362
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,028
If you do not mind,

363
01:00:58,947 --> 01:01:01,616
talk about something else. It does not matter that.

364
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:07,622
Do you want Chapagetti?

365
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:12,502
Did you pour the water?

366
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:16,047
Just a little to start.

367
01:01:16,131 --> 01:01:19,885
Control the amount of water and heat it until it boils.

368
01:01:19,968 --> 01:01:22,846
- Until it boils? - If you mix them with rice.

369
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:24,598
Who eats Chapagetti like that?

370
01:01:25,849 --> 01:01:27,726
Do you know how to cook instant pasta?

371
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:30,353
Who does not?

372
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,356
Your course.

373
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:36,651
Why don't you pour the water? It's strange.

374
01:01:42,282 --> 01:01:45,660
The Chapagetti are much better mixed with Neoguri.

375
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:47,495
Especially, chapaguri.

376
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:50,040
NEOGURI

377
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:55,337
That's too much food for me.

378
01:01:55,879 --> 01:01:57,422
Can't you finish that?

379
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:01,301
Come.

380
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:03,595
Yes, I will do it.

381
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:07,682
Awesome.

382
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:11,353
I wish I could top it off with sesame oil.

383
01:02:19,778 --> 01:02:21,029
Are you afraid of heights?

384
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:23,657
That? What's wrong with it?

385
01:02:24,616 --> 01:02:27,285
Well, it's not for you.

386
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:32,249
You chopped off someone's hand with an axe, and you're afraid of heights?

387
01:02:36,336 --> 01:02:38,797
- I never cut anyone's hand off. - That?

388
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,757
These monsters are not human.

389
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:42,676
They are no longer.

390
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:47,681
I'm afraid of heights.

391
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,517
I fell climbing a few years ago.

392
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:52,811
climbing?

393
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:57,065
I mean, climbing a cliff with no equipment, right?

394
01:02:57,649 --> 01:02:59,401
Like Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible!

395
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:01,987
Well, I'm not that good.

396
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:09,035
Tom Cruise? You sound like an old man.

397
01:03:10,537 --> 01:03:13,999
It's raining! Pick up some water. Take a bowl. No, a bucket!

398
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:15,583
A bucket?

399
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:27,762
It doesn't sound like rain.

400
01:04:03,048 --> 01:04:04,382
Jun-u.

401
01:04:04,466 --> 01:04:05,550
Jun-u.

402
01:04:25,779 --> 01:04:27,238
Yu bin, are you alright?

403
01:04:29,741 --> 01:04:31,409
They are coming here.

404
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:44,089
They are in front of my door.

405
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,225
They are already out there.

406
01:04:58,895 --> 01:04:59,771
What unit?

407
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:02,065
- That? - Your unit number.

408
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:40,353
Are you ready?

409
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:42,981
By the way,

410
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:45,984
Are you sure there's no one there?

411
01:05:49,863 --> 01:05:50,822
Yes, sure.

412
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:53,450
The eighth floor is the only empty one.

413
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:56,578
Yu-bin. Even if it wasn't...

414
01:05:59,122 --> 01:06:01,166
It's okay even if it wasn't.

415
01:06:01,249 --> 01:06:04,335
We will end up dead because they will eat us or because of hunger.

416
01:06:07,422 --> 01:06:08,339
It doesn't matter.

417
01:06:08,756 --> 01:06:09,632
That?

418
01:06:10,175 --> 01:06:12,343
I'm coming. I'm leaving.

419
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:23,396
But not through the door.

420
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:41,206
What are you doing?

421
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:46,544
You-were.

422
01:06:46,628 --> 01:06:47,795
Can you hear me?

423
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:52,175
Do you think we can survive?

424
01:06:59,641 --> 01:07:00,683
I'm not sure.

425
01:07:05,522 --> 01:07:06,898
But I want.

426
01:07:10,068 --> 01:07:12,153
I really want to live too.

427
01:07:14,822 --> 01:07:17,909
I don't want to be eaten to pieces by those things.

428
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:21,746
And I would hate to be eaten alive.

429
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:26,668
So we must survive.

430
01:07:27,544 --> 01:07:28,878
We will survive together.

431
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:32,757
Alright then.

432
01:07:35,093 --> 01:07:36,553
Hey, Yubin. Listen to me.

433
01:07:38,096 --> 01:07:41,057
I'll go down first and distract them. That is your moment.

434
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:43,685
One,

435
01:07:44,227 --> 01:07:45,061
two.

436
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:46,187
Then...

437
01:07:46,938 --> 01:07:47,814
Three!

438
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:01,202
Then you can go down.

439
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:05,707
Who is it?

440
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:25,602
Incredible.

441
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:03,431
Yu-bin!

442
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:05,433
Come on!

443
01:09:57,318 --> 01:09:58,778
I see you're still alive.

444
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:00,405
Pleased to meet you.

445
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:01,698
Likewise.

446
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:05,993
You sound so casual.

447
01:10:07,495 --> 01:10:08,329
You too.

448
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:11,791
God, I'm exhausted.

449
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:14,127
Eighth floor.

450
01:11:36,584 --> 01:11:37,835
Please!

451
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:49,305
Here!

452
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:51,432
Come on! Hurry up!

453
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:15,206
Alright.

454
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:16,457
We're ok.

455
01:12:16,541 --> 01:12:17,667
We're good now.

456
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:19,544
By God, they scared me.

457
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:25,508
Guys.

458
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:29,053
You shouldn't thank me

459
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:30,471
but that thing...

460
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,390
Can you ask her to leave her?

461
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:35,393
You-were.

462
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:38,729
Who are you? Why did you help us?

463
01:12:39,814 --> 01:12:40,731
Well,

464
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:43,943
Weren't you the ones asking for help?

465
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:49,240
The eighth was empty.

466
01:12:57,582 --> 01:12:58,666
My God.

467
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:00,209
By the way,

468
01:13:00,877 --> 01:13:02,712
how did they survive?

469
01:13:03,963 --> 01:13:06,674
My gosh, I'm impressed.

470
01:13:07,425 --> 01:13:11,095
I thought I was the only survivor in the building.

471
01:13:12,638 --> 01:13:13,848
we also thought

472
01:13:13,931 --> 01:13:17,935
that we were the only survivors and that the rest had ended up like this.

473
01:13:18,019 --> 01:13:19,395
Sure, of course.

474
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:22,940
But not anymore, right?

475
01:13:23,024 --> 01:13:25,735
Sure, now we are three.

476
01:13:26,611 --> 01:13:28,738
You seem to know a lot.

477
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:31,365
I mean, about them.

478
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:33,618
Yes, because I'm still alive.

479
01:13:34,201 --> 01:13:36,621
I was stuck listening to the news.

480
01:13:36,704 --> 01:13:37,914
The same here.

481
01:13:38,539 --> 01:13:40,333
But why are they together?

482
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:41,334
They know each other?

483
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:45,338
Not so much. We didn't know each other before. We met four days ago.

484
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:46,672
I see.

485
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:49,216
Have you been sheltering here alone?

486
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:50,384
Yes I think so.

487
01:13:51,886 --> 01:13:52,720
Anyway...

488
01:13:55,473 --> 01:13:57,600
Aren't you thirsty? Drink a little.

489
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:00,519
What's happening?

490
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:03,022
Good. I know.

491
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:09,111
With everything that's going on, I'm not surprised they're on their toes.

492
01:14:21,332 --> 01:14:22,583
Just drink. Alright.

493
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:30,675
They must be hungry. Do you want to eat something? Yeah?

494
01:14:34,845 --> 01:14:35,972
I will eat Spam.

495
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:45,481
AND? They like?

496
01:14:46,065 --> 01:14:48,150
Yes. This is amazing.

497
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:50,444
I'm glad to hear it.

498
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:54,949
Eat slower.

499
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:56,909
Good thank you.

500
01:14:57,994 --> 01:15:01,205
There is food until rescue arrives. Eat slowly.

501
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:03,374
The rescue?

502
01:15:03,457 --> 01:15:05,001
- Oh really? - Rescue?

503
01:15:06,669 --> 01:15:08,045
Didn't you hear the news?

504
01:15:08,546 --> 01:15:10,548
Isn't that why you came here?

505
01:15:11,966 --> 01:15:13,634
Did you hear it on the news?

506
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:16,178
From time to time I have a signal.

507
01:15:17,555 --> 01:15:19,390
Did you seriously not hear it?

508
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:33,612
We did it.

509
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:39,869
Yeah, we just have to stay here and hold on a little longer.

510
01:15:41,912 --> 01:15:42,997
My God.

511
01:15:49,462 --> 01:15:52,048
And how did he manage to hide all this time?

512
01:15:55,885 --> 01:15:57,511
It's easy when you're older.

513
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:02,725
I would hide when I wanted to smoke for my wife. That helped.

514
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:18,824
Do you have boys?

515
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:23,454
No.

516
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:26,665
But today two boys came.

517
01:16:28,793 --> 01:16:29,794
Excuse me?

518
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:42,515
Mister.

519
01:16:52,733 --> 01:16:53,609
Mister...

520
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:54,568
Mister.

521
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:57,446
Hey, Jun-u.

522
01:16:58,322 --> 01:16:59,365
Jun-u.

523
01:17:16,715 --> 01:17:18,259
Just go to sleep.

524
01:17:20,761 --> 01:17:22,888
Fine, like that.

525
01:17:25,683 --> 01:17:26,767
Jun-u.

526
01:17:26,851 --> 01:17:29,603
Jun-u.

527
01:19:23,467 --> 01:19:24,760
My wife...

528
01:19:26,387 --> 01:19:27,721
He hasn't eaten for days.

529
01:19:29,723 --> 01:19:30,891
If it weren't for you

530
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:34,311
how much more could he have endured?

531
01:19:38,232 --> 01:19:39,358
I had no choice.

532
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:43,737
¡Jun-u!

533
01:19:44,071 --> 01:19:47,366
- I hope you understand. - Let him understand, damn it, crazy.

534
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:53,622
Yu-bin!

535
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:55,541
Yu-bin, are you there?

536
01:19:55,749 --> 01:19:56,625
Do you hear me?

537
01:19:57,209 --> 01:19:58,877
Answer me, Yu-bin!

538
01:19:59,169 --> 01:20:01,588
Is it wrong that I want to save my wife?

539
01:20:03,007 --> 01:20:06,010
Haven't you killed anyone already?

540
01:20:08,846 --> 01:20:09,722
That's how it is.

541
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:12,599
that we are still alive

542
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:14,643
means that both

543
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:16,312
we are equal.

544
01:20:16,395 --> 01:20:17,354
Mister.

545
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:19,398
Sir, just a moment.

546
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:23,235
Wait. Let's talk, okay?

547
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:24,194
Alright.

548
01:20:25,029 --> 01:20:26,155
It's alright then.

549
01:20:39,001 --> 01:20:40,502
¡Jun-u!

550
01:20:43,297 --> 01:20:45,090
Jesus please!

551
01:20:46,717 --> 01:20:48,135
Why don't you let us live?

552
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:50,971
What's with us?

553
01:20:51,555 --> 01:20:53,932
Do you think our lives are worthless?

554
01:20:54,975 --> 01:20:58,520
So leave the girl and go.

555
01:20:59,772 --> 01:21:01,023
I will spare your life.

556
01:21:02,816 --> 01:21:04,651
You can take all my food.

557
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:07,237
Just this time.

558
01:21:08,989 --> 01:21:10,032
Bloody!

559
01:21:10,115 --> 01:21:13,619
- Just this time! - One more step and I'll kill him!

560
01:21:14,203 --> 01:21:18,415
- Just forget about us and go! - Back off!

561
01:21:18,499 --> 01:21:20,250
I'll kill him if he gets close!

562
01:21:25,255 --> 01:21:26,090
No!

563
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:29,885
Yu-bin!

564
01:21:31,261 --> 01:21:32,971
Yu-bin!

565
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:56,161
Dear.

566
01:22:01,542 --> 01:22:02,418
Dear!

567
01:22:03,419 --> 01:22:06,296
- Yubin! - Dear!

568
01:22:13,637 --> 01:22:14,638
Alright.

569
01:22:18,475 --> 01:22:20,769
It's okay sweetheart.

570
01:22:26,525 --> 01:22:27,943
I know you did your best.

571
01:22:36,702 --> 01:22:37,786
Alright.

572
01:22:45,461 --> 01:22:46,628
Of...

573
01:22:48,464 --> 01:22:49,339
was over.

574
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:35,844
Jun-u.

575
01:23:51,985 --> 01:23:53,570
We're still human, you know?

576
01:23:55,239 --> 01:23:56,240
And we are together.

577
01:24:02,913 --> 01:24:04,206
It's OK now.

578
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:07,000
No.

579
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:10,671
No.

580
01:25:05,517 --> 01:25:07,102
Shit!

581
01:25:20,198 --> 01:25:22,826
One moment. Wait a second.

582
01:25:34,087 --> 01:25:35,255
What the hell...?

583
01:25:35,339 --> 01:25:36,340
Curse.

584
01:25:42,346 --> 01:25:43,597
Ceiling. The rooftop!

585
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,807
- Wait, this thing... - The rooftop!

586
01:25:45,891 --> 01:25:47,142
- Shit! - Hurry up!

587
01:25:47,225 --> 01:25:48,935
Where is the scissors?

588
01:26:21,635 --> 01:26:23,762
Hey, move on! Out of the way!

589
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:26,515
Move! I said out!

590
01:26:48,745 --> 01:26:49,871
Come on! Fast!

591
01:27:05,262 --> 01:27:06,346
Yu-bin!

592
01:27:20,944 --> 01:27:21,778
Escape!

593
01:27:22,362 --> 01:27:23,405
¡Jun-u!

594
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:27,451
Just go away! Go upstairs and take the helicopter!

595
01:27:29,411 --> 01:27:30,620
You must hurry!

596
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:06,531
No.

597
01:28:07,032 --> 01:28:08,158
No.

598
01:28:20,587 --> 01:28:21,630
Damn!

599
01:28:24,716 --> 01:28:27,469
Curse! Shit apartment!

600
01:28:37,771 --> 01:28:39,564
The helicopter. Where is?

601
01:28:53,745 --> 01:28:55,497
Here are survivors.

602
01:28:56,206 --> 01:28:57,833
Here are survivors!

603
01:28:59,668 --> 01:29:01,461
Here are survivors!

604
01:29:03,964 --> 01:29:06,091
Here are survivors!

605
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:09,511
Here are survivors!

606
01:29:10,303 --> 01:29:13,014
We are still alive!

607
01:29:14,057 --> 01:29:16,434
Here!

608
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:19,354
Here are survivors!

609
01:29:21,022 --> 01:29:23,984
- We're still... - There are survivors here!

610
01:29:24,067 --> 01:29:26,236
We are still alive.

611
01:31:16,054 --> 01:31:18,515
This is Kilo 717 Bravo Foxtrot Papa.

612
01:31:18,598 --> 01:31:20,892
We rescued two from the Eunsol Complex.

613
01:31:20,976 --> 01:31:23,728
This is Kilo 717 Bravo Foxtrot Papa.

614
01:31:23,812 --> 01:31:26,481
We rescued two from the Eunsol Complex.

615
01:31:26,564 --> 01:31:29,067
We're taking you to Tango Two, over.

616
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:33,571
MESSAGES

617
01:31:55,885 --> 01:31:59,931
It is impossible to know the exact number of infected,

618
01:32:00,015 --> 01:32:03,768
but authorities estimate at least 50,000 nationwide.

619
01:32:03,935 --> 01:32:07,355
The metropolitan area has been the hardest hit

620
01:32:07,439 --> 01:32:10,650
by the complexes, with little space between the units.

621
01:32:10,734 --> 01:32:15,530
The rescue team focuses on the survivors of those areas

622
01:32:15,613 --> 01:32:19,868
by tracking SOS messages posted on social networks.

623
01:32:19,951 --> 01:32:24,330
Wireless and internet networks were or are being restored,

624
01:32:24,414 --> 01:32:27,333
so SOS messages have been effective.

625
01:32:27,417 --> 01:32:31,171
The Central for Disaster Response and Security Measures

626
01:32:31,254 --> 01:32:34,758
will promote a campaign that encourages all survivors

627
01:32:34,841 --> 01:32:37,343
to post your location on social media.

628
01:32:40,555 --> 01:32:46,311
#I MUST_SURVIVE

629
01:32:50,857 --> 01:32:55,361
#ALIVE

630
01:37:53,910 --> 01:37:57,705
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES AND EVENTS IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

631
01:37:57,789 --> 01:38:02,085
ITS SIMILARITY WITH REAL PEOPLE, PLACES AND EVENTS IS PURE COINCIDENCE

632
01:38:08,716 --> 01:38:10,385
