Human body parts

4
00:01:56,001 --> 00:01:58,543
were discovered by lake.

5
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:02,542
Also last night,
a garbage truck ran over a man,

6
00:02:02,543 --> 00:02:06,375
who ran out of an alley
without looking at the signs.

7
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:10,917
The police arrested a man
in his 40s last night,

8
00:02:10,918 --> 00:02:14,001
who amassed and stole $1
million investment money.

9
00:02:28,751 --> 00:02:29,851
Holy cow!

10
00:02:31,876 --> 00:02:33,126
What the...

11
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:03,418
Dammit!

12
00:03:09,751 --> 00:03:10,851
Hey.

13
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:15,459
Someone forgot this.

14
00:03:15,668 --> 00:03:17,917
He came before dawn,

15
00:03:17,918 --> 00:03:19,751
but left and hasn't come back.

16
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:22,000
I'll put it in the storage.

17
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:23,101
Okay.

18
00:05:03,126 --> 00:05:06,168
I told you to put on the diaper.

19
00:05:07,251 --> 00:05:09,875
I'm not 3 years old, why should I?

20
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,543
Or use the toilet.

21
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:15,459
How could she clean after you every time?

22
00:05:16,376 --> 00:05:18,168
Think about her for once.

23
00:05:18,626 --> 00:05:21,542
She doesn't work at the shop at all,

24
00:05:21,543 --> 00:05:23,959
she just fools around at home.

25
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:26,168
Don't say things like that.

26
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,293
Your father worked hard for that shop.

27
00:05:30,793 --> 00:05:35,334
If you work so lazily,
all the regulars will leave.

28
00:05:51,709 --> 00:05:54,126
She was going to the shop earlier,

29
00:05:54,334 --> 00:05:57,043
I barely stopped her by the beach stairs,

30
00:05:58,001 --> 00:06:01,668
she kept yelling at me,
saying I'm killing her.

31
00:06:02,334 --> 00:06:04,668
She'll mention it, just so you know.

32
00:06:08,793 --> 00:06:09,893
I got it.

33
00:06:12,126 --> 00:06:14,126
And Yoon-hee called.

34
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,626
She couldn't get student loan,

35
00:06:19,168 --> 00:06:21,168
she'll take a semester off to work.

00:07:03,001 --> 00:07:04,101
Next.

39
00:07:11,168 --> 00:07:12,543
Look at the camera.

Look!

45
00:07:57,709 --> 00:07:58,834
Go inside.

46
00:08:01,876 --> 00:08:04,418
Dumbass, he met a wrong woman.

47
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:16,209
Mr. Port officer!

48
00:08:17,501 --> 00:08:18,601
Mr. PARK!

49
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:22,418
My handsome officer!

50
00:08:23,543 --> 00:08:24,959
This way.

51
00:08:26,001 --> 00:08:28,125
They should've cleaned it up.

52
00:08:28,126 --> 00:08:29,375
Over here.

53
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:30,834
Shit...

54
00:08:31,251 --> 00:08:32,751
Did you have dinner?

55
00:08:33,251 --> 00:08:34,459
I'm fine.

00:08:35,001 --> 00:08:37,168
Let's see!

00:08:37,876 --> 00:08:39,209
Now.

Let's have a moment of truth.

59
00:08:47,334 --> 00:08:48,626
Could I...

60
00:08:49,876 --> 00:08:51,834
get a little more time?

61
00:08:55,126 --> 00:08:56,876
What are you doing?

62
00:08:57,126 --> 00:09:01,251
I remember you promising
to pay me back today.

63
00:09:02,001 --> 00:09:03,501
You said so yourself,

64
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:08,583
I can have your wrist
if you break the promise.

65
00:09:08,584 --> 00:09:09,793
My wrist?

66
00:09:12,626 --> 00:09:14,793
We didn't talk about that.

67
00:09:15,293 --> 00:09:17,584
Goddammit...

68
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:21,334
If it wasn't for Yeon-hee,
I wouldn't be here.

69
00:09:21,376 --> 00:09:22,917
You know I'm a victim too.

70
00:09:22,918 --> 00:09:24,876
So what then?

71
00:09:25,251 --> 00:09:27,708
You co-signed her loan,

72
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:31,958
if you feel so wronged,
then bring her here.

73
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:34,501
If I can, I'd do that right away!

74
00:09:34,668 --> 00:09:37,375
But she disappeared without a trace,

75
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:40,251
and left all her stuff at my place.

76
00:09:40,793 --> 00:09:41,893
Mr. PARK,

77
00:09:42,501 --> 00:09:44,626
please give me one more week.

78
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,292
I got a lead for that money.

79
00:09:47,293 --> 00:09:48,542

80
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,918
Come on...

81
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:56,584
It's a trade secret.

82
00:09:58,376 --> 00:09:59,918
Just one week.

83
00:10:01,043 --> 00:10:04,751
I'll pay everything back with interest!

84
00:10:06,584 --> 00:10:11,876
If you miss it again, he'll swing by.

85
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:15,376
He likes eating intestines.

86
00:10:19,084 --> 00:10:20,750
Fish, animal, or people,

87
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:24,501
he's gotta have them raw.

88
00:10:29,376 --> 00:10:30,834

Yes, thank you.

99

She cares so much for you.

100
00:11:47,876 --> 00:11:49,709
- Feeling good?
- Yes.

Okay.

105
00:12:09,376 --> 00:12:11,043
Wait...

106
00:12:11,334 --> 00:12:12,709
I'll take her.

107
00:12:13,168 --> 00:12:15,918
Took you long enough.

108
00:12:16,876 --> 00:12:18,376
Have a great time!

109
00:12:18,751 --> 00:12:19,959
Hello there.

Yes.

112
00:12:28,876 --> 00:12:30,168
Where exactly?

113
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:32,918
You know Huanren?

What brings you here?

115
00:12:38,834 --> 00:12:40,001

What did you do?

117
00:12:46,584 --> 00:12:48,293
I killed a man.

118
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:57,918
I'm kidding.

119
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:00,376
Came to make money, what else?

Hey.

Do you still not get
the situation we're in?

128

I'm sorry, it's all my fault.

Did you get the money in cash?

Too many cameras at train station,

150

so take the bus.

pretending to be busy.

00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:09,001
or car records,

175
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:14,293
if it's over a month,
he said she could be dead.

176
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:17,000
She's not someone who'd die so easily.

177
00:17:17,001 --> 00:17:21,042
She was still my girl!

178
00:17:21,043 --> 00:17:23,834
You still haven't snapped out!

179
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:27,709
I told you,
she wiped you out and just took off.

180
00:17:28,251 --> 00:17:30,333
I'm sure you had some fun starting out,

181
00:17:30,334 --> 00:17:31,958
then when shit hits the fan,

182
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:35,125
gold diggers take off.

183
00:17:35,126 --> 00:17:37,750
You were so clueless!

184
00:17:37,751 --> 00:17:41,126
You were like, "Yeon-hee! I love you!"

185
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:48,543
Thank you.

186
00:17:50,251 --> 00:17:51,917
You're worried about me.

187
00:17:51,918 --> 00:17:52,751
I'm sorry.

188
00:17:52,752 --> 00:17:54,668
No, really.

189
00:17:55,084 --> 00:17:59,043
So I have something to tell you.

190
00:17:59,459 --> 00:18:01,278
You're trying to get me to do something!

191
00:18:02,793 --> 00:18:04,125
It's nothing like that.

192
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:05,226
Come on...

193
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:06,834
What is it?

194
00:18:08,668 --> 00:18:09,768
Carp!

195
00:18:10,876 --> 00:18:13,501
Carp, my brother!

196
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:17,125
I baited a major sucker.

197
00:18:17,126 --> 00:18:19,668
I knew you were up to something!

198
00:18:19,793 --> 00:18:21,334
It was nice seeing you.

199
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:23,958
We're family, man.

200
00:18:23,959 --> 00:18:25,958
You're distant cousin of distant cousin!

201
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:29,709
People can't tell us
apart, don't you know that?

202
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:31,709
You don't see your face in me?

203
00:18:37,251 --> 00:18:38,668
Forget it.

204
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:43,876
100 large, all in cash.

205
00:18:45,668 --> 00:18:49,334
It's too much for me to handle alone.

206
00:18:50,001 --> 00:18:51,584
I'll have to take it all.

207
00:18:52,043 --> 00:18:55,500
What kind of idiot carries
around that much cash?

208
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,876
I know, there is.

209
00:18:59,168 --> 00:19:01,168
It's definitely fishy.

210
00:19:02,293 --> 00:19:03,543
Indeed.

211
00:19:04,501 --> 00:19:07,209
That's why he can't report
it even if we take it.

212
00:19:07,918 --> 00:19:09,043
You getting it?

213
00:19:10,626 --> 00:19:13,834
You always bitch and
moan about your gambling debt.

214
00:19:14,209 --> 00:19:17,000
It's your chance to pay
all that back in one go.

215
00:19:17,001 --> 00:19:18,709
Too bad, forget it.

216
00:19:21,459 --> 00:19:23,251
What kind of sucker did you hook?

217
00:19:25,668 --> 00:19:29,668
He's my high school friend.

218
00:19:30,168 --> 00:19:34,458
He asked me to look for a way
out of the country

219
00:19:34,459 --> 00:19:38,126
after hitting big in Seoul
in exchange for a 20% cut.

220
00:19:38,918 --> 00:19:41,543
I'll bring him to him
to the port tomorrow,

221
00:19:41,709 --> 00:19:46,043
and when I signal you,
just walk away with the bag,

222
00:19:46,709 --> 00:19:49,959
then I'll take card of the rest.

223
00:19:58,876 --> 00:20:00,959
You sure this is legit?

224
00:20:02,376 --> 00:20:04,543
You worry too much.

225
00:20:04,584 --> 00:20:06,168
Worrying will get you killed.

226
00:20:06,501 --> 00:20:09,293
I worry because you make me worry.

227
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:11,918
Don't you worry.

228
00:20:12,334 --> 00:20:14,125
I'll take care of you.

229
00:20:14,126 --> 00:20:16,251
You can't do shit on your own.

230
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:32,668
You're late 3 minutes.

231
00:20:36,918 --> 00:20:40,292
Sorry, I had some problems at home...

232
00:20:40,293 --> 00:20:42,334
Who doesn't have problems at home?

233
00:20:42,834 --> 00:20:44,043
I told you,

234
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:48,084
if you're late twice in a month,
you're fired.

235
00:20:48,251 --> 00:20:50,418
- Yes, I know.
- Also...

236
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:53,208
soda runs low pretty quickly,

237
00:20:53,209 --> 00:20:54,668
do you know why?

238
00:20:58,709 --> 00:21:02,625
They're popular
because of the hot weather.

239
00:21:02,626 --> 00:21:05,751
Sales and order volumes don't match up.

240
00:21:06,876 --> 00:21:07,976
That's all.

241
00:21:08,543 --> 00:21:10,043
You better watch out.

242
00:21:10,293 --> 00:21:12,376
I shouldn't have hired the old one.

243
00:21:16,459 --> 00:21:17,043
I'm off.

244
00:21:17,044 --> 00:21:19,293
- Watch out, okay?
- Okay.

245
00:21:20,793 --> 00:21:22,417
- Oh yeah!
- What?

246
00:21:22,418 --> 00:21:25,459
Did anyone come for the bag?

247
00:21:25,668 --> 00:21:26,768
No.

248
00:21:27,501 --> 00:21:29,320
But there was a guy looking for someone.

249
00:21:29,418 --> 00:21:31,042
- Someone?
- Yes.

250
00:21:31,043 --> 00:21:32,834
Someone went missing near here.

251
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:35,501
He left a flyer. Check it out.

252
00:21:36,084 --> 00:21:37,184
See you!

"Missing Person"

254
00:21:57,293 --> 00:21:59,501
I didn't text you for this.

255
00:22:00,918 --> 00:22:04,584
Liar, wasn't this what you were after?

256
00:22:05,126 --> 00:22:06,418
It wasn't.

257
00:22:08,251 --> 00:22:09,584
It felt good.

258
00:22:11,126 --> 00:22:12,226
Yeah?

259
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:16,543
I have to go now.

260
00:22:22,126 --> 00:22:23,793
Do you have to work that job?

261
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:26,918
Or will you give me money?

262
00:22:30,876 --> 00:22:32,084
What's that?

263
00:22:32,543 --> 00:22:34,584
Huh? What?

264
00:22:35,084 --> 00:22:36,501
Your husband did that to you?

265
00:22:36,793 --> 00:22:38,168
It's nothing like that.

266
00:22:43,043 --> 00:22:44,334
So it is.

267
00:22:44,751 --> 00:22:46,501
How could you live with him?

268
00:22:47,793 --> 00:22:48,893
Let go!

269
00:22:50,501 --> 00:22:52,043
It's not your concern.

270
00:23:00,418 --> 00:23:01,584
You know what?

271
00:23:01,751 --> 00:23:05,126
Woman beaters will never
change their habit.

272
00:23:07,626 --> 00:23:09,418
My fucking dad was like that.

273
00:23:09,668 --> 00:23:12,376
He was beating up my mom one day,

274
00:23:12,418 --> 00:23:14,084
so I stepped in.

275
00:23:14,334 --> 00:23:15,959
You know what's funny?

276
00:23:16,584 --> 00:23:19,126
Mom was the one who stopped me.

277
00:23:21,084 --> 00:23:22,459
I knew it then.

278
00:23:22,793 --> 00:23:25,626
I realized how scary getting
used to something is.

279
00:23:29,043 --> 00:23:33,043
Do you want to get beaten up
all your life like my mom?

280
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:38,209
If not, end this quickly.

Dad, over here.

284
00:24:13,876 --> 00:24:16,250
I came from Seoul and
still got here earlier than you.

285
00:24:16,251 --> 00:24:17,959
I couldn't find a replacement.

286
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:20,209
Sorry.

287
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,708
Your work doesn't give you a break?

288
00:24:21,709 --> 00:24:22,959
Be quiet.

289
00:24:23,959 --> 00:24:25,251
What happened?

290
00:24:26,084 --> 00:24:29,543
I tried to stop mother
from going to the shop.

291
00:24:32,501 --> 00:24:34,293
Dammit...

292
00:24:36,001 --> 00:24:39,543
She went nuts,
saying I was trying to kill her.

293
00:24:40,459 --> 00:24:42,834
I can't do this anymore.

294
00:24:45,501 --> 00:24:46,709

the police are searching
the bars in town...

00:24:56,251 --> 00:24:58,251
When's that bitch coming?

299
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:01,543
Could you stop calling her that?

300
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:04,418
She pushed me on the stairs.

301
00:25:04,793 --> 00:25:06,708
What do you mean?

302
00:25:06,709 --> 00:25:09,583
She's the one who fell down the stairs!

303
00:25:09,584 --> 00:25:12,834
You didn't see how dangerous it was!

304
00:25:12,876 --> 00:25:16,543
She's like that to me
because you're so laxed.

305
00:25:45,918 --> 00:25:48,418
Why isn't this bastard answering me?

Yo, Carp.

00:25:56,251 --> 00:25:59,334
Not here yet? It's been so long!

309
00:25:59,626 --> 00:26:01,292
I can't reach him.

310
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:02,584
Did he take off?

311
00:26:02,959 --> 00:26:04,250
Maybe he pretended to come here

312
00:26:04,251 --> 00:26:06,376
to divert the cops away from him.

313
00:26:06,418 --> 00:26:08,668
No, he only trusts me.

314
00:26:08,709 --> 00:26:09,809
Dude.

315
00:26:10,043 --> 00:26:14,876
Those with big money don't trust others.

316
00:26:15,001 --> 00:26:16,084
Shouldn't trust anyone either.

317
00:26:16,085 --> 00:26:18,667
- But he's totally...
- Whatever.

318
00:26:18,668 --> 00:26:21,168
I gotta head back, I'm hanging up.

319
00:26:21,209 --> 00:26:24,084
Hey, wait a bit longer! Son of a...

320
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,918
Where the hell did he go?

Excuse me.

322
00:26:35,001 --> 00:26:35,918
Yes?

323
00:26:36,001 --> 00:26:37,834

I see. How can I help you?

00:26:40,918 --> 00:26:43,543
Do you know this man?

326
00:26:43,626 --> 00:26:45,709
His name is OH Dong-pal.

327
00:26:46,668 --> 00:26:47,959
I don't really know.

328
00:26:48,876 --> 00:26:52,668
Where could he be?

329
00:26:54,376 --> 00:26:56,375
Thank you.

330
00:26:56,376 --> 00:26:58,168
Okay, take care.

331
00:26:59,334 --> 00:27:00,434
Wait a minute.

332
00:27:02,334 --> 00:27:05,126
You sure you don't know him?

333
00:27:09,501 --> 00:27:11,918
- I don't...
- Mr. KANG.

334
00:27:12,251 --> 00:27:14,418
Didn't you go to Pyeongtaek High?

335
00:27:15,126 --> 00:27:18,042
Which year? I wrote it down.

336
00:27:18,043 --> 00:27:21,584
I'm from PH too, class of '85.

OH Dong-pal? I don't really know...

341
00:27:34,209 --> 00:27:36,459
It's raining.

342
00:27:36,793 --> 00:27:37,918
One second.

343
00:27:39,793 --> 00:27:40,893
What the hell?

344
00:27:43,459 --> 00:27:46,501
Where the hell did OH go?

345
00:27:47,626 --> 00:27:49,834
It's nice bumping into alum.

346
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,543
Good to meet you, sir.

347
00:27:53,084 --> 00:27:56,459
So this OH Dong-pal is my friend Dong-pal.

348
00:27:56,751 --> 00:27:58,501
I didn't recognize him like this.

349
00:27:59,209 --> 00:28:01,126
Did he really pull a scam?

350
00:28:02,209 --> 00:28:04,418
He was a model student.

351
00:28:06,293 --> 00:28:09,876
I understand your position.

352
00:28:11,334 --> 00:28:15,626
It's awful to think that
your friend is a wanted man.

353
00:28:16,209 --> 00:28:17,834
I'd hide it too.

354
00:28:20,543 --> 00:28:22,168
Did he ever contact you?

355
00:28:23,543 --> 00:28:24,643
What?

356
00:28:27,209 --> 00:28:29,084
No, never.

357
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:35,668
We've never kept in touch,

358
00:28:35,876 --> 00:28:38,876
if my number comes up on his phone,
then I...

359
00:28:41,501 --> 00:28:43,876
Have you checked his call log?

360
00:28:44,084 --> 00:28:45,184
Already did.

361
00:28:45,793 --> 00:28:48,250
I think he's using a burner phone.

362
00:28:48,251 --> 00:28:50,668
Burner phone?

363
00:28:51,876 --> 00:28:54,209
He really is in deep.

364
00:28:55,084 --> 00:28:58,751
Anyway, he has never contacted me.

365
00:28:59,709 --> 00:29:04,459
If you don't believe me,
check it out yourself.

366
00:29:06,376 --> 00:29:07,476
It's okay.

367
00:29:08,084 --> 00:29:10,168
Even if he called,
you probably deleted it.

368
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:16,459
- Let's take a selfie.
- What?

369
00:29:19,001 --> 00:29:20,209
Smile.

370
00:29:21,709 --> 00:29:22,959
That's good.

371
00:29:25,834 --> 00:29:27,126
Are you married?

372
00:29:27,543 --> 00:29:28,643
Nope.

373
00:29:28,918 --> 00:29:30,043
Girlfriend?

374
00:29:31,251 --> 00:29:32,351
None.

375
00:29:32,959 --> 00:29:36,418
You look handsome enough,
what do you live for?

376
00:29:36,876 --> 00:29:39,501
Enjoy life, have some fun.

377
00:29:41,001 --> 00:29:42,101
Okay.

378
00:29:49,209 --> 00:29:51,334
How did you know my number?

379
00:29:52,043 --> 00:29:53,626
That's not even work.

380
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,209
Let's bar hop.

381
00:29:58,584 --> 00:30:00,418
Know any hot bars in town?

382
00:30:01,709 --> 00:30:03,125
I'm done for the night...

383
00:30:03,126 --> 00:30:04,543
Gonna go home?

384
00:30:06,626 --> 00:30:08,751
No, let's go.

385
00:30:09,543 --> 00:30:10,668
Nice!

386
00:30:12,918 --> 00:30:14,501
One second.

387
00:30:18,293 --> 00:30:20,293
Sergeant, did you get anything?

388
00:30:21,626 --> 00:30:22,793
It's OH Dong-pal?

389
00:30:23,126 --> 00:30:24,668
Understood, hold on.

390
00:30:25,709 --> 00:30:29,000
Why don't you do your thing?

391
00:30:29,001 --> 00:30:30,250
I got work to do.

392
00:30:30,251 --> 00:30:32,543
- I see.
- And, uh...

393
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:34,376
Thanks for the meal.

394
00:30:35,001 --> 00:30:36,209
Okay...

395
00:30:39,709 --> 00:30:41,083
Let me use this umbrella?

396
00:30:41,084 --> 00:30:42,184
- Sure.
- Thanks!

397
00:30:48,126 --> 00:30:49,334
Son of a bitch.

398
00:30:50,834 --> 00:30:53,126
He had to eat just the expensive ones?

399
00:30:56,376 --> 00:30:58,376
"PARK Du-man"

400
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:01,459
Jesus Christ...

401
00:31:10,293 --> 00:31:11,393
He looks like a fucker.

402
00:31:14,543 --> 00:31:17,418
I'll take care of it, so get some sleep.

403
00:31:19,251 --> 00:31:21,043
Without this fucker

404
00:31:21,834 --> 00:31:23,668
We'll be happy.

405
00:32:03,501 --> 00:32:04,601
Mom!

406
00:32:34,168 --> 00:32:36,293
Hello, good evening!

407
00:32:36,668 --> 00:32:38,417
It's very last minute,

408
00:32:38,418 --> 00:32:39,334
but I think I'll be late.

409
00:32:39,335 --> 00:32:40,918
Ah Shit

410
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:44,084
I told you, late 2 times,
and you're fired.

411
00:32:44,126 --> 00:32:45,376
I'm really sorry.

412
00:32:45,834 --> 00:32:47,000
I'll get there as soon as possible.

413
00:32:47,001 --> 00:32:49,084
Forget it, don't come.

414
00:32:49,209 --> 00:32:50,309
What?

415
00:32:50,543 --> 00:32:53,250
Don't come in, you're fired.

416
00:32:53,251 --> 00:32:56,918
Wait, I'll be honest with you.

417
00:32:57,543 --> 00:32:59,376
My mother is not well.

418
00:33:00,626 --> 00:33:02,667
And my wife's not well too.

419
00:33:02,668 --> 00:33:07,625
How many times do I have to tell you?
Everyone has problems at home.

420
00:33:07,626 --> 00:33:09,500
- Forget it!
- It's not so simple...

421
00:33:09,501 --> 00:33:10,959
No need to come in anymore.

422
00:33:11,001 --> 00:33:11,793
What a moron.

423
00:33:11,959 --> 00:33:13,126
Hello?

424
00:33:14,001 --> 00:33:15,101
Hello?

425
00:33:24,001 --> 00:33:25,459
Dammit.

426
00:33:27,584 --> 00:33:28,834
Fuck, the bag!

427
00:33:41,834 --> 00:33:45,293
It's called Navi Bar by the station,

428
00:33:45,793 --> 00:33:47,667
he usually drinks alone

429
00:33:47,668 --> 00:33:50,376
and comes home at 2 or 3 AM.

430
00:34:40,126 --> 00:34:42,043
"Jin-tae"

431
00:34:44,043 --> 00:34:45,209
I did it.

432
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:47,834
I killed him!

433
00:34:53,459 --> 00:34:54,668
Did you hear me?

434
00:34:54,834 --> 00:34:57,251
He's dead, your hubby is dead!

435
00:34:57,876 --> 00:35:00,209
I hear you fine, lower your voice.

436
00:35:00,543 --> 00:35:02,793
It's okay, I'm in my car.

437
00:35:03,584 --> 00:35:04,684
Where are you now?

438
00:35:05,459 --> 00:35:06,751
On the way from Mt. Mubong.

439
00:35:07,626 --> 00:35:08,726
What for?

440
00:35:09,418 --> 00:35:10,918
I buried him there.

441
00:35:11,501 --> 00:35:12,834
Buried him?

442
00:35:14,084 --> 00:35:16,084
I told you it had to be a car accident.

443
00:35:16,376 --> 00:35:17,918
Something came up.

444
00:35:18,584 --> 00:35:22,001
I'll call you back later,
my battery's almost dead.

445
00:35:22,084 --> 00:35:23,293
Wait...

446
00:35:31,251 --> 00:35:32,351
Shit...

447
00:35:32,376 --> 00:35:34,500
"Insurance policy
for the missing personal cases"

448
00:35:34,501 --> 00:35:38,251
declared dead 5 years
after missing report...

449
00:35:41,043 --> 00:35:43,584
How am I supposed to wait 5 years?

450
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:10,418
Did you see a ghost?

451
00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:29,334
Come, sit over here, right here.

452
00:36:29,834 --> 00:36:32,501
Oh my.

453
00:36:34,418 --> 00:36:35,543
So.

454
00:36:37,834 --> 00:36:39,293
I heard you got a sucker.

455
00:36:40,709 --> 00:36:42,293
- Sucker?
- Yes.

456
00:36:43,043 --> 00:36:44,251
What sucker?

457
00:36:44,543 --> 00:36:46,180
I heard a ton of money is coming in.

458
00:36:47,209 --> 00:36:49,918
Summer bonus!

459
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:52,543
I received a puny bonus, you know that.

460
00:36:52,959 --> 00:36:54,667
Mr. dear officer...

461
00:36:54,668 --> 00:36:58,417
You're the best at playing dumb.

462
00:36:58,418 --> 00:36:59,518
Iichiban!

463
00:37:02,043 --> 00:37:03,417
Yo, Carp.

464
00:37:03,418 --> 00:37:04,876
You said so, didn't you?

465
00:37:05,251 --> 00:37:08,209
That he found a sucker with a ton of cash.

466
00:37:09,251 --> 00:37:10,209
You told me so, haven't you?

467
00:37:10,209 --> 00:37:11,309
I never said that...

468
00:37:11,334 --> 00:37:14,333
You punk ass bitch,
don't lie to me, asshole!

469
00:37:14,334 --> 00:37:15,793
I'll cut off your tongue!

470
00:37:17,709 --> 00:37:20,209
Mr. PARK, Mr. PARK!

471
00:37:20,584 --> 00:37:24,625
You know how hard I'm trying
to get you that money.

472
00:37:24,626 --> 00:37:29,250
And it hasn't been a week
since we made that promise.

473
00:37:29,251 --> 00:37:31,043
Look, right?

474
00:37:34,584 --> 00:37:37,209
- Carp, come here.
- Yes, sir.

475
00:37:43,668 --> 00:37:46,083
Do you know what you just did, asshole?

476
00:37:46,084 --> 00:37:50,001
You tricked our innocent
and kind Mr. Port Officer.

477
00:37:50,126 --> 00:37:52,251
Did you hear what he said?

478
00:37:52,918 --> 00:37:56,042
He said he'll pay back even if

479
00:37:56,043 --> 00:37:57,750
his intestines are spilling out.

480
00:37:57,751 --> 00:38:01,542
How could you mock someone like him?

481
00:38:01,543 --> 00:38:05,126
That's why you're no better than a carp.

482
00:38:09,543 --> 00:38:11,043
Isn't that right?

483
00:38:11,084 --> 00:38:12,184
Sure.

484
00:38:14,418 --> 00:38:16,001
What are you doing?

485
00:38:16,709 --> 00:38:19,293
Come beg for his forgiveness.

486
00:38:22,001 --> 00:38:23,459
I'm sorry...

487
00:38:24,293 --> 00:38:25,792
I'm so sorry, sir...

488
00:38:25,793 --> 00:38:30,583
No, no, this isn't good enough.

489
00:38:30,584 --> 00:38:32,042
- What?
- Right.

490
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:35,751
This is the perfect
opportunity to take a wrist.

491
00:38:35,918 --> 00:38:37,237
- Wrist?
- Let's chop one off.

492
00:38:37,584 --> 00:38:39,084
Boss, I'm sorry!

493
00:38:42,459 --> 00:38:45,375
He's right!

494
00:38:45,376 --> 00:38:47,209
He's right about the sucker!

495
00:38:47,293 --> 00:38:48,543
I told Carp about it!

496
00:38:49,626 --> 00:38:51,126
You only told him about it?

497
00:38:51,501 --> 00:38:53,918
So Carp wasn't lying?

498
00:38:55,168 --> 00:38:56,334
I don't think so.

499
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:57,793
You don't think so?

500
00:38:58,751 --> 00:39:00,126
He didn't lie!

501
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:04,042
Sir, what's all this for?

502
00:39:04,043 --> 00:39:07,458
Then I owe Carp a major apology!

503
00:39:07,459 --> 00:39:10,583
Why are you making me into a bad guy?

504
00:39:10,584 --> 00:39:12,251
Let him go.

505
00:39:12,293 --> 00:39:15,126
He gets so enthusiastic
when he holds a knife.

506
00:39:15,459 --> 00:39:17,793
I'm sorry, boss...

507
00:39:21,793 --> 00:39:22,959
So what then?

508
00:39:26,001 --> 00:39:28,334
When do we reel in the sucker?

509
00:39:28,376 --> 00:39:29,476
What?

510
00:39:37,626 --> 00:39:39,418
What will you do now?

511
00:39:39,501 --> 00:39:40,876
Isn't it obvious?

512
00:39:41,626 --> 00:39:43,251
We gotta find the sucker.

513
00:39:44,459 --> 00:39:47,833
He's long gone! We can't find him!

514
00:39:47,834 --> 00:39:48,934
Carp.

515
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:57,209
This cop came from Seoul to get him.

516
00:39:57,418 --> 00:39:59,209
He's a big snake,

517
00:39:59,376 --> 00:40:02,084
and he's going around asking about him.

518
00:40:02,584 --> 00:40:05,751
Why don't you follow him around?

519
00:40:06,209 --> 00:40:08,793
He'll definitely get some info on him.

520
00:40:09,084 --> 00:40:11,876
Now you're asking me to follow a cop?!

521
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:13,625
He already knows my face!

522
00:40:13,626 --> 00:40:14,668
What the shit!

523
00:40:14,669 --> 00:40:16,292
We don't have a lot of choices!

524
00:40:16,293 --> 00:40:19,417
There is no 'us'! Leave me out of this!

525
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:21,333
I'm begging you!

526
00:40:21,334 --> 00:40:23,668
Didn't you hear what Mr. PARK said?

527
00:40:23,918 --> 00:40:27,667
He put our hands together,
and said to get the sucker!

528
00:40:27,668 --> 00:40:29,918
Just stop it! Please!

529
00:40:34,876 --> 00:40:35,976
Carp.

530
00:40:38,001 --> 00:40:39,168
Don't worry.

531
00:40:40,834 --> 00:40:44,959
Do you know why I only smoke this?

532
00:40:46,376 --> 00:40:50,251
I was out with a colleague
on illegal aliens crackdown.

533
00:40:50,793 --> 00:40:53,084
Then I ran out of smokes.

534
00:40:53,626 --> 00:40:55,543
He said I could smoke his.

535
00:40:56,834 --> 00:41:00,168
But I craved Lucky Strike for some reason.

536
00:41:00,376 --> 00:41:02,251
A pack of Lucky Strike, please.

537
00:41:02,959 --> 00:41:05,876
Then out of nowhere,
a dump truck ran over the car.

538
00:41:19,793 --> 00:41:22,376
If I wasn't for Lucky strike,

539
00:41:23,001 --> 00:41:25,626
I'd be dead like him.

540
00:41:26,709 --> 00:41:28,501
This is the only thing

541
00:41:28,876 --> 00:41:32,543
that protected me, not God or ancestors.

542
00:41:34,876 --> 00:41:37,001
Fuck...

543
00:41:44,459 --> 00:41:46,251
The phone you're trying to call...

544
00:42:04,626 --> 00:42:07,626
A congratulatory gift.
Picked it up on the way...

545
00:42:13,084 --> 00:42:15,251
Then who did I kill?

546
00:42:15,668 --> 00:42:16,768
How should I know?

547
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:20,167
Oh shit... It was sure it was him!

548
00:42:20,168 --> 00:42:22,418
No, it was someone else!

549
00:42:23,376 --> 00:42:27,043
Your dead man is snoring in my apartment.

550
00:42:27,751 --> 00:42:29,751
See it for yourself
if you don't believe me!

551
00:42:36,543 --> 00:42:38,959
Fucking son of a bitch

552
00:42:44,543 --> 00:42:45,709
What should I do now?

553
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:55,626
You have to get rid of this car
and head back to China.

554
00:42:58,168 --> 00:43:00,043
Then I Won't get to see you.

555
00:43:01,418 --> 00:43:05,251
I'll wrap things up here
and follow you there.

556
00:43:05,959 --> 00:43:08,751
Let's just leave now then.

557
00:43:10,501 --> 00:43:12,459
Speak some sense.

558
00:43:13,293 --> 00:43:14,543
You got any money?

559
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:18,709
We'll need money to live.

560
00:43:20,126 --> 00:43:22,584
I'll make some no matter what,

561
00:43:23,543 --> 00:43:25,209
so you head over there first.

562
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:51,751
Dammit!

563
00:43:52,168 --> 00:43:53,751
Crazy bastard!

564
00:43:55,334 --> 00:43:56,918
Fucking idiot...

565
00:44:02,001 --> 00:44:03,918
That's 2 for $1.

566
00:44:04,126 --> 00:44:06,209
This one is $1.

567
00:44:15,793 --> 00:44:16,893
Good evening!

568
00:44:17,543 --> 00:44:18,959
$3, please.

569
00:44:19,918 --> 00:44:20,876
Good to see you.

570
00:44:20,877 --> 00:44:22,418
- Hello there.
- Take care.

571
00:44:22,501 --> 00:44:24,626
- Hello.
- Hey there.

572
00:44:25,501 --> 00:44:27,709
- Are you new?
- Yes.

573
00:44:27,751 --> 00:44:30,250
- I used to work here.
- I see.

574
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:32,501
- I came to get my stuff.
- Okay.

575
00:44:33,043 --> 00:44:36,083
It's in the storage,
I need the key for it.

576
00:44:36,084 --> 00:44:36,626
The key?

577
00:44:36,627 --> 00:44:38,293
Yes, for the storage.

578
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:41,293
- It's...
- It should be hanging there.

579
00:44:45,209 --> 00:44:46,251
Is this it?

580
00:44:46,252 --> 00:44:47,708
Yeah, that's the one.

581
00:44:47,709 --> 00:44:48,876
Thank you.

582
00:44:50,126 --> 00:44:51,750
Is the manager not in yet?

583
00:44:51,751 --> 00:44:53,500
No, he hasn't come yet.

584
00:44:53,501 --> 00:44:55,918
I wanted to say hello.

585
00:45:18,751 --> 00:45:22,084
I wanted to ask you,
have you seen this man?

586
00:45:22,334 --> 00:45:24,418
It's my first day today, so I don't know

587
00:45:24,751 --> 00:45:25,851
Thanks again.

588
00:45:26,668 --> 00:45:29,333
You should ask him, he used to work here.

589
00:45:29,334 --> 00:45:30,750
- Excuse me!
- Is that right?

590
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,876
One moment please.

591
00:45:31,959 --> 00:45:34,834
Excuse me, we're the police.

592
00:45:35,126 --> 00:45:36,168
Hello.

593
00:45:36,169 --> 00:45:37,668
Have you seen him before?

594
00:45:38,918 --> 00:45:39,793
No.

595
00:45:39,794 --> 00:45:41,626
Please look carefully.

596
00:45:44,334 --> 00:45:46,917
I've never seen him in my life.

597
00:45:46,918 --> 00:45:49,668
Is that so? Okay, thank you.

598
00:45:51,209 --> 00:45:53,875
Besides that man,
are there any other employees here?

599
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:56,293
Manager and a few patr-timers.

600
00:45:56,501 --> 00:45:58,543
Could I get the manager's number?

601
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:14,376
I told you not to come in.

602
00:46:14,876 --> 00:46:15,976
What are you doing here?

603
00:46:16,334 --> 00:46:18,168
I came to get my stuff.

604
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:21,334
You had that much stuff?

605
00:46:21,751 --> 00:46:24,459
Yes, I had some books here.

606
00:46:26,168 --> 00:46:27,987
You've been reading books while working.

607
00:46:28,709 --> 00:46:32,709
That's why we get bad service reviews.

608
00:46:33,918 --> 00:46:35,334
Where the hell is it?

609
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:36,893
Wait a minute.

610
00:46:38,418 --> 00:46:39,668
Could I look at that?

611
00:46:40,543 --> 00:46:41,334
What?

612
00:46:41,335 --> 00:46:44,293
I'm suddenly curious what books you read.

613
00:46:45,418 --> 00:46:46,751
They're novels.

614
00:46:48,293 --> 00:46:49,393
Novels?

615
00:46:50,251 --> 00:46:51,351
Yes.

616
00:46:51,959 --> 00:46:53,709
Let me see it, just in case.

617
00:46:55,959 --> 00:46:57,209
Just in case what?

618
00:46:58,043 --> 00:46:59,876
Suspecting me of something?

619
00:47:00,209 --> 00:47:01,251
Feeling guilty?

620
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:02,751
For what?

621
00:47:03,376 --> 00:47:06,126
I got nothing like that.

622
00:47:06,168 --> 00:47:07,750
Let me see it then!

623
00:47:07,751 --> 00:47:09,542
No, I got no reason to!

624
00:47:09,543 --> 00:47:11,208
I'll look at it because I want to see it!

625
00:47:11,209 --> 00:47:13,126
Why the hell for?!

626
00:47:16,918 --> 00:47:18,876
You still think I'm your employee?!

627
00:47:20,084 --> 00:47:22,001
Don't talk down at me!

628
00:47:23,084 --> 00:47:25,251
I've had it with you, kid!

629
00:47:26,959 --> 00:47:28,334
You got no manners!

630
00:47:32,751 --> 00:47:33,851
Behave yourself.

631
00:47:34,709 --> 00:47:38,251
Keep it up and I'll report you

632
00:47:39,001 --> 00:47:41,750
for skipping work to golf

633
00:47:41,751 --> 00:47:42,851
with female customers.

634
00:47:48,918 --> 00:47:50,251
By the way,

635
00:47:51,251 --> 00:47:56,168
I was the hardest working
and most ethical employee!

636
00:47:57,084 --> 00:47:58,184
Did you know?!

637
00:48:56,209 --> 00:48:58,668
I'll consider this
as your last chance to me.

638
00:49:03,001 --> 00:49:08,418
"Chapter 4: Shark"

639
00:49:11,084 --> 00:49:12,833
Get your shit together,
do you know who I am?

640
00:49:12,834 --> 00:49:15,501
My apologies sir,
she's not the one we confirmed to go.

641
00:49:16,043 --> 00:49:17,209
What is it?

642
00:49:18,084 --> 00:49:19,292
He's Mi-ran's regular,

643
00:49:19,293 --> 00:49:21,668
he wants a drink with her...

644
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,501
She's not taking any clients today.

645
00:49:26,918 --> 00:49:28,084
Who are you?

646
00:49:30,334 --> 00:49:32,209
I'm the boss here,

647
00:49:33,043 --> 00:49:34,793
do I have to do this?

648
00:49:36,501 --> 00:49:38,125
Sir, let's not stay here...

649
00:49:38,126 --> 00:49:40,334
Don't fucking touch me.

650
00:49:43,626 --> 00:49:45,168
You're the boss?

651
00:49:46,251 --> 00:49:50,126
You treat your customers like fucktards?

652
00:49:52,626 --> 00:49:54,251
Being a boss isn't all that.

653
00:49:55,043 --> 00:49:56,334
You fucking bitch!

654
00:49:58,834 --> 00:50:00,251
You hit me first.

655
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:05,684
Get rid of him.

656
00:50:07,293 --> 00:50:08,393
Come with me.

657
00:50:11,668 --> 00:50:13,418
Go on, get rid of him.

658
00:50:20,459 --> 00:50:21,709
Drink.

659
00:50:28,918 --> 00:50:30,543
When did he start beating you?

660
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:39,501
Got anyone to help?

661
00:50:43,001 --> 00:50:44,126
Pitiful girl...

662
00:50:47,793 --> 00:50:49,376
Stay at a hospital for a few days.

663
00:50:49,876 --> 00:50:51,000
No, it's okay.

664
00:50:51,001 --> 00:50:52,126
Take it.

665
00:50:52,459 --> 00:50:53,959
I know how you feel.

666
00:50:54,459 --> 00:50:56,293
My dead husband was a beater too.

667
00:50:57,793 --> 00:51:02,043
When you need help, call me anytime, okay?

668
00:51:03,709 --> 00:51:04,809
Okay.

669
00:51:14,459 --> 00:51:16,334
Hey, open the door.

670
00:51:28,834 --> 00:51:29,934
What's wrong?

671
00:51:30,168 --> 00:51:32,334
What do you mean you'll go to the police?

672
00:51:32,959 --> 00:51:34,376
I can't sleep.

673
00:51:36,459 --> 00:51:37,918
I keep hearing things...

674
00:51:39,584 --> 00:51:43,543
I hear voice of the man
I killed in my ears.

675
00:51:43,793 --> 00:51:45,584
Don't say weird things.

676
00:51:45,626 --> 00:51:46,726
I'm serious!

677
00:51:50,334 --> 00:51:51,626
I'm going nuts!

678
00:51:53,418 --> 00:51:55,334
I'm really going insane!

679
00:52:02,834 --> 00:52:05,626
I can't stand this,
I should turn myself in

680
00:52:08,501 --> 00:52:10,501
Do you think it only concerns yourself?

681
00:52:11,168 --> 00:52:13,918
I won't tell anything about you,
don't worry

682
00:52:17,918 --> 00:52:20,709
I think that man's soul
is possessing me...

683
00:52:21,084 --> 00:52:22,667
I can't live like this...

684
00:52:22,668 --> 00:52:26,209
Jin-tae, how about this?

685
00:52:27,084 --> 00:52:30,751
Let's hold a memorial
service for the dead man.

686
00:52:31,418 --> 00:52:32,959
A memorial service?

687
00:52:33,751 --> 00:52:36,918
Since he died begrudgingly,

688
00:52:37,126 --> 00:52:38,918
we'll bless him.

689
00:52:39,709 --> 00:52:42,918
Then maybe he won't bother you anymore.

690
00:52:45,584 --> 00:52:49,501
So? Feeling better?

691
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:54,542
Yeah, I think I'm better.

692
00:52:54,543 --> 00:52:58,126
Really? Are you really okay?

693
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:00,309
Yeah.

694
00:53:13,209 --> 00:53:14,876
Fucking moron...

695
00:53:19,376 --> 00:53:20,626
What is it now?

696
00:53:21,168 --> 00:53:22,626
I still hear him...

697
00:53:23,584 --> 00:53:25,501
What weak ass.

698
00:53:26,709 --> 00:53:28,500
Whose fault is it?

699
00:53:28,501 --> 00:53:30,638
It's because you asked
me to kill your husband!

700
00:53:31,084 --> 00:53:32,184
Me?

701
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,001
When did I?

702
00:53:34,334 --> 00:53:36,417
You insisted on killing him, no?

703
00:53:36,418 --> 00:53:38,833
Then you went and killed a random guy.

704
00:53:38,834 --> 00:53:42,126
I'm in a bigger mess because of you.

705
00:53:42,668 --> 00:53:44,959
So shut the hell up and get in the car!

706
00:53:48,418 --> 00:53:50,251
Where are you going?

707
00:53:50,793 --> 00:53:52,084
Police station.

708
00:53:52,168 --> 00:53:53,268
What?

709
00:53:57,126 --> 00:53:58,501
Jin-tae!

710
00:54:00,168 --> 00:54:03,168
I don't fucking believe this!

711
00:54:41,918 --> 00:54:43,709
Fucking moron!

712
00:54:51,209 --> 00:54:54,501
What do I do? What am I gonna do?

713
00:55:04,209 --> 00:55:08,751
"Boss"

714
00:55:20,626 --> 00:55:21,726
Miran?

715
00:55:24,501 --> 00:55:26,501
Aren't you working today?

716
00:55:53,043 --> 00:55:54,584
Did you bury the body properly?

717
00:55:56,959 --> 00:55:58,059
So?

718
00:56:00,084 --> 00:56:01,793
What do you want to do?

719
00:56:04,293 --> 00:56:05,709
I don't Know...

720
00:56:13,209 --> 00:56:17,751
No one will look for an illegal alien.

721
00:56:21,209 --> 00:56:22,751
Did you like him?

722
00:56:24,168 --> 00:56:25,293
No.

723
00:56:25,626 --> 00:56:27,292
That's fine, then.

724
00:56:27,293 --> 00:56:29,917
Even if it wasn't you,
he'd have died soon enough.

725
00:56:29,918 --> 00:56:31,334
It's already done.

726
00:56:36,959 --> 00:56:38,125
Follow me with the car.

727
00:56:38,126 --> 00:56:39,418
Where?

728
00:56:40,168 --> 00:56:41,751
Gotta get rid of it.

729
00:56:50,251 --> 00:56:51,615
Please take a good card of it.

730
00:57:07,626 --> 00:57:09,668
They'll get rid of the car.

731
00:57:12,793 --> 00:57:14,334
Let's get you washed up.

732
00:57:26,293 --> 00:57:28,084
Wanna hear something?

733
00:57:28,918 --> 00:57:31,543
There's a shark called sand tiger shark,

734
00:57:31,626 --> 00:57:34,543
it bears 50 or so eggs when it's pregnant.

735
00:57:35,834 --> 00:57:37,626
What's scary is that,

736
00:57:38,501 --> 00:57:42,084
the babies eat each other
in the mother's belly.

737
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:47,293
Only one will be born,
and it becomes a fierce predator.

738
00:57:50,293 --> 00:57:51,393
You know what?

739
00:57:52,959 --> 00:57:56,709
Autopsy rate for accidents
is only 4% in Korea.

740
00:57:58,043 --> 00:58:00,418
Autopsy wasn't done on my husband's body.

741
00:58:03,251 --> 00:58:04,626
Is your husband insured?

742
00:58:06,043 --> 00:58:07,143
Yes.

743
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:09,668
Think carefully.

744
00:58:11,376 --> 00:58:12,501
About what?

745
00:58:12,834 --> 00:58:14,126
Look at you.

746
00:58:14,668 --> 00:58:16,626
Aren't you seeing this through?

747
00:58:17,876 --> 00:58:20,334
Once is hard, twice is easy.

748
00:58:29,334 --> 00:58:32,168
What? You want one too?

749
00:58:39,459 --> 00:58:41,584
Do exactly as I tell you.

750
00:58:41,751 --> 00:58:43,626
There's no room for 2 mistakes.

751
00:58:44,251 --> 00:58:46,043
Come up with a solid alibi.

752
00:58:47,251 --> 00:58:51,376
Depression and over drinking
will be the causes of his death.

753
00:58:52,251 --> 00:58:55,251
There'll be fewer problems
when getting the monry.

754
00:58:56,751 --> 00:58:59,917
Say you found him when
you returned from work.

755
00:58:59,918 --> 00:59:03,168
My husband...
Could you send an ambulance right away?

756
00:59:03,209 --> 00:59:05,875
Your mind will go blank
and you'll be confused.

757
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:08,334
My address is...

758
00:59:11,584 --> 00:59:14,584
The police investigation will begin.

759
00:59:16,334 --> 00:59:19,709
Don't forget that
the husband you loved died so suddenly.

760
00:59:20,668 --> 00:59:22,334
He was...

761
00:59:24,293 --> 00:59:27,168
having a hard time because of the debt...

762
00:59:28,959 --> 00:59:31,334
But I told him we'd go
through this together...

763
00:59:33,376 --> 00:59:35,251
The investigation won't end in 1 session.

764
00:59:37,584 --> 00:59:39,251
Stay alert until the end.

765
00:59:44,793 --> 00:59:48,543
After the investigation,
make sure to cremate him.

766
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:51,001
So it won't cause trouble.

767
00:59:52,418 --> 00:59:53,584
Next page...

768
00:59:56,251 --> 01:00:00,709
Sign that and you'll get your big payout.

769
01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:07,001
And you'll be reborn.

770
01:00:31,959 --> 01:00:33,126
By the way...

771
01:00:33,251 --> 01:00:36,251
will I be okay leaving by myself tomorrow?

772
01:00:36,543 --> 01:00:39,043
I know someone at Pyeongtaek Lake.

773
01:00:39,126 --> 01:00:41,959
He knows you're getting on
the 8:30 boat to Chungdo.

774
01:00:42,709 --> 01:00:43,809
Okay...

775
01:00:44,209 --> 01:00:46,001
And this.

776
01:00:52,126 --> 01:00:54,168
I didn't help you for this.

777
01:00:58,709 --> 01:00:59,809
Here.

778
01:01:00,418 --> 01:01:01,709
What's this?

779
01:01:03,209 --> 01:01:04,834
The man your Chinese friend killed.

780
01:01:07,043 --> 01:01:11,418
He had a rape charge. Goddamn trash.

781
01:01:14,918 --> 01:01:16,376
Forget the past.

782
01:01:16,584 --> 01:01:18,834
You're restarting your life.

783
01:01:21,043 --> 01:01:23,834
Smile, you're allowed.

784
01:01:24,668 --> 01:01:25,834
It's all over.

785
01:01:56,793 --> 01:01:57,893
You're awake?

786
01:02:00,918 --> 01:02:02,876
I guess I didn't put enough sedative.

787
01:02:07,376 --> 01:02:09,251
I'm sorry for everything.

788
01:02:10,876 --> 01:02:12,626
Don't feel too bad.

789
01:02:13,001 --> 01:02:17,209
You killed 3 people after all.

790
01:02:26,126 --> 01:02:29,251
You can't trust anyone with a ton money.

791
01:02:29,459 --> 01:02:30,626
Not even your parents.

792
01:02:44,668 --> 01:02:49,084
"Chapter 5: Luck Strike"

793
01:02:50,251 --> 01:02:51,875
He came to your shop before dawn?

794
01:02:51,876 --> 01:02:54,251
Yeah, that cop you mentioned.

795
01:02:54,751 --> 01:02:57,334
He was being super grabby.

796
01:02:57,501 --> 01:03:00,001
I felt dirty watching that prick.

797
01:03:00,168 --> 01:03:02,625
The sucker was an excuse,

798
01:03:02,626 --> 01:03:03,793
he came to have fun.

799
01:03:03,959 --> 01:03:06,208
He definitely went there
to dig into my background.

800
01:03:06,209 --> 01:03:08,125
Of all the bars in town,

801
01:03:08,126 --> 01:03:09,833
why'd he go there?

802
01:03:09,834 --> 01:03:12,708
Anyway, he tried to convince
the girl to go fuck,

803
01:03:12,709 --> 01:03:15,418
but got rejected and went to a sauna.

804
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:17,293
And then?

805
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:18,584
I don't know.

806
01:03:19,793 --> 01:03:21,000
That sounded like a boast.

807
01:03:21,001 --> 01:03:23,168
I had something to do
and couldn't follow him.

808
01:03:23,418 --> 01:03:24,168
Carp!

809
01:03:24,169 --> 01:03:26,417
Don't you know what's important right now?

810
01:03:26,418 --> 01:03:29,292
I'm using my free time to help you out!

811
01:03:29,293 --> 01:03:31,375
If I'm not good enough, do it yourself!

812
01:03:31,376 --> 01:03:34,543
Come on, of course not!
You're doing amazing.

813
01:03:34,959 --> 01:03:37,333
Carp, just one more day.

814
01:03:37,334 --> 01:03:38,750
I'll give you 30%.

815
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:41,042
Bro, the cop's at the bar.

816
01:03:41,043 --> 01:03:41,918
What?

817
01:03:42,084 --> 01:03:43,543
I'll talk to you later.

818
01:03:43,751 --> 01:03:46,251
Hello? Carp? Dammit...

819
01:03:47,751 --> 01:03:50,501
Cop? For what?

820
01:03:51,418 --> 01:03:53,334
Frigging hell...

821
01:04:21,501 --> 01:04:22,601
Hey!

822
01:04:22,751 --> 01:04:24,876
Ow, that's hot, you're right on time.

823
01:04:25,709 --> 01:04:27,459
I made your favorite.

824
01:04:29,876 --> 01:04:31,125
Isn't the place clean?

825
01:04:31,126 --> 01:04:32,543
How could you!

826
01:04:33,334 --> 01:04:34,501
Because of you!

827
01:04:34,709 --> 01:04:37,834
Let's talk over dinner, okay?

828
01:04:46,918 --> 01:04:48,376
Sit.

829
01:04:58,918 --> 01:05:01,418
Did you not even feed yourself
while you were away?

830
01:05:02,959 --> 01:05:04,667
You look thin.

831
01:05:04,668 --> 01:05:06,759
You didn't eat properly
because I wasn't here?

832
01:05:09,168 --> 01:05:10,759
Are you even listening to yourself?

833
01:05:14,709 --> 01:05:16,334
I had a reason to be away.

834
01:05:17,251 --> 01:05:20,168
So tell me what that is!

835
01:05:20,959 --> 01:05:23,376
I know you had it tough because of me!

836
01:05:33,626 --> 01:05:35,083
I dabbled in different things

837
01:05:35,084 --> 01:05:37,251
but it wasn't so easy.

838
01:05:41,251 --> 01:05:43,209
So why are you back here?

839
01:05:46,584 --> 01:05:49,251
You're the only one I have.

840
01:05:54,543 --> 01:05:55,668
Jeez...

841
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:03,778
If you want me to go, I will.

842
01:06:07,126 --> 01:06:08,226
Eh?

843
01:06:09,626 --> 01:06:11,084
Are you serious?

844
01:06:12,751 --> 01:06:13,851
Hey!

845
01:06:19,251 --> 01:06:20,501
Don't go please!

846
01:06:32,959 --> 01:06:35,001
I've been thinking,

847
01:06:36,793 --> 01:06:39,209
I can't come out of this clean.

848
01:06:44,626 --> 01:06:46,793
I'm thinking of going
to my aunt's in Japan.

849
01:06:47,376 --> 01:06:49,584
I got some savings in the bank there.

850
01:06:50,709 --> 01:06:52,793
Ask her to send it right away.

851
01:06:52,834 --> 01:06:55,459
It's under my name,
I have to do it myself.

852
01:06:58,459 --> 01:07:00,626
I actually need your help.

853
01:07:02,876 --> 01:07:03,976
With what?

854
01:07:08,418 --> 01:07:10,584
I borrowed a friend's ID.

855
01:07:14,001 --> 01:07:16,411
Make sure there's no problem
when I leave the country.

856
01:07:28,001 --> 01:07:29,101
SEO Mi-ran?

857
01:07:30,334 --> 01:07:32,918
My new name, you like it?

858
01:07:37,334 --> 01:07:38,709
Are you...

859
01:07:39,876 --> 01:07:43,625
trying to change your identity
for the passport?

860
01:07:43,626 --> 01:07:46,084
Are you nuts? I just borrowed it.

861
01:07:50,501 --> 01:07:52,501
You came here for this.

862
01:08:01,459 --> 01:08:02,559
What?

863
01:08:04,084 --> 01:08:05,709
Do I still look like a sucker?

864
01:08:06,334 --> 01:08:08,016
Your tricks don't work on me anymore.

865
01:08:14,584 --> 01:08:15,918
Are you serious?

866
01:08:21,168 --> 01:08:22,268
Who's that?

867
01:08:27,751 --> 01:08:28,851
Who is it?

868
01:08:29,251 --> 01:08:30,584
It's me, YOO Myung-gu!

869
01:08:31,043 --> 01:08:32,168
That goddamn bastard!

870
01:08:32,543 --> 01:08:33,643
Who's YOO Myung-gu?

871
01:08:33,751 --> 01:08:36,833
It's this guy...

872
01:08:36,834 --> 01:08:38,208
He's a cop from Seoul.

873
01:08:38,209 --> 01:08:38,751
What?!

874
01:08:38,793 --> 01:08:40,209
I'll take care of it,

875
01:08:40,918 --> 01:08:42,959
stay here quietly, okay?

876
01:08:43,709 --> 01:08:46,876
Stupid snake, why is he here?

877
01:08:48,876 --> 01:08:51,168
What brings you...

878
01:08:51,251 --> 01:08:56,209
I felt bad about not
even paying for the sushi...

879
01:08:56,334 --> 01:08:59,458
It's all right.

880
01:08:59,459 --> 01:09:01,542
I brought some stuff
that we can eat together.

881
01:09:01,543 --> 01:09:04,209
I was told you got off work early.

882
01:09:04,334 --> 01:09:08,126
I have a guest and my place is a mess...

883
01:09:08,418 --> 01:09:09,668
Guest?

884
01:09:11,876 --> 01:09:12,976
Girlfriend?

885
01:09:13,584 --> 01:09:14,684
Yes.

886
01:09:14,793 --> 01:09:16,334
You said you didn't have one.

887
01:09:17,418 --> 01:09:19,001
You got one since then?

888
01:09:19,251 --> 01:09:21,209
Back then...

889
01:09:21,251 --> 01:09:23,084
Ow, my bladder...

890
01:09:23,668 --> 01:09:25,333
I had some beer earlier,

891
01:09:25,334 --> 01:09:26,958
I really gotta pee, one sec.

892
01:09:26,959 --> 01:09:28,959
There's public washroom...

893
01:09:29,501 --> 01:09:31,834
I gotta pee...

894
01:09:35,501 --> 01:09:36,601
Good evening.

895
01:09:38,209 --> 01:09:41,334
Eh? She's a hottie!

896
01:09:45,084 --> 01:09:46,184
Washroom's there.

897
01:09:46,543 --> 01:09:50,834
"Clouds gather in the blue sky,"

898
01:09:50,918 --> 01:09:55,293
"be the light of Pyeongtaek!"

899
01:09:55,376 --> 01:10:02,543
"Spread all over the world!"

900
01:10:04,876 --> 01:10:07,584
The school anthem is really good.

901
01:10:08,168 --> 01:10:09,334
Of course!

902
01:10:09,418 --> 01:10:11,959
The best high school
in Greater Pyeongtaek Area.

903
01:10:12,001 --> 01:10:13,876
- Right.
- Let's drink.

904
01:10:15,751 --> 01:10:16,851
Cheers.

905
01:10:21,459 --> 01:10:24,334
He told me he didn't have a girlfriend.

906
01:10:24,751 --> 01:10:26,668
You really said that? That makes me sad.

907
01:10:26,918 --> 01:10:28,250
Well, back then...

908
01:10:28,251 --> 01:10:31,625
But I'd hide a hottie

909
01:10:31,626 --> 01:10:33,834
like you too.

910
01:10:36,418 --> 01:10:37,518
Not gonna answer?

911
01:10:38,959 --> 01:10:40,059
"Carp"

912
01:10:42,626 --> 01:10:43,459
You should answer.

913
01:10:43,709 --> 01:10:44,809
It's not important.

914
01:10:47,626 --> 01:10:50,709
Oh, Dong-pal,

915
01:10:52,084 --> 01:10:53,751
have you found him yet?

916
01:10:56,293 --> 01:10:57,393
You know what?

917
01:10:58,043 --> 01:11:00,293
Body parts were found
in Pyeongtaek Lake today.

918
01:11:01,001 --> 01:11:02,101
Body parts?

919
01:11:02,543 --> 01:11:05,293
I thought it could be
him, so I checked it out,

920
01:11:05,334 --> 01:11:06,434
but it wasn't.

921
01:11:07,084 --> 01:11:09,376
The body had a woman's figure.

922
01:11:11,793 --> 01:11:12,959
That's horrible.

923
01:11:14,168 --> 01:11:16,334
It's a bit weird though.

924
01:11:18,418 --> 01:11:22,751
There's a shark tattoo,
as if for us to see.

925
01:11:25,418 --> 01:11:26,876
What's wrong?

926
01:11:26,959 --> 01:11:28,168
It's nothing.

927
01:11:31,293 --> 01:11:32,500
A shark tattoo?

928
01:11:32,501 --> 01:11:34,918
Yeah, you know something?

929
01:11:36,376 --> 01:11:38,834
I thought I had seen it, maybe I did.

930
01:11:38,876 --> 01:11:39,976
Yeah?

931
01:11:40,626 --> 01:11:43,584
I managed to get a pic from a cop friend.

932
01:11:45,168 --> 01:11:46,268
Wanna see?

933
01:11:48,126 --> 01:11:49,226
Check it out.

934
01:12:02,459 --> 01:12:03,559
It's not this one.

935
01:12:03,668 --> 01:12:05,001
The shark tattoo

936
01:12:05,168 --> 01:12:06,792
I know has different color and size.

937
01:12:06,793 --> 01:12:09,959
No more gruesome talks, let's just drink.

938
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:11,851
Cheers.

939
01:12:19,084 --> 01:12:20,184
Eh?

940
01:12:20,584 --> 01:12:22,376
It's from Seoul.

941
01:12:22,459 --> 01:12:23,559
Toilet break.

942
01:12:31,126 --> 01:12:33,543
Hello? Yeah!

943
01:12:35,001 --> 01:12:38,668
Don't... don't tell me you
actually killed someone!

944
01:12:38,793 --> 01:12:42,001
Are you nuts?
That tattoo is pretty common.

945
01:12:42,043 --> 01:12:43,834
Are you sure? Is it really him?

946
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:47,709
Should I tell that asshole that
you got the same tattoo?

947
01:12:53,751 --> 01:12:56,126
Go ahead. Do it.

948
01:12:57,209 --> 01:12:59,793
Oh man...

949
01:13:01,418 --> 01:13:03,876
Jeez...

950
01:13:08,043 --> 01:13:09,143
What's wrong?

951
01:13:10,584 --> 01:13:12,751
OH Dong-pal got arrested.

952
01:13:13,001 --> 01:13:13,626
What?

953
01:13:13,876 --> 01:13:17,668
He was caught in Gunsan
trying to smuggle out.

954
01:13:18,668 --> 01:13:22,418
In Gunsan?

955
01:13:22,918 --> 01:13:26,334
I'm screwed,
I gotta go back to Seoul with something.

956
01:13:27,543 --> 01:13:28,793
That's too bad.

957
01:13:29,084 --> 01:13:31,834
Worry about tomorrow, tomorrow.

958
01:13:37,959 --> 01:13:40,750
Drank it all, I'll get some more.

959
01:13:40,751 --> 01:13:44,209
No, sir! I can go.

960
01:13:44,751 --> 01:13:46,042
- Yeah?
- Yes.

961
01:13:46,043 --> 01:13:47,918
- Thank you, bud.
- Sure.

962
01:13:48,418 --> 01:13:49,918
I'll be right back.

963
01:13:50,501 --> 01:13:54,001
Where's my wallet... It's right here.

964
01:13:57,084 --> 01:13:59,084
- I'll be right back.
- Okay, see you.

965
01:14:05,834 --> 01:14:09,834
OH Dong-pal, you fucking moron...

966
01:14:13,001 --> 01:14:15,209
That fucking bitch...

967
01:14:17,459 --> 01:14:18,918
Why don't you ever answer?!

968
01:14:19,209 --> 01:14:19,918
What is it?

969
01:14:19,919 --> 01:14:22,001
The cops were here just now.

970
01:14:22,918 --> 01:14:25,209
I think CHOI Yeon-hee is dead.

971
01:14:25,334 --> 01:14:27,209
What? Oh my...

972
01:14:27,251 --> 01:14:29,418
They found a woman's body parts,

973
01:14:29,626 --> 01:14:31,626
it had a shark tattoo on her thigh.

974
01:14:31,668 --> 01:14:33,376
Is that so?

975
01:14:34,168 --> 01:14:35,376
Aren't you surprised?

976
01:14:36,043 --> 01:14:37,271
I thought you'd be shocked.

977
01:14:37,376 --> 01:14:41,334
I'm surprised. Surprised to death.

978
01:14:43,084 --> 01:14:44,501
What do we do now?

979
01:14:45,459 --> 01:14:47,833
Your debt is due tomorrow.

980
01:14:47,834 --> 01:14:49,333
CHOI's dead

981
01:14:49,334 --> 01:14:51,208
and the sucker's our last hope.

982
01:14:51,209 --> 01:14:52,584
Right, the sucker.

983
01:14:53,751 --> 01:14:55,333
He was caught in Gunsan.

984
01:14:55,334 --> 01:14:56,434
Gunsan?

985
01:14:58,209 --> 01:14:59,459
I knew it.

986
01:15:00,126 --> 01:15:01,945
Can you come over when I call you later?

987
01:15:02,293 --> 01:15:04,543
You want me to help you
flee the country now?

988
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:06,168
It's nothing like that.

989
01:15:06,251 --> 01:15:07,209
What is it then?

990
01:15:07,210 --> 01:15:09,084
Why, wanna spill everything to PARK?

991
01:15:09,709 --> 01:15:12,751
Come on, I couldn't help it.

992
01:15:13,251 --> 01:15:14,418
What is it?!

993
01:15:15,293 --> 01:15:18,918
Yeon-hee is at my place.

994
01:15:21,001 --> 01:15:21,709
What do you mean?

995
01:15:21,710 --> 01:15:23,376
I'll fill you in later,

996
01:15:24,626 --> 01:15:26,833
she's trying to flee,

997
01:15:26,834 --> 01:15:28,834
I think she has something.

998
01:15:29,001 --> 01:15:31,417
She wouldn't do anything empty-handed.

999
01:15:31,418 --> 01:15:32,251
Of course not.

1000
01:15:32,252 --> 01:15:33,542
But the problem is...

1001
01:15:33,543 --> 01:15:36,500
There's a problem?

1002
01:15:36,501 --> 01:15:38,501
The snake's at my place too.

1003
01:15:38,751 --> 01:15:39,851
The cop?

1004
01:15:40,834 --> 01:15:42,208
Having a housewarming party?

1005
01:15:42,209 --> 01:15:43,309
Shut up.

1006
01:15:43,876 --> 01:15:46,208
I'll send the snake away,

1007
01:15:46,209 --> 01:15:47,834
so help me fuck her up.

1008
01:15:49,084 --> 01:15:51,209
I'm not an errand boy...

1009
01:15:51,334 --> 01:15:53,459
We split her money, 60-40.

1010
01:15:54,876 --> 01:15:55,976
Who's the 60?

1011
01:15:56,084 --> 01:15:57,084
You're 40!

1012
01:15:57,168 --> 01:15:57,793

1013
01:15:57,794 --> 01:16:00,501
Forget it, I'll do it myself.

1014
01:16:00,626 --> 01:16:02,501
Okay, fine, fine!

1015
01:16:03,543 --> 01:16:04,643
Call me.

1016
01:16:08,793 --> 01:16:10,543
Stupid jackass.

1017
01:16:10,709 --> 01:16:12,833
Goddamn prick.

1018
01:16:12,834 --> 01:16:14,543
You better keep your word.

1019
01:16:27,376 --> 01:16:28,959
I'm back!

1020
01:16:39,709 --> 01:16:42,376
Are you just gonna watch? Come help me.

1021
01:16:56,543 --> 01:17:00,834
What did you... What the hell did you do?

1022
01:17:01,584 --> 01:17:04,793
As soon as you left, he touched my leg.

1023
01:17:05,334 --> 01:17:07,626
I was scared that he'd see my tattoo.

1024
01:17:09,834 --> 01:17:11,334
I, uh...

1025
01:17:12,376 --> 01:17:16,001
I'm gonna report you.

1026
01:17:20,293 --> 01:17:24,334
Think before you speak, this is your home.

1027
01:17:24,668 --> 01:17:26,500
Do you think the police will believe you?

1028
01:17:26,501 --> 01:17:29,001
But... why...

1029
01:17:29,668 --> 01:17:31,584
There's still time till morning,

1030
01:17:32,126 --> 01:17:34,459
We can bury the body, and leave together.

1031
01:17:34,584 --> 01:17:36,043
Let's start over.

1032
01:17:38,668 --> 01:17:40,084
Please get rid of him.

1033
01:17:46,876 --> 01:17:48,959
What weak ass.

1034
01:17:57,293 --> 01:17:58,418
Shit...

1035
01:18:04,876 --> 01:18:06,251
Crazy bitch.

"Pyeongtaek Lake Body Mystery"

1037
01:18:34,209 --> 01:18:35,959
I'm all ready!

1038
01:19:05,459 --> 01:19:06,709
Where.

1039
01:20:00,751 --> 01:20:03,376
Boss. She's awake.

1040
01:20:07,668 --> 01:20:09,251
Long time no see, Yeon-hee.

1041
01:20:11,293 --> 01:20:14,209
You showed up out of nowhere.

1042
01:20:14,543 --> 01:20:16,126
Did you have some fun?

1043
01:20:17,251 --> 01:20:19,376
You even chopped up a cop. so scary.

1044
01:20:20,584 --> 01:20:23,876
Boy, you got a knife too, right?

1045
01:20:24,918 --> 01:20:26,293
Wait, Mr. PARK.

1046
01:20:28,251 --> 01:20:29,626
I'll pay you...

1047
01:20:31,084 --> 01:20:33,251
I have money, I swear.

1048
01:20:33,668 --> 01:20:34,768
Where?

1049
01:20:36,209 --> 01:20:37,334
Where's the money?

1050
01:20:49,293 --> 01:20:50,709
Dammit...

1051
01:20:52,168 --> 01:20:54,918
You lead a tough life.

1052
01:21:00,709 --> 01:21:03,543
Something wrong?

1053
01:21:04,334 --> 01:21:06,126
He took my money.

1054
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:09,626
You expect me to believe that?

1055
01:21:10,668 --> 01:21:13,459
I won't fall for that again.

1056
01:21:26,543 --> 01:21:27,751
Who the hell?

1057
01:21:31,751 --> 01:21:32,959
Hello?

1058
01:21:33,709 --> 01:21:34,809
It's me.

1059
01:21:34,834 --> 01:21:36,626
Oh hey, are you awake?

1060
01:21:37,626 --> 01:21:39,667
What was it like to get hit in the head?

1061
01:21:39,668 --> 01:21:41,751
Did you see stars?

1062
01:21:43,001 --> 01:21:44,101
Where are you?

1063
01:21:44,543 --> 01:21:47,584
That's none of your business.

1064
01:21:48,418 --> 01:21:51,584
I found your Japanese bank in your trunk.

1065
01:21:56,084 --> 01:21:57,459
Don't touch my money.

1066
01:21:58,168 --> 01:22:00,918
Consider this as my cut for
putting up with your shit.

1067
01:22:01,168 --> 01:22:03,626
Have a great life!

1068
01:22:12,334 --> 01:22:13,793
He'll take the first boat.

1069
01:22:14,376 --> 01:22:16,331
If you search it the port,
you'll find him.

1070
01:22:17,834 --> 01:22:19,668
Son of a bitch...

1071
01:22:22,084 --> 01:22:24,543
If we don't find him before sunrise,

1072
01:22:25,793 --> 01:22:28,293
we'll have a gutting ceremony.

1073
01:23:01,959 --> 01:23:03,059
Welcome.

1074
01:23:03,376 --> 01:23:05,793
Put your shoes in the locker.

1075
01:23:06,709 --> 01:23:07,982
What time are you open till?

1076
01:23:08,084 --> 01:23:09,709
5AM, sir.

1077
01:23:11,084 --> 01:23:12,584
It's not 24 hours?

1078
01:23:12,918 --> 01:23:15,918
We have to close up to get ready to open.

1079
01:23:18,626 --> 01:23:20,042
Is there's a smoking area?

1080
01:23:20,043 --> 01:23:22,793
Yes, it's by the washroom there.

1081
01:23:41,793 --> 01:23:43,001
Damn...

1082
01:23:45,418 --> 01:23:46,751
Do you sell smokes here?

1083
01:23:47,376 --> 01:23:49,751
We don't...

1084
01:23:51,876 --> 01:23:57,293
Could you buy me a pack? Lucky Strike.

1085
01:23:57,834 --> 01:23:58,934
What?

1086
01:23:59,501 --> 01:24:00,918
Please? Just 1 pack.

1087
01:24:01,793 --> 01:24:04,459
Sorry, I'm the only one here,

1088
01:24:04,668 --> 01:24:06,709
I can't do that.

1089
01:24:06,751 --> 01:24:08,709
There's no one here,

1090
01:24:08,834 --> 01:24:09,959
I'll watch the shop.

1091
01:24:11,251 --> 01:24:14,084
I'm sorry, that's the policy.

1092
01:24:15,126 --> 01:24:16,226
I'm sorry.

1093
01:24:17,584 --> 01:24:22,376
Screw policy...
You don't know how to bend the rules?

Thank you.

1095
01:25:25,334 --> 01:25:26,434
What is it?

1096
01:25:27,084 --> 01:25:29,209
I'll pay it back! I got money.

1097
01:25:29,751 --> 01:25:31,626
Money... I have the money...

1098

You son of a bitch!

1102
01:25:45,668 --> 01:25:47,251
I'll pay it back!

1103
01:26:13,376 --> 01:26:16,334
Holy fuck....

1108
01:26:51,834 --> 01:26:54,459
You got fired, I gotta work.

You can quit.

What?

1112
01:27:07,084 --> 01:27:11,418
Why don't we open a shop again?

1113
01:27:11,501 --> 01:27:13,084
What do you mean? You got money?

1114

Money...

1115
01:27:20,001 --> 01:27:21,101
I think I do.

Stop saying nonsense and go home.

I'm calling about your remaining salary.

I don't care about that.

1123

I care, that's why I called.

Some people use this
to stir trouble later.

Have you seen this man?

1138
01:29:19,709 --> 01:29:21,084
I don't really know...

1139
01:29:22,626 --> 01:29:24,959
People come in and out all the time.

1140
01:29:27,293 --> 01:29:29,001
He probably came with this bag.

1141
01:29:31,459 --> 01:29:33,793
That's the bag you took home, right?

1142
01:29:35,668 --> 01:29:36,959
Yeah, I guess so.

1143
01:29:38,209 --> 01:29:40,334
It's the same model as mine.

1144
01:29:41,501 --> 01:29:43,209
I talked to Yoon-ho,

1145
01:29:43,793 --> 01:29:46,501
he said a patron left this in a locker.

1146
01:29:48,126 --> 01:29:49,226
When was that?

1147
01:29:49,459 --> 01:29:51,834
He doesn't remember the exact date.

1148
01:29:52,459 --> 01:29:57,917
He said you wanted to leave
it in the storage.

1149
01:29:57,918 --> 01:29:59,501
It wasn't on the list.

1150
01:30:00,709 --> 01:30:02,959
He's absolutely wrong about that.

1151
01:30:04,043 --> 01:30:05,709
He definitely saw you.

1152
01:30:14,209 --> 01:30:15,418
To be honest,

1153
01:30:16,334 --> 01:30:18,626
it's awkward to say this,

1154
01:30:20,209 --> 01:30:21,918
but I think it's Yoon-ho.

1155
01:30:23,001 --> 01:30:24,101
What?

1156
01:30:24,376 --> 01:30:26,876
Remember the drinks going missing?

1157
01:30:27,668 --> 01:30:29,293
He stole all those.

1158
01:30:30,084 --> 01:30:32,668
He's got sticky fingers.

1159
01:30:33,459 --> 01:30:34,708
I told him several times.

1160
01:30:34,709 --> 01:30:36,918
I've had it!

1161
01:30:38,293 --> 01:30:39,668
You took this bag.

1162
01:30:41,001 --> 01:30:42,959
It really is mine!

1163
01:30:44,876 --> 01:30:47,126
I'm sure of it,
I'm good at catching these.

1164
01:30:47,293 --> 01:30:50,626
I caught you red-handed.

1165
01:30:52,834 --> 01:30:58,584
My wife gave it to me for my birthday.

1166
01:30:59,043 --> 01:31:02,126
I'm serious. It's the truth.

1167
01:31:07,168 --> 01:31:08,918
All right,

1168
01:31:10,751 --> 01:31:13,293

Wait, wait. Are you leaving?

1170
01:31:15,626 --> 01:31:17,334
Aren't you going to check?

1171
01:31:17,668 --> 01:31:21,918
Yeah, well,
if you have more info then call me.

1172
01:31:25,418 --> 01:31:26,543
What the...

1173
01:31:41,459 --> 01:31:43,418
Must I really do this?

1174
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:49,125
In any case if something goes wrong,

1175
01:31:49,126 --> 01:31:52,209

1180
01:32:42,876 --> 01:32:45,918
What's going on here? Did you steal it?

1181
01:32:47,376 --> 01:32:48,476
I'm really sorry.

1182
01:32:49,001 --> 01:32:51,334
Give me your bank info,
and I'll send it to you.

1183
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:52,709
That's enough.

1184
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:57,917
I knew it, didn't I tell you?

1185
01:32:57,918 --> 01:33:01,208
I told you that woman
was going to kill us all.

1186
01:33:01,209 --> 01:33:02,333
She sent them, right?

1187
01:33:02,334 --> 01:33:04,250
Of course not, mom!

1188
01:33:04,251 --> 01:33:05,417
Of course it is!

1189
01:33:05,418 --> 01:33:07,458
Then why are these people here?

1190
01:33:07,459 --> 01:33:08,583
He's a detective!

1191
01:33:08,584 --> 01:33:10,708
And she came to find her
bag, get out of here.

1192
01:33:10,709 --> 01:33:12,084
You're a cop?

1193
01:33:12,293 --> 01:33:13,393
Yes.

1194
01:33:13,793 --> 01:33:16,793
Do detectives have tattoos
on their hands nowadays?

1195
01:33:20,168 --> 01:33:22,751
You idiot! He's not a cop!

1196
01:33:27,543 --> 01:33:29,875
Sorry, my mom has dementia.

1197
01:33:29,876 --> 01:33:31,042
Mom, please go outside.

1198
01:33:31,043 --> 01:33:32,500
Where are you going?! Leave that!

1199
01:33:32,501 --> 01:33:34,417
- Stop!
- Don't do that!

1200
01:33:34,418 --> 01:33:36,125
Let go!

1201
01:33:36,126 --> 01:33:37,375
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1202
01:33:37,376 --> 01:33:38,709
Let me go!

1203
01:33:39,584 --> 01:33:40,959
Mom, are you okay?

1204
01:33:41,334 --> 01:33:43,043
How could you...

1205
01:33:48,459 --> 01:33:50,668
Joong-man, hey!

1206
01:33:52,668 --> 01:33:55,543
They're so damn yappy.

1207
01:33:55,584 --> 01:33:57,418
Why did she have to get involved?

1208
01:33:57,459 --> 01:34:02,084
Ow, that stings... What's that?

1209
01:34:12,043 --> 01:34:15,501
You fucking bitch...

1210
01:34:26,918 --> 01:34:28,251
This money is mine.

1211
01:36:11,126 --> 01:36:13,251
Mom! Mom!

1212
01:36:16,376 --> 01:36:19,042
Fire! Fire!

1213
01:36:19,043 --> 01:36:22,876
Mom! Wake up! Mom!

1214
01:37:12,043 --> 01:37:14,626
A grown man shouldn't cry.

1215
01:37:16,418 --> 01:37:20,918
During the Korean War,
the whole country was like this.

1216
01:37:23,001 --> 01:37:27,168
If you're alive, things will work out.

1217
01:37:28,709 --> 01:37:34,043
With 2 arms and 2 legs,
you can start over.

1218
01:37:56,126 --> 01:37:58,459
Go to the boarding gate in 30 minutes.

1219
01:38:18,543 --> 01:38:21,043
Qi-nan, did you miss me?

1220
01:38:21,543 --> 01:38:23,293
Did you really miss me?

1221
01:38:24,251 --> 01:38:26,959
I think you just want to know
what makeup I brought you

1222
01:38:27,043 --> 01:38:28,168
Oh, okay.

1223
01:38:31,001 --> 01:38:32,729
If you want to know what the makeup is

1224
01:38:34,084 --> 01:38:36,876
I'll send you the video

1225
01:38:38,418 --> 01:38:46,668
Here in Korea, they like Sulwhasoo

1226
01:38:46,709 --> 01:38:47,809
I'll give you the money.

1227
01:38:48,584 --> 01:38:49,684
Everything.

1228
01:39:10,293 --> 01:39:13,293
I also bought your kid's toy
and your husband's ginseng

1229
01:39:14,959 --> 01:39:17,687
I bought you so many good things,
what will I get for return?

1230
01:39:18,793 --> 01:39:22,084
Maybe a nice dinner? Okay, deal!

1231
01:39:53,001 --> 01:39:57,293
You ugly piece of...

1232
01:40:28,251 --> 01:40:29,583
A woman in her 40s

1233
01:40:29,584 --> 01:40:32,168
was stabbed to death yesterday around 9 PM

1234
01:40:32,418 --> 01:40:36,126
in a Pyeongtaek Port washroom.

1235
01:40:36,293 --> 01:40:40,583
The police are pointing to a man
captured on security camera

1236
01:40:40,584 --> 01:40:41,834
as the prime suspect.

1237
01:40:42,334 --> 01:40:43,792
These are today's highlights

1238
01:40:43,793 --> 01:40:47,542
A Seoul detective
who was chasing after a suspect

1239
01:40:47,543 --> 01:40:50,751
was found dead in a Pyeongtaek apartment.

1240
01:40:51,001 --> 01:40:54,958
Although the home owner
announced as the suspect.

1241
01:40:54,959 --> 01:40:59,959
he was killed in a traffic accident,
putting this case in a turmoil.
