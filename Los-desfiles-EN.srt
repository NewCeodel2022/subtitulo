1
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:42,500
Ay, no. Ryo. Ryo. Ryo! Ryo! Ryo!

2
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:09,042
-Help me! -Keep looking. There is a lot of debris.

3
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,208
I'll leave the rest to you.

4
00:03:16,292 --> 00:03:18,292
Yeah.

5
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:24,250
-Maybe there are still people under the rubble -Excuse me! I can't find my

6
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:34,250
-son! Where are the rescued people? -Is anyone trapped here?

7
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,042
Ryo… ¡ Ryo!

8
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:26,667
Brother! It's good that you're okay.

9
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,042
Hey, Yuko, are you okay?

10
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,625
-I'll bring blankets. -Yeah.

11
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:43,375
Brother. Hey, haven't you seen my son? Sorry!

12
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,458
What's going on?

13
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,875
Aid. Please…

14
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:10,292
This place is dangerous.

15
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,375
Someone is coming.

16
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,625
-Wait. -Hey. Are you okay?

17
00:06:49,417 --> 00:06:51,000
Lucky.

18
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:55,292
I woke up, stranded alone on the beach...

19
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:59,250
No one responded to my voice and I couldn't feel any physical contact either. I felt

20
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:03,167
totally lost until you talked to me and...

21
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:07,167
Well, I know. I understand you. First, you have to calm down first. Breathe

22
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,250
war.

23
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:22,125
What happened… was shocking, right?

24
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:31,083
For now... Why don't you stay at our house? Hey, can you walk?

25
00:07:32,542 --> 00:07:34,542
Yeah.

26
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,208
Ven.

27
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,917
And just like I told you, see? I came up with the idea of ​​this sand

28
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,458
star. Okay? You've probably seen these in souvenir shops.

29
00:08:39,542 --> 00:08:42,542
I bought them for my family on my business trips.

30
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:46,250
I knew it. Yes. Well, that was my idea.

31
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,167
Here we go again.

32
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:52,708
I'm telling the truth, okay? She participated in student marches.

33
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:57,333
Then I ran out of money and had to flee to Iriomote Island.

34
00:08:57,417 --> 00:09:03,042
And it occurred to you to sell sand in bottles. I've heard it a hundred times.

35
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:08,125
Hey. Do we have a new guest?

36
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:22,917
An earthquake. Do you feel it?

37
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:25,917
I think so.

38
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Hello greetings! Hello Hello hello HELLO! Yes, it must have been difficult for you. I mean... It was

39
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:46,958
-a strong situation. -Michael, already…

40
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,917
What is this place?

41
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:59,833
Well... It's kind of hard to explain...

42
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:05,000
No problem. Calm down, friend. There's plenty of time to explain, yes? Kaori, give him the

43
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,667
-tour. -Yeah.

44
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:14,542
Hello! Kaori here. Good. Here.

45
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:20,292
It's just... Wait a minute. What…what is all this?

46
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,750
I won't tell him anything.

47
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:37,250
You see... It's a place... where people with issues in life meet. Well, no

48
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:45,083
only here. There are more places like this throughout the country and…

49
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,792
As? Which earrings?

50
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,292
Hey, Akira, you're not going to understand with so much detour.

51
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,250
Then you explain it to him, Shori.

52
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,917
Bluntly. You're already dead, you just… you still have unfinished business, so

53
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,292
you still can't go to the "other side."

54
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,042
I'm dead?

55
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:32,500
-I died? I died? -Well, well, well, well. Go to

56
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:50,958
rest a little, okay? We have good alcohol.

57
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:04,917
I dont need.

58
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:11,083
Maybe... come with me, okay? Peaceful.

59
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,000
It must... be because of a man.

60
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,625
I think so.

61
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:25,833
-Oh really? But she looks very old. -Sure, that must be it.

62
00:12:25,917 --> 00:12:26,958
Hang on a minute.

63
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,583
Here.

64
00:12:50,292 --> 00:12:56,542
The previous guest... has already left. You can use her room.

65
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:07,583
I know it's hard to process everything you just heard. You must try to

66
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:09,125
rest.

67
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:17,875
Are you also... in the same situation?

68
00:13:22,292 --> 00:13:29,208
That's how it is. We are your tutors. We have experience. Have a good night.

69
00:14:18,042 --> 00:14:22,083
Look, here's your baby. Congratulations.

70
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,792
Why don't you understand me, what the hell is wrong with you?

71
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,375
Well, I just…

72
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,958
That is what you want! I told you I don't need it!

73
00:14:31,042 --> 00:14:33,042
Understand…

74
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:33,708
Pretty boy.

75
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:34,958
Ryo, come here.

76
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:37,542
-It was close. -Happy birthday to you…

77
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,958
-Congratulations! -Look.

78
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,375
Move on.

79
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:46,042
-Look what you did! -Mommy, look at this.

80
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,125
Ya basta.

81
00:14:50,417 --> 00:14:52,500
-Hey, you have to go. -But I do not want!

82
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,667
Because? I have to go to work now. Hey.

83
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,292
I do not want to go to school!

84
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,875
Mommy, wake up!

85
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:04,208
-Mother! -Ryo!

86
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,333
-Hello. -Good morning!

87
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:26,917
-Good morning. -Likewise.

88
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,792
-Hello. Hello, hello everyone. -Good morning.

89
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,833
-Good morning. -Good morning.

90
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:36,417
Good morning. Kaori, can you get me some coffee?

91
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,708
-Clear. Here. -Thank you.

92
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,458
What are you doing?

93
00:15:50,542 --> 00:15:52,542
Yoga.

94
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,625
Do the dead do yoga? Why are we concerned about health?

95
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,792
Do not be bothering me.

96
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,542
Yoga. Yoga. I was the one who brought him to Japan. Did you know that?

97
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,375
Do not start.

98
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:04,625
-Of course... -It's serious. That's how

99
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:08,250
-I hurt my back. You see? -Hello. Good morning.

100
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:17,250
Miss. Good morning. You look pretty in the morning. What is your name?

101
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,208
Soy Minako Kawakami.

102
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:27,000
Minako. Wow, wow. You're very beautiful.

103
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:30,875
Hey, Michael, in these times, saying that is inappropriate.

104
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:33,042
That? Oh really? Because?

105
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:37,000
The old man sitting here is Michael.

106
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:40,708
And the man who brought you to this place is Akira. And the young man who is on that side is

107
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,792
Shori.

108
00:16:45,042 --> 00:16:49,250
He was a member of the Yakuza. That… is Mr. Tanaka, who was a banker. and I worked

109
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:52,708
in a bar Kaori here!

110
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,583
accompany us

111
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,333
Understand…

STOCK MARKET BURRS ECONOMIC BUBBLE

113
00:17:07,542 --> 00:17:08,708
This is…

114
00:17:09,917 --> 00:17:12,458
An old habit. Just that.

115
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:20,417
Hey, can I borrow your car key?

116
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,208
Clear.

117
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,833
That woman is kind of rude.

118
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:43,083
Hey! Is anyone trapped here!? Hello!?

119
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
¡Chinatsu!

120

You too.

129
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:41,708
I was separated from my family. I've been calling out your names daily to

130
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:47,458
find them. However, if they could hear my voice, it would mean that they are

131
00:18:47,542 --> 00:18:48,708
dead.

132
00:18:56,583 --> 00:19:02,625
I hope you can find yours.

133
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,792
Fortunately, the urban areas were less damaged, the highway acted

134
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:19,125
like breakwaters. We still have no news from Kawakami. Let's hope she's okay.

135
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:23,542
Rescue teams continue to search for the missing.

136
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:27,292
All we can do for now is work with the police and report the

137
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,708
news accurately. To work!

138
00:19:31,542 --> 00:19:33,542
Yeah!

139
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:41,458
Mr. Kanda, I'm right in front of you.

140
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:20,542
-Come on. -I do not want to do it.

141
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,417
-Hello. You come back. -Welcome.

142
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:31,000
-Yeah. Hey thanks a lot. -You are welcome.

143
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,083
How nice you are here. We're about to eat nabe. Want

144
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:35,042
accompany us?

145
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:38,958
I'm sorry. I'm not in the mood for that.

146
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:45,958
That's precisely why you should join us. Yeah? Okay.

147
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,958
Is…

148
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,417
Now it's autumn...

149
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:05,500
on this empty beach.

150
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:09,125
Even if…

151
00:21:12,542 --> 00:21:16,333
A singular dream appears...

152
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
He has sung it a thousand times.

153
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:26,292
Because I promised you the sand.

154
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:32,542
No matter how sad I feel...

155
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,792
I'm not going to die.

156
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:45,167
This is "Empty Beach." It is a good song. No, Shori?

157
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,292
Yes, not bad.

158
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:50,708
Good. Hey, Minako, do you want to sing?

159
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:52,000
No thank you very much.

160
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:55,292
You do not know? I teach you.

161
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:59,875
-Hey. Here you go. The nabe is ready! -Excellent!

162
00:22:03,292 --> 00:22:07,917
-Come. Hey Hey. Come here. -Wow.

163
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,542
-Wow! -Wow! It looks delicious!

164
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:19,792
-To eat. Smells good. -Eat meat. To have power. Hey Hey.

165
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:22,375
Toma, Kaori. Ten.

166
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,333
-Eat, eat. -Thanks for the food.

167
00:22:24,417 --> 00:22:26,750
Thank you so much!

168
00:22:28,042 --> 00:22:31,625
-I feel it in my bones. -Excuse me…

169
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:40,750
Does everyone have… pending in the world of the living?

170
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:47,333
It's just that, well... everyone has pending things.

171
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:51,583
And that's why they spend all day lazing around?

172
00:22:52,417 --> 00:22:57,000
-Well, you say "lazing around", but... What? -Well, I guess this

173
00:22:57,083 --> 00:23:00,292
It seems to you to be lazy.

174
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:07,583
Well, I'm sorry to say this... But I can't waste my time like this.

175
00:23:16,292 --> 00:23:17,958
Minako, wait.

176
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:26,500
Even one day... Why don't you hang out with us?

177
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,958
And why would I do it?

178
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:37,083
Because we... maybe we could help you.

179
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:44,583
Yes. That's just what I was going to say, right? Yeah.

180
00:23:44,667 --> 00:23:47,000
Yes, surely.

181
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:52,583
It's time! Quick, finish eating! Fast!

182
00:23:54,792 --> 00:23:58,667
-I want a little more. Please. -Hurry up.

183
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:02,458
Clear.

184
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,708
-Thank you. -Yeah.

185
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:08,042
It's delicious.

186
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,917
-Hello Hello hello. -Hello.

187
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:09,167
-We can't start without doing this, right? -Start it?

188
00:25:09,833 --> 00:25:11,792
There is always a purification ritual before I make a

189
00:25:11,875 --> 00:25:13,167
movie.

190
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:16,875
He is a self-proclaimed film producer.

191
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:18,958
Look at my movies. You will be impressed by some of those works

192
00:25:19,042 --> 00:25:20,333
teachers.

193
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,542
They are all in the cinema over there. Yeah? Okay.

194
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:26,208
Okay, okay, let's go.

195
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:29,958
Good. Okay. Go Go.

196
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:28,000
Hey, what are you doing?

197
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:36,167
Once a month, on the full moon, we all get together and search...

198
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:40,250
That?

199
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,417
To the person that everyone wants to see.

200
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:51,208
It's very strange, right? I never imagined being with someone after death.

201
00:26:52,167 --> 00:26:54,333
Shori, try to make sense of a contradiction, in itself it is a

202
00:26:54,417 --> 00:26:56,500
-contradiction. -If there is little.

203
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:58,583
That?

204
00:26:58,708 --> 00:26:59,917
-It's true. -Come on.

205
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:13,375
Hey! Hey! I found them! Look. Here.

206
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:18,917
Chinatsu.

207
00:27:21,542 --> 00:27:23,542
Sky!

208
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:24,042
-Alive. -Dad.

209
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:26,125
Dad…

210
00:27:25,958 --> 00:27:27,958
Kazuki.

211
00:27:30,292 --> 00:27:31,750
I'm sorry.

212
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,583
It's strange, don't you think? We die, but we are still here.

213
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,167
It definitely means that we exist in this world.

214
00:27:44,917 --> 00:27:46,208
Yes, we exist…

215
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:51,375
I'm sorry. I couldn't protect them.

216
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:08,208
My back hurts. Hey, Kaori, can I have a beer?

217
00:28:08,292 --> 00:28:10,292
Okay.

218
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:14,208
-Here you have. -Thank you.

219
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:15,750
Do you think Minako wants one?

220
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:17,833
I'll give it to you.

221
00:28:17,625 --> 00:28:19,625
Thank you.

222
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:21,708
Ten.

223
00:28:25,167 --> 00:28:26,417
What did you think, Minako?

224
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:35,458
I... Well... I'm surprised. And very confused.

225
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:39,750
Who wouldn't be?

226
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:43,417
Minako, who are you looking for? To your boyfriend? Surely. I hope you find it.

227
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,417
Hey, that's enough.

228
00:28:47,042 --> 00:28:49,042
Because?

229
00:28:48,667 --> 00:28:50,667
To my son.

230
00:28:50,792 --> 00:28:52,125
You see? I knew.

231
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:59,708
Turns out... I have a son, Ryo, who I raised alone. He is seven years old.

232
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:06,250
Knowing if he is alive or not... is my only concern.

233
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:21,792
Please allow me to be here a little longer.

234
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:32,292
Yes, it's cool. Of course. You will find it.

235
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:36,042
Good? Who talks like that?

236
00:29:38,667 --> 00:29:40,833
Yes, like that. Güeno.

237
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:50,417
Good. Come here. Let's toast. Come come. Yeah? Come. Let's toast. Yeah?

238
00:29:56,458 --> 00:29:58,458
Kaori, please.

239
00:29:58,667 --> 00:30:00,500
-Good. Health. -Health.

240
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:01,833
-Health. -Health.

241
00:30:01,917 --> 00:30:03,917
Health.

242
00:30:07,667 --> 00:30:09,417
THE PARADES

243
00:30:25,708 --> 00:30:26,917
Yes, it is open.

244
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:34,667
Happens.

245
00:30:42,792 --> 00:30:45,542
-What, what is all this? -These are the notes that I have

246
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:48,417
taken for a long time.

247
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:55,667
But… you know, I'm going to combine them all like a professional writer.

248
00:30:56,417 --> 00:30:58,417
Ahh…

249
00:30:59,917 --> 00:31:01,917
What's going on?

250
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:07,000
It's just that I wanted to thank you for asking me to stay. Now I feel a little

251
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:12,583
-better. -You are welcome. I know what you're going through.

252
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:16,792
Are you also looking for someone?

253
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:22,167
No. I'm not looking for anyone. I just… I want to take note of everything I see here.

254
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:26,333
I want there to be a record that such a world exists when our lives end.

255
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:28,417
lives.

256
00:31:34,875 --> 00:31:37,292
So, is that your unfinished business?

257
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:41,958
I'm not sure.

258
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:50,542
Do you need the car? You can use it whenever you want.

259
00:31:51,458 --> 00:31:52,750
I appreciate it a lot.

260
00:31:54,875 --> 00:32:00,417
I know you will find it. Peaceful. You could... take advantage of us and

261
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,292
ask us for more help.

262
00:32:13,792 --> 00:32:17,792
Minako, listen... I would like... to interview you one day. Please tell me a little about

263
00:32:17,875 --> 00:32:19,042
your life.

264
00:32:25,875 --> 00:32:27,042
Sure, of course.

265
00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:45,625
-Hello dear friend. -What's happening?

266
00:32:45,708 --> 00:32:48,458
How cool. How cool. You look good in those clothes, don't you?

267
00:32:48,542 --> 00:32:50,292
don't disturb

268
00:32:51,917 --> 00:32:55,750
Know? A while ago I made a Yakuza movie.

269
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:57,750
It was surely one of those typical poorly done ones.

270
00:32:57,833 --> 00:33:02,167
No not at all. It was a pretty good one! I'll show it to you someday.

271
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:06,750
Yes of course. See you later. See you.

272
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:22,292
JOBAN NUCLEAR REACTOR DAMAGED BY TSUNAMI

273
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:25,792
IF IT IS SLOWLY STABILIZING…

274
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,667
DECEASED

275
00:33:39,458 --> 00:33:41,458
I have it.

276
00:33:40,542 --> 00:33:43,458
They haven't found her yet. To Minako.

277
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:50,292
MINAKO KAWAKAMI MISSING

278
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:03,667
-Boss. Happy Birthday. -Thank you.

279
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:05,833
I will serve.

280
00:34:07,458 --> 00:34:09,625
Thank you so much.

281
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:11,500
Yes sir.

282
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:13,208
Drink up, guys. Health.

283
00:34:13,292 --> 00:34:15,292
-Thank you. -Thank you.

284
00:34:14,292 --> 00:34:16,042
-Thank my Lord. -Thank you.

285
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:17,875
Happy birthday, dad.

286
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:35,750
Coman.

287
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:38,292
-Thank you. -Thank you.

288
00:34:46,917 --> 00:34:48,250
I don't know how to act nobly,

289
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:50,333
But you don't need to do it to understand

290
00:34:50,417 --> 00:34:54,292
That three people's problems are nothing in this crazy world.

291
00:34:55,167 --> 00:34:57,167
One day you will understand.

292
00:34:58,792 --> 00:35:00,792
C'mon C'mon.

293
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:04,333
Everything will be okay, baby.

294
00:35:15,167 --> 00:35:16,542
Everything is in order.

295
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:18,000
Everything except one thing.

296
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:21,000
WHAT IS THE BEYOND?

297
00:35:24,667 --> 00:35:27,042
-I'm back. -Ah hello!

298
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,000
Kaori, a beer.

299
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:31,083
Of course.

300
00:35:34,542 --> 00:35:36,125
-Here I leave it for you. -Thank you.

301
00:35:38,417 --> 00:35:41,667
What do you have, Shori? You look a little sad.

302
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,208
Oh really?

303
00:35:44,792 --> 00:35:48,208
Today is your dad's birthday, right? How is he?

304
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:54,833
Well… It looks very good. But he is already getting old.

305
00:35:55,417 --> 00:36:00,292
I imagine. It's been seven years since you came here, hasn't it, Shori?

306
00:36:01,042 --> 00:36:07,208
Sometimes I wonder... how different it would be if I had stayed by his side.

307
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:15,958
Know? I made a Yakuza movie. But things have been very difficult for

308
00:36:16,042 --> 00:36:21,667
they. They are a symbol of society. Since society was divided, people

309
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:27,375
He no longer has human rights. Listen, next time you go to the movies, I'll give it to you.

310
00:36:27,458 --> 00:36:30,708
-I'll show you, okay? -Yes, whatever you say, whatever you say. Okay.

311
00:36:30,792 --> 00:36:32,792
Yeah.

312
00:36:36,375 --> 00:36:39,167
What is the matter you have pending, Shori?

313
00:36:40,417 --> 00:36:43,167
I didn't expect you to ask that.

314
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:45,417
But I already told you which one is mine.

315
00:36:46,667 --> 00:36:48,667
Well…

316
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:58,958
I ended up like this because of a Yakuza conflict seven years ago. I left my wife alone, and

317
00:36:59,042 --> 00:37:00,500
Come here.

318
00:37:06,042 --> 00:37:08,375
That? Were you married?

319
00:37:09,167 --> 00:37:13,875
Well, not exactly. At least not something official.

320
00:37:14,708 --> 00:37:20,750
-It's actually quite sensitive. -Hey, shut up!

321
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,458
And you've been looking for her for seven years?

322
00:37:29,167 --> 00:37:36,083
Well… I'm not sure. Maybe I don't want to see it. Even if she sees her, I won't be able to hug her.

323
00:37:49,792 --> 00:37:56,792
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF THE PENDING ISSUES ARE NOT RESOLVED?

324
00:38:43,417 --> 00:38:45,750
WHO HOSHISUNAZA

325
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,042
Good afternoon…

326
00:38:55,042 --> 00:38:56,875
So tell me…

327
00:39:00,167 --> 00:39:01,375
Is everyone safe?

328
00:39:04,667 --> 00:39:09,208
Yes. You have to wait. Yes bye.

329
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,333
Now it's summer...

330
00:39:23,792 --> 00:39:25,833
On this beach…

331
00:39:29,958 --> 00:39:32,833
Sasaki, Tamashiro was arrested.

332
00:39:32,917 --> 00:39:37,292
I see. The authorities act firmly. You are going to be next. So

333
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:41,167
Keep a low profile.

334
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:45,083
Understood.

335
00:39:45,792 --> 00:39:49,708
Tamashiro was also detained. Let that be in tomorrow's flyer.

336
00:39:49,792 --> 00:39:52,083
Yes. I'll have it ready later.

337
00:39:55,042 --> 00:39:59,583
Well, Maiko, see you tomorrow.

338
00:40:06,667 --> 00:40:10,042
Mr. Koga, are you okay?

339
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:15,875
Yeah, relax.

340
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:23,792
The other day, one of our members, Tamashiro, was unjustly arrested!

341
00:40:23,875 --> 00:40:28,125
We must never give in to such oppression by the authorities!

342
00:40:29,125 --> 00:40:30,750
-That's how it is! -That's how it is!

343
00:40:30,833 --> 00:40:33,250
It is time for the students, workers, and people of Okeyinawa to stand up!

344
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:35,750
Stand up to abolish the security treaty and take back Okeyinawa!

345
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:38,292
The university can no longer allow their illegal occupation. Remove the barricade and

346
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:40,542
-Leave immediately. -That's how it is!

347
00:40:41,958 --> 00:40:43,458
Raise your voice!

348
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:45,625
-Raise your voice! -Raise your voice!

349
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:47,750
¡Devuélvannos Okeyinawa!

350
00:40:47,833 --> 00:40:49,875
-¡Devuélvannos Okeyinawa! -¡Devuélvannos Okeyinawa!

351
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:51,958
End the Vietnam War!

352
00:40:52,042 --> 00:40:54,083
-End the Vietnam War! -End the Vietnam War!

353
00:40:54,167 --> 00:40:55,958
Remove the American bases!

354
00:40:56,042 --> 00:40:58,500
-Remove the American bases! -Remove the American bases!

355
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:00,125
Charge!

356
00:41:02,083 --> 00:41:03,167
Joined!

357
00:41:04,625 --> 00:41:05,708
Joined!

358
00:41:07,375 --> 00:41:08,417
Joined!

359
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,500
Joined!

360
00:41:13,833 --> 00:41:15,833
Whom!

361
00:41:39,125 --> 00:41:41,000
What time is it?

362
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:43,792
It's still midnight. You must lie down.

363
00:41:53,167 --> 00:41:56,667
Does it still hurt a lot?

364
00:42:58,625 --> 00:42:59,667
You scared me.

365
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:07,167
-Very sorry. It's me. -Minako, you scared me.

366
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:11,208
What is the name of the movie we were watching?

367
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:17,625
It's called "In Search of Lost Time." Great movie, isn't it?

368
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:21,458
Yes. Although it ended halfway.

369
00:43:21,542 --> 00:43:26,667
Yes. It turns out that the movie was left halfway because I died.

370
00:43:27,708 --> 00:43:31,500
-Ah, really? -It was going to be a big hit among

371
00:43:31,583 --> 00:43:35,375
young people and it was going to have a big impact on all of them, seriously.

372
00:43:35,458 --> 00:43:38,667
It would have been amazing.

373
00:43:41,042 --> 00:43:44,917
And the poster was going to be Maiko, the protagonist, alone on the beach. And up

374
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,542
bam! Title. Without a doubt it was going to be a great success.

375
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:52,375
You even had the poster ready.

376
00:43:52,458 --> 00:43:57,542
Yes of course. From start to finish, well, I already had everything planned. The theme, the

377
00:43:57,625 --> 00:44:01,708
history and everything at all.

378
00:44:02,792 --> 00:44:07,917
But why did you want to make a film about the student movement?

379
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:12,000
Oh, this one? Yes… This is a story about me.

380
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:14,417
¿Autobiographical?

381
00:44:15,875 --> 00:44:22,042
Not exactly, but… I participated in a student protest. Which was, well, without

382
00:44:22,125 --> 00:44:28,292
Regardless of whether it was correct or incorrect, the important thing was unity. The movie theater is

383
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:34,500
equal. Yes. All with the same objective, united. It's art.

384
00:44:35,125 --> 00:44:37,458
You really loved movies, didn't you?

385
00:44:40,667 --> 00:44:45,125
If it's an autobiography, does that mean Maiko was your girlfriend?

386
00:44:46,708 --> 00:44:52,125
-What are you saying? Well, I guess so. -And what happened to your relationship afterwards?

387
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:01,917
Well. Many things happened. But I wish she could have seen the movie.

388
00:45:14,333 --> 00:45:16,333
Maybe she's still waiting for her.

389
00:45:20,458 --> 00:45:23,375
No. I'm not sure.

390
00:45:30,792 --> 00:45:32,792
I'm here.

391
00:45:31,792 --> 00:45:35,167
Welcome! Hey, dinner's ready.

392
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,500
Yeah!

393
00:45:37,458 --> 00:45:38,833
Come on, Kenta. Your sister said dinner is ready.

394
00:45:38,917 --> 00:45:40,917
Tare!

395
00:45:43,333 --> 00:45:46,708
Hey, Kenta, put down your video game. Riko, give this to mom.

396
00:45:46,792 --> 00:45:48,667
Oh yeah. Okay.

397
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:53,958
Kent! Dinner is ready.

398
00:45:55,542 --> 00:45:57,542
Ten.

399
00:45:58,208 --> 00:45:59,292
How much do they want?

400
00:45:59,375 --> 00:46:00,417
The normal.

401
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,000
-And you, Kenta? -A lot.

402
00:46:02,083 --> 00:46:03,500
A lot? So?

403
00:46:03,583 --> 00:46:05,583
Thank you.

404
00:46:06,333 --> 00:46:10,375
-Don't choke, Kenta. -That's lovely.

405
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,833
Hey. And how is the team doing?

406
00:46:13,917 --> 00:46:16,250
-Second. -Good.

407
00:46:17,833 --> 00:46:19,208
Is it going to be your match?

408
00:46:19,667 --> 00:46:21,167
And? Will win?

409
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:22,750
It will be a piece of cake.

410
00:46:22,833 --> 00:46:25,667
-The other day they lost by beating. -Hey, don't say that! In

411
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:28,833
-Serious! What's wrong with you, Riko? -I saw that game too.

412
00:46:30,583 --> 00:46:32,583
Don't say that.

413
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:33,208
The baby kicked.

414
00:46:33,292 --> 00:46:34,792
-Oh really? -Yeah.

415
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:37,042
That? Wait wait. Do it again.

416
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:40,750
-Wow! -He kicked! Hey, Kenta, come on.

417
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:42,833
Isn't it true?

418
00:46:42,917 --> 00:46:44,958
-No, thanks. -Come closer and listen.

419
00:47:58,583 --> 00:48:01,833
I know it's old, but it can still be used.

420
00:48:02,625 --> 00:48:06,375
-Oh really? -Yes, look at it. Do not say no to me

421
00:48:06,458 --> 00:48:10,250
shines. Hello, Minako! Good morning.

422
00:48:10,333 --> 00:48:11,625
What are they doing?

423
00:48:11,708 --> 00:48:17,500
Well... I was very moved by your words yesterday.

424
00:48:17,583 --> 00:48:18,833
That? Which words?

425
00:48:18,917 --> 00:48:22,167
Be careful with what you say. I have plans for today.

426
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:24,000
Seriously, I don't know what you're talking about.

427
00:48:24,542 --> 00:48:28,375
Minako. You worked in television, right?

428
00:48:28,458 --> 00:48:30,542
I was just a journalist. Yeah.

429
00:48:30,625 --> 00:48:37,458
Just take this. Here. Listen. I decided… I'm going to finish the movie.

430
00:48:41,375 --> 00:48:45,250
-That? -Good. Friends. Listen. On television,

431
00:48:45,333 --> 00:48:49,208
shows come and go. Movies are eternal. I can not allow

432
00:48:49,292 --> 00:48:53,125
let them do this without desire. Yeah?

433
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:56,792
-And what are we supposed to do? -OK. Akira, you see yourself

434
00:48:56,875 --> 00:48:59,875
very slow, so hold this.

435
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,500
That? This is…?

436
00:49:01,583 --> 00:49:05,458
-Kaori. Kaori, you the audio. Good? -Try it. That? It's a great job.

437
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:09,417
-Tanaka. Tanaka, you will be my assistant. -Yeah? Yeah.

438
00:49:10,042 --> 00:49:11,667
And, well, Shori.

439
00:49:12,292 --> 00:49:14,958
You, you, you, you, you are attractive. So you will be my son. Here is the script.

440
00:49:15,042 --> 00:49:16,625
-Yeah? -Yeah?

441
00:49:18,292 --> 00:49:21,250
-Good. -Are you going to be the director?

442
00:49:22,792 --> 00:49:26,458
Director and protagonist. In the style of Yang Ik-joon.

443
00:49:27,042 --> 00:49:29,958
So, so what, what style is that?

444
00:49:30,042 --> 00:49:36,958
OK. Let's get started! Camera! Ready? Action!

445
00:49:45,958 --> 00:49:52,875
Since then... About fifty years have passed since then.

446
00:49:58,250 --> 00:49:59,292
Whats Next?

447
00:49:59,375 --> 00:50:01,542
He says "I want, I want to see her again. I want to go back, I want to see her again."

448
00:50:01,625 --> 00:50:04,083
That? That? I can't hear you.

449
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:06,208
I want to see her again.

450
00:50:06,292 --> 00:50:08,292
Cut!

451
00:50:07,333 --> 00:50:09,333
Wanna…

452
00:50:08,667 --> 00:50:10,667
Ready? Action!

453
00:50:18,125 --> 00:50:19,583
-What was that? -Well…

454
00:50:19,667 --> 00:50:21,667
Clear…

455
00:50:24,417 --> 00:50:26,542
Something got into the shot.

456
00:50:26,625 --> 00:50:28,875
That? I want to see her again.

457
00:50:29,583 --> 00:50:32,000
It's not about the lines! It's about the emotion.

458
00:50:32,083 --> 00:50:33,583
-I understand. Let's do it again. -Yeah.

459
00:50:33,667 --> 00:50:36,125
-I'm already in character! -Understood.

460
00:50:36,708 --> 00:50:40,083
The door doesn't open properly.

461
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:42,208
I want to see her again.

462
00:50:43,042 --> 00:50:45,042
I already know it.

463
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:46,917
Lots of shine!

464
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:47,375
How long should I wait?

465
00:50:48,125 --> 00:50:52,792
Just try to get into character! Watch me and get ready!

466
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:54,708
-Let's do another take. -Yes that's fine.

467
00:51:02,042 --> 00:51:05,375
When I first heard it, I wasn't sure...

468
00:51:05,458 --> 00:51:07,833
What's happening? Why are you turning it?

469
00:51:07,917 --> 00:51:09,917
No... it's nothing.

470
00:51:08,917 --> 00:51:09,958
It seems that…

471
00:51:10,042 --> 00:51:12,750
No, no, remember to start with "Since then." "Since then".

472
00:51:12,833 --> 00:51:15,208
No no no no. Good good good. It's the first day. We have not yet learned to

473
00:51:15,292 --> 00:51:17,875
teamwork.

474
00:51:17,958 --> 00:51:19,958
Is that why it went wrong?

475
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,333
Of course that's why. Cinema is a team effort. Or not?

476
00:51:24,917 --> 00:51:26,000
Why are you asking me?

477
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:32,083
Very good. Every department needs a meeting.

478
00:51:32,792 --> 00:51:36,417
Minako. I'm going to teach you how to use the camera. Hey, come on. Because?

479
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:40,292
-No, thanks. -Is that another guest?

480
00:51:43,208 --> 00:51:45,208
Yeah.

481
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:46,083
I will go to receive it.

482
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
It's very young.

483
00:51:50,458 --> 00:51:52,208
How are you?

484
00:51:58,083 --> 00:52:00,083
You see me?

485
00:52:01,458 --> 00:52:03,958
What's going on here?

486
00:52:06,917 --> 00:52:11,333
I am new too. Listen, why don't we go with them?

487
00:52:15,833 --> 00:52:17,833
What is your name?

488
00:52:20,792 --> 00:52:22,792
Nana.

489
00:52:26,833 --> 00:52:32,583
-Hello! How, how are you? Nice to meet you. -That?

490
00:52:33,167 --> 00:52:35,167
Nice to meet you.

491
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:54,667
I know. This is shocking. But I'm very sorry.

492
00:52:54,750 --> 00:53:00,292
I don't regret anything. I'm happy my life ended.

493
00:53:01,625 --> 00:53:05,250
Wow, we have an insidious girl in the house.

494
00:53:05,333 --> 00:53:06,792
Oh, what do you care?

495
00:53:08,292 --> 00:53:13,750
Okay. Miss, there is a place for you to rest. Come.

496
00:53:20,958 --> 00:53:24,208
That girl is… you know what, Tanaka.

497
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:29,750
-Yes I know. -Yeah. Well I go.

498
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,208
Shori…

499
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:34,542
That?

500
00:53:33,583 --> 00:53:36,125
Happy anniversary of your death.

501
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:37,875
Shut up.

502
00:54:08,667 --> 00:54:14,958
Sorry, Shori. I decided to disband the group.

503
00:54:28,208 --> 00:54:30,708
TOMB OF THE KATO

504
00:55:59,417 --> 00:56:02,750
HAPPY SECOND ANNIVERSARY

505
00:56:22,417 --> 00:56:24,333
THANK YOU FOR THE RIDES ON YOUR BEAUTIFUL MOTORCYCLE

506
00:56:24,417 --> 00:56:26,042
TOGETHER FOREVER LET'S TRAVEL A LOT

507
00:56:37,417 --> 00:56:39,417
I'm here!

508
00:56:40,708 --> 00:56:42,708
Welcome!

509
00:56:45,708 --> 00:56:47,708
You arrived early.

510
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:48,833
Yes. I sent you a message.

511
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,333
I didn't realize, sorry.

512
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:54,750
Curry lasts.

513
00:56:54,167 --> 00:56:55,333
Thank you.

514
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:06,208
Mizuki. Next week I will have a day off. Would you accompany me to visit my

515
00:57:06,292 --> 00:57:12,625
parents? I have not been able to present them officially.

516
00:57:15,083 --> 00:57:17,083
Clear.

517
00:57:17,208 --> 00:57:21,583
We also have to make decisions about our future.

518
00:57:24,083 --> 00:57:26,083
I know.

519
00:57:43,667 --> 00:57:50,583
So much has happened... But you haven't changed one bit.

520
00:58:03,833 --> 00:58:05,042
He seems like a good guy.

521
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:11,542
Although I am much prettier than him.

522
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,500
I'm sorry.

523
00:58:48,292 --> 00:58:49,417
Be happy.

524
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,333
Memories of you…

525
01:00:07,792 --> 01:00:09,792
I don't…

526
01:00:09,125 --> 01:00:12,958
-You came back late. -Hello. Kaori, serve me something strong.

527
01:00:13,042 --> 01:00:15,042
Safe.

528
01:00:17,792 --> 01:00:22,792
No matter how alone I feel...

529
01:00:22,875 --> 01:00:25,042
I'm not going to die.

530
01:00:29,958 --> 01:00:31,208
Shori, did something happen to you?

531
01:00:35,542 --> 01:00:37,542
Ya la vi.

532
01:00:40,667 --> 01:00:42,667
That?

533
01:00:46,208 --> 01:00:52,750
She has already moved on with her life. She looked happy. It looks like she's getting married.

534
01:01:04,542 --> 01:01:06,542
What good news.

535
01:01:05,625 --> 01:01:12,708
Yes. Damn. You know what? Her new boyfriend is a wonderful man. It is completely

536
01:01:12,792 --> 01:01:14,667
opposite to me.

537
01:01:20,708 --> 01:01:27,167
It gives me pleasure. She will be alright. I'm sure.

538
01:01:47,708 --> 01:01:54,292
Hey Shori! You haven't seen my movie yet.

539
01:01:54,375 --> 01:02:00,458
You're right. I'll see her before I leave. The boring Yakuza movie.

540
01:02:01,208 --> 01:02:06,125
Yeah! Well said. So, let's go! Come on, okay? Akira, come on, bring the car.

541
01:02:06,208 --> 01:02:10,917
-Come on. They will be impressed. -Yeah come on. That is.

542
01:02:11,208 --> 01:02:12,375
Safe?

543
01:02:23,958 --> 01:02:25,083
Hey Girl.

544
01:02:28,625 --> 01:02:30,500
Live well and enjoy your life.

545
01:02:32,583 --> 01:02:34,583
That?

546
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:51,625
Do you have somewhere to go? Do you want to join?

547
01:02:51,708 --> 01:02:56,208
-Boss, what are you talking about? -What am I talking about? It's good to have

548
01:02:56,292 --> 01:03:00,792
a bigger family. What is your name?

549
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,833
Masashi… Yamada.

550
01:03:11,833 --> 01:03:14,500
-How about? She's good, isn't she? -Okay. Alright.

551
01:03:14,583 --> 01:03:17,250
Well, it's not bad.

552
01:03:18,083 --> 01:03:20,000
Come back when you're settled.

553
01:03:24,917 --> 01:03:26,917
Let's go.

554
01:03:57,958 --> 01:03:59,208
Should we go now?

555
01:04:03,458 --> 01:04:05,458
Yeah.

556
01:04:30,208 --> 01:04:32,750
Hey, do you know yoga? I was the one who made it popular.

557
01:04:32,833 --> 01:04:34,292
Oh really?

558
01:04:35,167 --> 01:04:37,417
-It already started. -Thirty years ago, I worked

559
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:40,125
in an advertising agency.

560
01:04:40,208 --> 01:04:44,125
At that time, there was a boom in everything sports. And I made yoga popular...

561
01:04:44,208 --> 01:04:46,833
Nana. Good morning.

562
01:04:49,083 --> 01:04:50,292
Good morning.

563
01:04:50,375 --> 01:04:51,875
And... the one from the Yakuza?

564
01:04:52,917 --> 01:04:57,583
He is already gone... to the afterlife.

565
01:05:00,458 --> 01:05:02,208
To the beyond? I don't understand.

566
01:05:03,875 --> 01:05:06,167
Tell me, Nana, do you have any unfinished business or anything you regret from when

567
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:08,125
were you alive?

568
01:05:10,167 --> 01:05:12,167
That?

569
01:05:11,667 --> 01:05:14,458
It's probably the reason you're here.

570
01:05:17,375 --> 01:05:19,875
What are you saying? Is this some kind of cult?

571
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:26,917
A cult? How rude you are. By the way, do you want to record a movie?

572
01:05:27,625 --> 01:05:29,167
-Minako, shall we go? -Because?

573
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:31,250
Yeah.

574
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:33,667
Nana, sit here.

575
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:39,125
DECEASED

576
01:05:43,292 --> 01:05:45,667
Every day I get scared reading this.

577
01:05:47,958 --> 01:05:51,625
If I find Ryo's name, what will happen to me?

578
01:05:54,667 --> 01:05:56,667
I understand.

579
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:05,208
So, you wanted me to tell you about me, right?

580
01:06:06,083 --> 01:06:11,917
Yes. Before you go to the great beyond, I would like to know a little more about you.

581
01:06:14,833 --> 01:06:19,708
I am Minako Kawakami, thirty-five years old. She worked for the television station

582
01:06:19,792 --> 01:06:24,708
Hokeyuto as a journalist, and was the mother of a seven-year-old boy.

583
01:06:26,708 --> 01:06:28,583
And your husband?

584
01:06:29,792 --> 01:06:33,917
We broke up after Ryo was born. I wanted to continue working, but he didn't.

585
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,292
He wanted me to work. Since then, we are alone.

586
01:06:40,042 --> 01:06:44,042
Tell me more about… what this world was like for you.

587
01:06:45,958 --> 01:06:47,833
Do you mean the world I lived in?

588
01:06:47,917 --> 01:06:49,917
Yeah.

589
01:06:49,167 --> 01:06:56,000
Well I do not know. She was obsessed with work and my son...

590
01:07:02,417 --> 01:07:05,458
Now that I think about it, I don't know why I tried so hard.

591
01:07:08,458 --> 01:07:13,625
If you could come back to life, what would you like to do?

592
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Con Ryo…

593
01:07:23,833 --> 01:07:28,833
I would like to go on a trip. I was never able to take it on a trip anywhere.

594
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:37,708
And I also want to apologize to him.

595
01:07:49,458 --> 01:07:52,167
In this world, there are many unknown things that we cannot see as

596
01:07:52,250 --> 01:07:54,875
atoms, electrons and elementary particles.

597
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,750
This is very boring. -For example, what we experience in daily life is

598
01:07:57,833 --> 01:07:59,750
three-dimensional, or four-dimensional if we count time.

599
01:07:59,833 --> 01:08:01,750
-Have you seen this video yet? -But scientist Lisa Randall has

600
01:08:01,833 --> 01:08:03,833
I know.

601
01:08:03,875 --> 01:08:05,833
Demonstrated that a fifth dimension exists.

602
01:08:05,917 --> 01:08:07,958
This will go viral.

603
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:10,583
-Wow, she's a genius. This is incredible. -And some researchers claim that there are

604
01:08:10,667 --> 01:08:13,500
up to eleven dimensions in theory, although this has not been demonstrated.

605
01:08:13,583 --> 01:08:15,292
Are we going to publish it? If it is a good idea.

606
01:08:15,375 --> 01:08:17,083
Hey. Yasuko. Don't go cutting your wrists like Nana, please.

607
01:08:17,167 --> 01:08:20,333
What is clear to us is that the visible world is not the only thing that exists, are they

608
01:08:20,417 --> 01:08:22,000
OK?

609
01:08:25,125 --> 01:08:26,250
Are they paying attention?

610
01:08:26,333 --> 01:08:27,625
-Yeah. -Yeah.

611
01:08:28,375 --> 01:08:32,750
OK. So, let's analyze the word "dimension." It is defined as a

612
01:08:32,833 --> 01:08:37,208
indicator for measuring a given space.

613
01:08:37,292 --> 01:08:40,125
-How stupid she is. -Good. So what is a

614
01:08:40,208 --> 01:08:42,958
dimension? A dimension is a line that…

615
01:08:43,958 --> 01:08:45,958
Ten.

616
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,625
-Here is our dessert. -Thank you.

617
01:08:50,417 --> 01:08:52,417
Hour.

618
01:08:51,542 --> 01:08:53,542
Look, it's time.

619
01:08:54,542 --> 01:08:59,917
It's already clear to me that I died, but can I kill someone? I want to get rid of

620
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,167
someone.

621
01:09:08,042 --> 01:09:12,083
Hey, Nana, saying that is bad luck.

622
01:09:12,667 --> 01:09:17,250
The people on this side cannot harm the people of the living world.

623
01:09:18,125 --> 01:09:22,958
What the fuck. They're all dead!

624
01:09:38,958 --> 01:09:40,958
Understand…

625
01:09:51,042 --> 01:09:54,125
This doesn't taste like anything!

626
01:10:00,417 --> 01:10:07,333
This is real hell! How long should I be here!?

627
01:10:21,208 --> 01:10:28,125
Hey, Nana... why don't you join us for a moment? I want to show you something.

628
01:10:29,833 --> 01:10:31,833
That?

629
01:10:32,667 --> 01:10:35,000
You're going to have to trust. Just do it.

630
01:10:41,708 --> 01:10:43,708
Well, that's it. Walking.

631
01:11:17,333 --> 01:11:19,208
What is this?

632
01:11:21,792 --> 01:11:26,542
All of us who die and leave our loved ones behind… we come to look for…

633
01:11:26,625 --> 01:11:28,667
those people.

634
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:37,667
Our beloved ones…

635
01:11:39,125 --> 01:11:42,167
I have no idea what your pending issue may be, but... we will help you in everything

636
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:44,583
that is possible.

637
01:11:54,042 --> 01:11:56,208
Hey! Come here!

638
01:12:01,958 --> 01:12:05,042
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

639
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,333
Wow! It just can't be! I got a message from you know who!

640
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:19,708
Oh really!?

641
01:12:20,333 --> 01:12:24,042
Yes, look. Look, here it is. Look what she says.

642
01:12:32,042 --> 01:12:37,917
There is someone... I must tell you that I am sorry.

643
01:13:04,458 --> 01:13:08,125
This is your baby's face. Here are the eyes and the nose...

644
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:11,625
-Look, it's big. -How could I not accept my death?

645
01:13:11,708 --> 01:13:13,958
Until my daughter gave birth, I desperately wished

646
01:13:14,042 --> 01:13:16,250
-stay here to see it. -Wow.

647
01:13:17,208 --> 01:13:19,208
This world is very forgiving, isn't it?

648
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:23,167
I think exactly the same.

649
01:13:24,375 --> 01:13:25,417
Does it move.

650
01:13:26,042 --> 01:13:30,750
-I have managed to be here with them so much... -How nice this is.

651
01:13:33,333 --> 01:13:34,750
I no longer have earrings.

652
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:47,208
I have been watching my children for a long time, and they are very strong.

653
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:57,667
I think they would have been fine without me from the beginning. Sometimes I think that.

654
01:14:05,542 --> 01:14:08,708
You know that's not true.

655
01:14:14,833 --> 01:14:17,542
YOUR NAME DOES NOT APPEAR IN THE SHELTERS

656
01:14:17,625 --> 01:14:20,125
THERE IS NO PROGRESS ON HOKUTO TV

657
01:14:22,542 --> 01:14:26,208
Oh, it can't be! Look at Michael! Hey hey. What are you doing here asleep? Let's go to you

658
01:14:26,292 --> 01:14:29,958
room. Come. Mr. Tanaka, help me. Here.

659
01:14:30,042 --> 01:14:32,042
Yeah.

660
01:14:34,083 --> 01:14:36,917
Hey, wake up. Very good. Okay, one, and two, and…

661
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,792
Michael, hey. Hey, hey, let's go. Above! Okay, okay, okay, walk, walk. Yes, it

662
01:14:39,875 --> 01:14:41,250
Calm down, hey, hey, hey. You are very drunk. Let's go so you can rest.

663
01:14:41,333 --> 01:14:43,083
-I have, I have. -Who is it?

664
01:14:43,167 --> 01:14:46,375
Yes. I have it, I have it. Let's go. I have it. Carefully.

665
01:14:55,375 --> 01:14:57,375
Still writing?

666
01:14:58,375 --> 01:15:03,667
Yes. I'm enjoying it. But I don't think I'm anywhere near the end.

667
01:15:11,458 --> 01:15:14,708
I already spoke, now it's your turn, Akira. Tell me.

668
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:19,542
That? No no. I don't have anything interesting to tell.

669
01:15:19,625 --> 01:15:23,292
You always avoid talking when they ask you about yourself.

670
01:15:23,375 --> 01:15:24,750
Do I really do that?

671
01:15:26,333 --> 01:15:29,375
I just want to know what your life was like, Akira.

672
01:15:30,583 --> 01:15:36,625
Minako, listen; I feel your journalist spirit.

673
01:15:38,208 --> 01:15:40,208
That's how it is.

674
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:51,375
Well… I guess I don't mind telling you.

675
01:15:54,917 --> 01:15:58,917
The reason why I haven't rested.

676
01:16:19,417 --> 01:16:21,292
Is that… is your…?

677
01:16:22,167 --> 01:16:24,167
Yeah.

678
01:16:32,208 --> 01:16:37,458
My dad seems stubborn, right? For me, who has been physically weak since

679
01:16:37,542 --> 01:16:42,792
little one… my dad was the scariest person ever.

680
01:16:54,458 --> 01:16:56,000
Your food stinks.

681
01:17:01,458 --> 01:17:04,833
-Look. He is lifting her up. -Wow! That!?

682
01:17:05,458 --> 01:17:10,500
-But what are you going to do with that? -Are you going to eat it?

683
01:17:10,583 --> 01:17:14,292
-Gross. -Oh no! Sorry. Sorry.

684
01:17:14,375 --> 01:17:18,292
-She scares me. Strange. -Damn, she walked past me.

685
01:17:18,375 --> 01:17:19,625
-Are you OK? -Are you OK?

686
01:17:34,208 --> 01:17:36,208
Nana…

687
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:55,125
¡ Yasuko! Yasuko! Yasuko! Perdon!

688
01:18:00,125 --> 01:18:03,208
Nana… Why? Nana…

689
01:18:25,958 --> 01:18:31,875
-Nana, why? -Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry.

690
01:18:31,958 --> 01:18:35,917
No... Sorry, Yasuko, sorry.

691
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:38,667
-Nana. -Sorry.

692
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:46,792
Nana. Nana, no, Nana. Because you did? Until 18:46) Nana.

693
01:18:46,875 --> 01:18:48,875
Oh, no.

694
01:18:58,792 --> 01:19:02,458
I practically only lived in my bed. He was the son of the ranch owner, but he couldn't

695
01:19:02,542 --> 01:19:04,125
work it.

696
01:19:11,875 --> 01:19:16,708
I always thought that my dad didn't accept me as just another member of the family.

697
01:19:16,792 --> 01:19:17,958
family.

698
01:19:34,875 --> 01:19:41,833
When they told me I would die, I thought "why me?" Many times I took it out on myself

699
01:19:41,917 --> 01:19:47,917
family. I'm sure I hurt them.

700
01:20:19,333 --> 01:20:26,250
Probably… that's the reason why I can't go to the afterlife.

701
01:20:33,833 --> 01:20:40,375
Although my father almost never reads novels, he has been writing his own for many years.

702
01:20:41,042 --> 01:20:44,542
A story about your son.

703
01:20:54,083 --> 01:21:00,792
If I were still alive, maybe he wouldn't be writing a novel.

704
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,625
Or maybe it would, I'll never know.

705
01:21:11,583 --> 01:21:18,500
But that makes me very happy. I feel like for the first time I can meet him.

706
01:21:24,042 --> 01:21:30,667
AKIRA WAS EXCITED ABOUT THE NEWBORN CALF

707
01:21:33,292 --> 01:21:40,208
But… I know it's too late, because I'm no longer alive.

708
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:11,000
Look, it's time.

709
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:14,250
How much mess.

710
01:22:15,250 --> 01:22:16,542
Sorry.

711
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:20,083
What are you writing?

712
01:22:21,625 --> 01:22:25,417
I keep track of everything that's happened since I got here.

713
01:22:30,208 --> 01:22:33,875
BEFORE GOING TO THE "BEYOND"

714
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:38,833
Something happens?

715
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:49,917
Know? I apologize. But… that didn't change anything. Because?

716
01:23:06,375 --> 01:23:13,458
I am sure that one day your voice will be heard. Peaceful.

717
01:23:20,792 --> 01:23:22,458
That's not an answer.

718
01:23:22,542 --> 01:23:24,583
I lend you that.

719
01:25:02,250 --> 01:25:03,792
-Bye bye! -Have a good night. See you tomorrow.

720
01:25:03,875 --> 01:25:05,667
Bye bye! Have a good night!

721
01:25:15,417 --> 01:25:22,333
Minako! Minako! Minako! Minako, listen! He is alive! Your son! I heard that

722
01:25:24,667 --> 01:25:26,125
is alive!

723
01:25:57,458 --> 01:25:59,042
Is alive!

724
01:26:10,917 --> 01:26:13,417
We will wait here.

725
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:42,083
Ma'am, Ryo has a fever again.

726
01:26:42,167 --> 01:26:45,958
It's been like this for a week. Tomorrow we will take him to the doctor again.

727
01:26:46,042 --> 01:26:48,042
Yeah.

728
01:27:05,750 --> 01:27:07,333
Mother. Mother…

729
01:27:17,833 --> 01:27:20,167
Ryo, tomorrow we will go to the doctor.

730
01:27:21,625 --> 01:27:23,417
I love my mom.

731
01:27:27,417 --> 01:27:31,000
I know. I'm sure they will find it.

732
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:51,250
Mother…

733
01:28:00,042 --> 01:28:04,292
Ryo… Forgive me. I left you alone.

734
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:11,375
Mother. Mom… Are you there?

735
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:22,417
Yes. Here I am.

736
01:28:28,083 --> 01:28:35,000
I wanted to apologize to you. I was on my way to school to pick you up, but then

737
01:28:36,208 --> 01:28:42,208
I was swept away by the tsunami. Forgive me.

738
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:51,167
Mom, when are we going home?

739
01:28:54,833 --> 01:28:56,875
I wish I could.

740
01:29:04,250 --> 01:29:07,292
Will I have to stay and live here, ma?

741
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:16,833
Forgive me. I will be taking care of you so that you are never alone,

742
01:29:18,750 --> 01:29:20,750
okay?

743
01:29:27,875 --> 01:29:29,875
Okay.

744
01:29:29,708 --> 01:29:31,708
Mother…

745
01:29:35,042 --> 01:29:37,042
Tell me a bedtime story.

746
01:29:37,625 --> 01:29:42,208
Clear. What story do you want me to tell you?

747
01:29:44,125 --> 01:29:46,875
Something fun you've done these days.

748
01:29:48,667 --> 01:29:55,583
In the world that mom is in now, we all help each other to find the

749
01:29:58,667 --> 01:30:03,958
people we love. Like a parade.

750
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:11,208
How nice.

751
01:30:11,583 --> 01:30:17,875
Yes. They were the ones who helped me find you.

752
01:30:17,958 --> 01:30:19,250
I understand.

753
01:30:21,042 --> 01:30:26,125
So, now it's your turn to help others.

754
01:30:28,583 --> 01:30:31,083
Yes you're right.

755
01:31:39,792 --> 01:31:40,875
Hello, Mr. Tanaka.

756
01:31:43,833 --> 01:31:45,833
Yeah?

757
01:31:47,625 --> 01:31:51,625
I still have pending issues to resolve. It would help me?

758
01:31:54,167 --> 01:31:55,833
If it's in my possibilities.

759
01:32:02,917 --> 01:32:08,458
Akira, don't see me with that face of heartbreak.

760
01:32:08,542 --> 01:32:12,083
What nonsense are you talking? I did not do it.

761
01:32:12,167 --> 01:32:15,708
Well, Minako is very attractive. If I were younger, I would

762
01:32:15,875 --> 01:32:19,667
-I would have invited… -How disgusting.

763
01:32:19,750 --> 01:32:22,167
What thing? What's disgusting?

764
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:24,250
Gross.

765
01:32:26,625 --> 01:32:28,625
Minako…

766
01:32:29,458 --> 01:32:31,458
I'm back.

767
01:32:32,875 --> 01:32:37,875
-Come here. -Minako, do you want coffee?

768
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,167
Thank you, Kaori.

769
01:32:43,708 --> 01:32:50,625
Hey, Michael, I haven't thanked you yet. So thanks.

770
01:32:52,208 --> 01:32:59,125
-Hey, stop it. You make me blush. -Your movie… You have to finish it.

771
01:33:03,542 --> 01:33:05,542
That?

772
01:33:05,958 --> 01:33:09,792
I'll stay until I finish it. You want to show it to someone, right?

773
01:33:15,542 --> 01:33:18,875
Please stop now! You'll seriously make me cry.

774
01:33:18,958 --> 01:33:21,000
He is ashamed.

775
01:33:22,750 --> 01:33:26,583
Good! I'm going to do it. Yes. It's going to be the best movie in the world. Would you like to come inside,

776
01:33:26,667 --> 01:33:31,208
-Nana? -What are you talking about?

777
01:33:32,167 --> 01:33:34,458
Hey, Nana, this is mandatory, huh?

778
01:33:34,542 --> 01:33:36,125
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

779
01:33:36,958 --> 01:33:38,958
Tanaka.

780
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Yeah?

781
01:33:39,042 --> 01:33:41,042
Bring the camera!

782
01:33:40,042 --> 01:33:41,292
-Your wish is my command. -Let's do it!

783
01:33:41,375 --> 01:33:43,375
GOOD!

784
01:33:43,042 --> 01:33:44,333
Filming.

785
01:33:53,208 --> 01:33:54,375
-It's recording! -Yeah!

786
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,958
Take one. Ready? Action!

787
01:34:03,125 --> 01:34:04,625
Fifty years have passed...

788
01:34:20,583 --> 01:34:25,542
The movie is almost finished. Koga, the protagonist, believed in revolution and

789
01:34:25,625 --> 01:34:30,583
He gave himself fully to the student protest. But for fear of being

790
01:34:30,667 --> 01:34:35,625
arrested, decided to return to Tokeyio the same day of the protest... leaving behind

791
01:34:35,708 --> 01:34:37,000
his girlfriend.

792
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:46,042
He just ran away… Pathetic fool.

793
01:34:48,917 --> 01:34:51,833
Wait, Mr. Koga!

794
01:34:55,708 --> 01:34:59,917
I'm sorry. I failed to make the revolution possible.

795
01:35:01,792 --> 01:35:08,750
I don't need you to do that. Just stay next to me.

796
01:35:18,292 --> 01:35:20,667
I'm sure we'll see each other again.

797
01:35:40,750 --> 01:35:44,500
And then, Koga, gave up the student protest and fled to Tokeyio.

798
01:35:44,583 --> 01:35:48,375
Our new product, star sand. It's going to be a success!

799
01:35:48,458 --> 01:35:50,583
-Cheers! -Cheers!

800
01:35:51,042 --> 01:35:53,667
-Maiko married Sasaki. -Congratulations!

801
01:35:53,750 --> 01:35:56,292
I call it because of the star sand we talked about.

802
01:35:56,375 --> 01:35:59,125
Kouga dedicated himself to working non-stop. Weird but cute?

803
01:35:59,208 --> 01:36:03,833
We both buried our memories and moved on with our lives.

804
01:36:11,042 --> 01:36:13,792
Mom, we're leaving. Bye, Mom. See you.

805
01:36:13,875 --> 01:36:15,750
Bye, Mom!

806
01:36:22,333 --> 01:36:24,708
Fifty years have passed since then...

807
01:36:27,333 --> 01:36:30,500
Koga decided to return to the city of Okeyinawa.

808
01:36:38,667 --> 01:36:43,500
Memories of that time come to mind as if it were yesterday.

809
01:36:48,625 --> 01:36:50,625
Countries…

810
01:36:52,875 --> 01:36:54,833
He's getting into character.

811
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:04,375
Are you Mr. Mitsuru Koga?

812
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:13,083
Koga had a meeting with Maiko's granddaughter.

813
01:37:15,708 --> 01:37:17,708
That? I?

814
01:37:21,833 --> 01:37:25,292
Mr. Koga, you know my grandmother, don't you?

815
01:37:26,958 --> 01:37:30,458
Are you Maiko's granddaughter?

816
01:37:31,583 --> 01:37:38,500
Please come see her. My grandmother has been waiting for him for a long time.

817
01:37:48,292 --> 01:37:50,292
Cut!

818
01:37:51,792 --> 01:37:55,708
-Incredible. -Incredible, are you a child prodigy?

819
01:37:55,792 --> 01:37:59,000
Incredible. Perfect. Güeno. Güeno. Güeno. Güeno. Güeno.

820
01:37:59,250 --> 01:38:02,667
-They flatter me. Enough! Enough. -Nana!

821
01:38:02,750 --> 01:38:05,917
"Please come see her." Güeno, Güeno. Güeno.

822
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,375
-Hey! Making fun. -Michael! Don't make fun of her!

823
01:38:16,875 --> 01:38:22,542
I see... You left this world before me.

824
01:38:25,875 --> 01:38:29,792
It's very good. It's a great movie.

825
01:38:46,875 --> 01:38:48,875
Mr. Koga!

826
01:38:51,208 --> 01:38:53,208
See you later!

827
01:38:58,375 --> 01:39:02,042
Enjoy your life! Enjoy it, sir!

828
01:39:11,292 --> 01:39:12,958
Mr. Koga!

829
01:39:23,458 --> 01:39:25,958
¡ Maiko! ¿ ¡ Maiko!?

830
01:39:31,292 --> 01:39:33,292
¿¡Countries!?

831
01:39:33,542 --> 01:39:34,917
Mr. Koga!

832
01:39:37,292 --> 01:39:41,042
-¡ Maiko, hola! Maiko! -¡ No, Michael, no!

833
01:39:41,125 --> 01:39:43,125
That?

834
01:39:44,917 --> 01:39:49,167
-Wait! Michael! Michael! Michael! -Maiko, here!

835
01:39:49,250 --> 01:39:50,542
¡Michael!

836
01:39:52,375 --> 01:39:55,208
-Michael, wait! Come! -Don't run, Michael!

837
01:39:57,250 --> 01:39:59,250
Countries!

838
01:40:24,708 --> 01:40:26,583
-¡Wow!
-¡Wow!

839
01:40:28,958 --> 01:40:33,167
-Let's go see it on the big screen! -Oh.

840
01:40:33,250 --> 01:40:35,000
What's going on?

841
01:40:40,750 --> 01:40:47,917
The thing is… I want to give this movie to someone.

842
01:40:52,042 --> 01:40:58,958
But I'm embarrassed to do things like that. Friends, could you help me?

843
01:41:00,667 --> 01:41:02,667
That? No, go and do it yourself.

844
01:41:03,958 --> 01:41:05,958
Yes, I know, but...

845
01:41:09,958 --> 01:41:16,875
Michael, listen. Let's go together. Ill go with you.

846
01:41:31,292 --> 01:41:35,542
This is nice, like we're family.

847
01:41:42,042 --> 01:41:44,083
Then I will go.

848
01:42:05,417 --> 01:42:07,125
Oh really? Many people?

849
01:42:07,208 --> 01:42:08,375
It's crazy.

850
01:42:10,792 --> 01:42:12,333
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

851
01:42:12,417 --> 01:42:18,125
There's something I want to show you guys. Come, follow me.

852
01:42:19,208 --> 01:42:22,417
-That? -It's this way. Look, look, look, look!

853
01:42:22,500 --> 01:42:24,375
-That? -Wow!

854
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:28,333
Come, come, come, come, come, come? It's me. It's me.

855
01:42:28,417 --> 01:42:30,083
-That? That's you? -You are an important producer.

856
01:42:30,167 --> 01:42:31,708
I'm flattered…

857
01:42:31,917 --> 01:42:33,500
-You weren't lying. -Wow!

858
01:42:33,583 --> 01:42:35,500
Never, I only tell the truth.

859
01:42:35,583 --> 01:42:37,667
-No, nobody believed you, right? -I'm wondering the same.

860
01:42:37,750 --> 01:42:41,667
-Incredible! -Right? It's just that I'm handsome.

861
01:42:49,375 --> 01:42:54,167
What nerves. I'm very bad at this.

862
01:42:54,250 --> 01:42:57,667
You're going to be okay, Michael. We will wait for you here.

863
01:43:01,917 --> 01:43:07,333
-Better another day with more calm. -Because? We already came here.

864
01:43:07,417 --> 01:43:09,875
-But... -Now, you?

865
01:43:13,250 --> 01:43:14,417
¿Sasaki?

866
01:43:21,792 --> 01:43:25,333
Why do you come after so long?

867
01:43:29,083 --> 01:43:36,083
By Maiko. I want to apologize. Please let me see her.

868
01:43:44,667 --> 01:43:46,667
Happens.

869
01:44:02,708 --> 01:44:05,667
Sasaki, did you… when did you die?

870
01:44:07,417 --> 01:44:08,833
Two years ago, from cancer.

871
01:44:10,250 --> 01:44:12,250
I see.

872
01:44:14,417 --> 01:44:16,417
What's that?

873
01:44:15,917 --> 01:44:22,833
Oh, this? I finished a movie. It's about Maiko, and also about me and you.

874
01:44:27,292 --> 01:44:29,833
Even dead, do you make movies?

875
01:44:31,667 --> 01:44:38,583
-You are obsessed. -You're right. It's the only thing I know how to do.

876
01:44:39,542 --> 01:44:40,833
Here.

877
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:15,000
Maiko hasn't changed at all.

878
01:45:23,750 --> 01:45:26,375
Maiko has always supported your work.

879
01:45:27,708 --> 01:45:32,833
But, Maiko, she... chose you.

880
01:46:14,708 --> 01:46:21,625
Know? I still think about the time we shared.

881
01:46:28,792 --> 01:46:35,708
We could not achieve the revolution. But... what we did achieve was unite. I'm sure.

882
01:46:51,417 --> 01:46:53,417
Countries…

883
01:47:16,625 --> 01:47:18,000
Maiko, yo…

884
01:47:21,792 --> 01:47:23,792
Sorry.

885
01:47:28,333 --> 01:47:29,417
Very sorry.

886
01:47:50,875 --> 01:47:55,667
-Hello! Hey, hey, hey, hey! -All went well?

887
01:47:55,750 --> 01:47:58,083
Yes, everything went well. Perfect. Good. Good, good.

888
01:47:58,167 --> 01:48:00,625
Wait, you didn't give him the movie?

889
01:48:00,708 --> 01:48:05,542
Well, if you think about it, movies can't be watched at home. I know it

890
01:48:05,625 --> 01:48:10,667
-I'll give it when it comes out on DVD. -But this movie will not come out on DVD.

891
01:48:10,750 --> 01:48:15,833
Please, it's okay. Good. Let's go back home. Yeah?

892
01:48:39,375 --> 01:48:44,583
Hey, friends. What if we project it? We can invite others not

893
01:48:44,667 --> 01:48:46,667
alive.

894
01:48:55,667 --> 01:48:59,292
Great idea! That's exactly what I was about to say.

895
01:48:59,375 --> 01:49:03,375
Oh really? Yes Yes. Let's do it!

896
01:49:03,458 --> 01:49:05,458
Let's do it.

897
01:49:04,542 --> 01:49:06,542
-Go Go. -Yeah.

898
01:49:05,583 --> 01:49:07,583
Perfect!

899
01:49:23,375 --> 01:49:26,875
Michael, we're ready.

900
01:49:43,625 --> 01:49:50,417
Good night all. I'm Michael. I forced my friends to help me finish

901
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,042
this movie.

902
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:05,417
This movie, actually. This film has the power to revolutionize the era,

903
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:12,042
and I also think it connects the past with the present.

904
01:50:13,375 --> 01:50:18,792
Well... "Even dead, do you make movies?"

905
01:50:22,792 --> 01:50:28,875
Someone told me that, but... as they say, the first person to do it wins.

906
01:50:28,958 --> 01:50:32,667
I hope you enjoy the feature.

907
01:51:59,333 --> 01:52:02,542
I have… a new idea.

908
01:52:03,375 --> 01:52:08,208
-Other movie? -This is... my autobiography

909
01:52:08,292 --> 01:52:12,375
from here. That's my new idea.

910
01:52:12,458 --> 01:52:16,375
Michael, that... that's my idea.

911
01:52:16,833 --> 01:52:22,125
So let's do it together. A collaborative masterpiece.

912
01:52:22,208 --> 01:52:25,708
-I do not allow it. -I understand.

913
01:52:31,167 --> 01:52:33,875
Minako, are you okay?

914
01:52:33,958 --> 01:52:39,250
Yes. It's just that I process everything that happened.

915
01:52:42,458 --> 01:52:49,375
Me too. I think I also feel a bit scattered.

916
01:52:51,250 --> 01:52:53,292
-Mr. Tanaka… -Yes?

917
01:52:53,917 --> 01:52:56,792
Tell me what the world is like in the afterlife.

918
01:52:59,250 --> 01:53:00,375
That's classified.

919
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:03,500
That?

920
01:53:03,792 --> 01:53:06,042
Mr. Tanaka is like our warden.

921
01:53:08,375 --> 01:53:11,667
What is the reason for knowing it until now? That scares me!

922
01:53:12,917 --> 01:53:16,833
-Please! Why don't you tell us? -You will find out very soon.

923
01:53:16,958 --> 01:53:20,750
Tanaka is too serious.

924
01:53:25,542 --> 01:53:29,208
But you know? It was fun to film it.

925
01:53:37,792 --> 01:53:42,625
TRUE? The movies are good.

926
01:53:44,250 --> 01:53:48,833
A lot of people with the same goal.

927
01:53:49,583 --> 01:53:51,458
It's great.

928
01:53:51,917 --> 01:53:53,917
Yeah.

929
01:53:52,833 --> 01:53:54,833
¿No?

930
01:53:54,292 --> 01:54:01,375
Nana. You have to make more movies. Use the notes from my room.

931
01:54:03,125 --> 01:54:04,667
Nana, you can do it!

932
01:54:04,750 --> 01:54:06,292
That? Why only me?

933
01:54:08,750 --> 01:54:14,125
Akira, it's going to be your responsibility now.

934
01:54:19,583 --> 01:54:22,958
Make sure you keep track of this world.

935
01:54:23,792 --> 01:54:27,000
You can count on me.

936
01:54:30,542 --> 01:54:36,667
But you have to stay on the offensive. Don't lose!

937
01:54:36,750 --> 01:54:41,292
Am I going to compete against someone?

938
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:49,583
-Now, let's toast! Let's toast. Yes. Cheers. -Chin.

939
01:54:56,042 --> 01:54:57,500
Let's toast.

940
01:55:00,917 --> 01:55:02,917
-Let's toast. -Let's toast.

941
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Let's toast.

942
01:55:20,083 --> 01:55:22,542
-We still have food, you have to eat. -To eat.

943
01:55:22,625 --> 01:55:24,083
Alright.

944
01:55:25,167 --> 01:55:26,333
A comer.

945
01:55:26,500 --> 01:55:28,167
Can you pass me some kinpira?

946
01:55:29,042 --> 01:55:30,792
-This? -Yeah.

947
01:55:31,042 --> 01:55:32,917
Mr. Tanaka, do you want karaage?

948
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:36,833
-Just one, please. Yes, thanks. -You are welcome.

949
01:55:36,917 --> 01:55:39,250
-Thank you. Do you want some fries? -Yes please.

950
01:55:39,333 --> 01:55:46,250
-That's OK? -Yeah. thank you so much. You want to? Thank you.

951
01:55:49,292 --> 01:55:53,250
-Minako, do you want fries? -Please.

952
01:56:15,375 --> 01:56:17,917
THE SOUND OF THE WAVES,

953
01:56:21,792 --> 01:56:24,417
AND AN EMPTY BEACH.

954
01:56:25,583 --> 01:56:26,750
knock knock

955
01:56:34,083 --> 01:56:37,292
Is everyone asleep?

956
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:43,125
Yes. In the end, Michael fell asleep while talking.

957
01:56:43,208 --> 01:56:48,625
He is always full of energy. Yeah.

958
01:56:53,750 --> 01:56:57,125
-Take. -Thank you so much.

959
01:57:07,417 --> 01:57:09,792
Akira, are you going to continue writing?

960
01:57:11,125 --> 01:57:16,333
Yes. I think I'll do it until my dad finishes his novel.

961
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:21,042
I see. Be sure to write about me.

962
01:57:21,875 --> 01:57:26,458
Of course. I even plan to make you the main character.

963
01:57:26,542 --> 01:57:31,333
Oh no. Please no. A small role.

964
01:57:35,417 --> 01:57:40,417
I wish I could…stay with you longer.

965
01:57:42,333 --> 01:57:44,583
Where did that come from?

966
01:57:48,083 --> 01:57:52,042
It's just... I have feelings for you.

967
01:57:55,417 --> 01:57:57,542
Where did that confession come from?

968
01:57:58,250 --> 01:58:01,750
-Is rare? -Yes it's weird.

969
01:58:03,542 --> 01:58:08,750
If we had met in life, would things have been different?

970
01:58:12,167 --> 01:58:13,458
That cannot be known.

971
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:17,500
It's true.

972
01:58:20,583 --> 01:58:25,250
Akira… Thank you. I had a good time.

973
01:58:31,708 --> 01:58:34,625
Me too. Thank you.

974
01:59:56,208 --> 01:59:57,625
Okay, let's go.

975
01:59:58,708 --> 01:59:59,917
Okay, I'm ready.

976
02:00:03,125 --> 02:00:05,167
-Okay, let's do it. -Forward. Very good. wait,

977
02:00:05,250 --> 02:00:07,500
-Wait, this is the door. -Hey, let us pass.

978
02:00:07,583 --> 02:00:08,875
In the middle, okay.

979
02:00:10,625 --> 02:00:12,625
Okay, understood.

980
02:02:33,375 --> 02:02:35,250
Wow, so many people.

981
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,208
-Oh really? Yes please. -Soon.

982
02:02:42,292 --> 02:02:44,208
-I count on you. -I'll do it soon.

983
02:02:46,042 --> 02:02:51,500
Oh, so this should be… Excuse me. Ryo.

984
02:02:56,042 --> 02:02:58,042
It's been a while.

985
02:02:57,042 --> 02:03:01,875
Yes, quite a bit. We still have time. Do you want to go for tea?

986
02:03:01,958 --> 02:03:04,667
-Yes of course. -How big you are.

987
02:03:06,042 --> 02:03:09,583
Thank you very much for coming. Is this your first time at Tokeyio?

988
02:03:09,667 --> 02:03:12,625
Oh yeah. There are too many people.

989
02:03:12,708 --> 02:03:17,708
-Yes, compared to our home, yes. -Yeah. You're right.

990
02:03:18,833 --> 02:03:21,458
Hey, are you graduating next year already?

991
02:03:22,042 --> 02:03:24,042
Yes, exactly.

992
02:03:24,375 --> 02:03:26,375
And have you… decided what to do?

993
02:03:27,292 --> 02:03:31,708
Well… still… I'm not so sure about that.

994
02:03:35,500 --> 02:03:39,000
Maybe I'll try my mother's work, I think.

995
02:03:45,375 --> 02:03:51,375
-Please, someday tell me about her. -Yeah. Of course.

996
02:03:51,458 --> 02:03:53,625
Either way, I'm excited.

997
02:03:54,042 --> 02:03:56,958
I hope you like it.

998
02:03:57,333 --> 02:03:59,583
Nana! How long.

999
02:04:00,125 --> 02:04:02,250

-Do you want me to carry you? -No. So I'm fine.

1012
02:04:56,875 --> 02:04:59,917
-Hey. It's already going to start. Get comfortable. -Settle down.
