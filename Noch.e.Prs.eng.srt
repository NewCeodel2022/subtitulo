159
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,386
Jae-kyung?

160
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,308
Still there?

161
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:23,521
Jae-kyung?

162
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,566
Jae-kyung, are you there?

163
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,532
[dramatic music]

164
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,328
[sirens wailing]

165
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,719
Uh, the boss is here, sir.

166
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,930
Did you get any sleep?

167
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,225
Have you had anything to eat?

168
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:26,727
Yeah.

169
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:28,938
Today would've been…

170
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,733
Ji-eun's birthday, right?

171
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:38,322
[Do-soo sighs] How could that bastard,
Chairman Doh have done this?

172
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,283
He must be going senile in his old age.

173
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,121
No matter how things are
between us and them,

174
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,207
this is a line you don't cross.

175
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:53,754
And after he fawned all over you
to get you to join his side…

176
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,178
[sighs]

177
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:03,681
[clicks tongue]

178
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,518
What can we do about this situation?

179
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,229
[Do-soo] They'll all continue to overstep

180
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,398
because they know
they have us by the throat.

181
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,567
I'm ashamed to say…

182
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,612
but there's nothing I can do.

183
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,631
Then I'll meet with Chairman Doh.

184
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:41,010
[suspenseful music plays]

185
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,639
What would you do?

186
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:48,767
I would do whatever you ask of me, sir.

187
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,647
Isn't this what
you've been wanting anyway?

188
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,109
It's inevitable.

189
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,795
[Chairman Doh breathing deeply]

190
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,009
[exhales]

191
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:25,095
I'm grieved by the loss
of your sister and niece.

192
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,014
[clicks tongue]

193
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,308
Of course, I was shocked to hear the news.

194
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:32,770
It's not enough to say
that we're in a rough profession.

195
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:37,525
Only a real lowlife
would think of going after family.

196
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:38,984
[scoffs]

197
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,862
Some asshole has no idea
the mistake he made.

198
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,240
[sighs]

199
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,282
[clicks tongue]

200
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,953
I'll find out who did this.
You have my word.

201
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,872
And serve them up to you.

202
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:52,957
You hear me?

203
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,257
What's done has been done.

204
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,094
Doing that won't change anything.

205
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:12,309
Hearing you didn't give the order,
I'll see it as an accident.

206
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,769
[chuckles] Good.

207
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,105
That's it.

208
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,356
[sucks teeth]

209
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:20,067
You know, I admire your attitude.

210
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,279
It may sound cool but life goes on.

211
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,073
So what is it that you want?

212
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,158
What can I do?

213
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:32,037
I'm assuming you must have
something in mind,

214
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,790
or you wouldn't have asked
for this meeting.

215
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,171
Let me splash some cold water
on myself first.

216
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,716
Sure, yeah.

217
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,139
[Chairman Doh] Hey.

218
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,444
There's no reason for you
to be on edge, huh?

219
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,697
What's going to happen
when we're just sitting here naked?

220
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,449
Must you embarrass me?

221
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:09,575
I apologize.

222
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,243
Try to relax.

223
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,454

[chair creaks]

[Do-soo] Very good work.

00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,519
Any injuries?

244
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,479
I'm fine, sir.

245
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,829
[Do-soo] You discarded your phone, right?

246
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,456
You can use this one for now.

247
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:48,001
I got you new identification
and some cash.

Jeju Island.

00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,427
[Do-soo] You hide out there a week.

252
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,805
From there, we'll put you on a boat

253
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,515
to Vladivostok, Russia.

254
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,560
Safer in Russia than China.

255
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:08,147
You know how close the Bukseong Gang is
with the Chinese.

256
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,690
I don't care where you send me.

257
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,150
Tae-gu.

258
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,402
Yes, sir?

259
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,530
Just know that you saved us all.

260
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:22,953
Let's go.

261
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,500
The boat comes in a week.

262
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,337
Enjoy the scenery and the fresh air.

263
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,965
You should just think of it
as a short holiday.

264
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,259
Yeah.

Yes, sir. All taken care of.

00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,996
And our guys?

not the Chinese knockoffs.

Here you go. I'll throw in a box of ammo.
I have more for sale.

Wow! Great fucking deal.

302
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,422
I'm certainly not gonna argue the price,

303
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,508
but are you concerned
about selling so low?

304
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:07,469
Make the Bukseong gang
or the Russians get upset with you.

You buying or not?

Sure I am.

00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,308

I hope you can appreciate how hard it was
to pay you on American cash.

310

During this recession,
it's nearly impossible.

Here you go. Take 'em apart and wrap 'em.

to send them than, uh…

-How?

You want me to put them in the mail,

Yeah, all right,
and I'm just saying these things smell.

Cut the shit and pack 'em.

Fishing boats are the safest.

Kuto,

320
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,635
why are you selling
so aggressively lately, huh?

321
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:53,390
You usually work through the Russians,
now you put together your own deals.

322
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:54,975
So…

Yes, sir.

00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,001
I'm just curious.
I heard about you moving here.

They told me you started a farm.

How long will you stay?

332

About a week is what I was told.

But I'm not sure.

Maybe, your balls just dropped.
It doesn't really matter.

You know what happens now.

492
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:10,890
In her current condition…

493
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:15,102
she will be lucky to last a month.

494
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,690
[sighs]

495
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,237
[rain pattering]

496
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:42,630
Did you have a shower this morning?

497
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,218
No, I didn't, sir.

498
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:51,847
Why?

499
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,476
Do I look that bad?

500
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,647
This filthy bastard.

501
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,865
[slurping]

502
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,788
[Sang-gil] Come on, Captain Park,
let's have it,

503
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,666
or did you come all the way for this, huh?

504
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:21,460
Cheap old noodles. We can do better, huh?

505
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,045
I told you I'd pay the tab.

506
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,881
Why not let me treat you
to something better?

507
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:28,008
Well, a government employee
can't be seen accepting

508
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,511
something that could be
construed as a bribe.

509
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,138
[Captain Park] Can you pass the vinegar?

510
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:33,139
[Sang-gil] Sure.

511
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:35,558
[gobbles loudly]

512
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:40,312
[burps]

513
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,442
Why aren't you eating?

514
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,110
[Sang-gil] Ah, leave him be, huh.

515
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:49,822
It's really better this way.
Less mess when I cut him open.

516
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,490
How considerate.

517
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,534
Less shit for my boys to clean up.

518
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:56,579
[Captain Park chuckles]
Must you speak so ghastly.

519
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:58,164
All right then,

520
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:00,207
since he has lost his appetite,

521
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,751
we'll talk sharp instead, okay.

522
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,921
So I heard, Chairman Doh survived.

523
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:06,881
What if he did?

524
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,175
He's been left a cripple. Shit.

525
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,470
Fortunately, he was religious, huh.

526
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:16,307
Donated a lot of money to church,
attended all their services.

527
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,809
[chuckles]
I guess the heavens spared him.

528
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:21,312
Fucking Hallelujah, right?

529
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:24,315
The heavens, my ass.
The doctor that saved him.

530
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:25,733
[chuckles]

531
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,610
So considering,

532
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:30,821
Chairman Doh survived the ambush,

533
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:34,408
and as I hear, a couple of Mr. Yang's men
already paid…

534
00:41:34,491 --> 00:41:36,577
[clicks tongue]
…the ultimate price.

535
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,580
[Captain Park] Don't you think Bukseong's
had enough retribution?

536
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,290
We should consider… [exhales]

537
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:43,667
…calling it even.

538
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:46,962
Ahh, let's see.

539
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,423
No, absolutely not, huh.

540
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:52,468
Your math simply doesn't square.

541
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:57,306
It's not that easy. This isn't a score
that can be settled so cheaply.

542
00:41:58,474 --> 00:41:59,892
[Do-soo] Let's be honest.

543
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,647
You people were the ones
who started all this.

544
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,482
Oh? You sure?

545
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,902
Sorry, for a second there,
I almost thought it mattered

546
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:11,695
what the fuck you had to say.
[clatters]

547
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,656
-You shit.
-[Captain Park] Ah, Director Ma.

548
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:15,282
What's with you?

549
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,284
Allow me to do my job.

550
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,328
Let's resolve this peacefully.

551
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:22,122
If you keep killing each other,
I'm gonna lose my job.

552
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,415
[chuckles]

553
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:26,293
I even got an earful about it
before coming here today.

554
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:30,339
They say I'm too lenient
on worthless thugs.

555
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:33,676
My fucking evaluations are coming up.

556
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,554
[scoffs] So I say…

557
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,932
enough is enough, all right?

558
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:45,145
[clears throat]

559
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,731
Look, Captain Park.

560
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:54,196
Respectfully, this isn't even something
you can really intervene in, huh.

561
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,699
[Sang-gil] They attempted
to assassinate my boss.

562
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:59,076
The chairman of the great Bukseong gang

563
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:02,663
was shanked by some lowlife punk
that he himself ordered.

564
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:07,710
And so, how could we possible just let
something like this slide, huh?

565
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,505
This is such a fucking
goddamn embarrassment.

566
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,300
I can't even hold my head up
when I walk down the street.

567
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:15,426
Fuck.

568
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,721
[sighs] Goddammit.

569
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:21,473
[Sang-gil grunts, clears throat]

570
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:25,436
You stupid fucking piece of shit.

571
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:28,397
Yeah, Ma Sang-gil.

572
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:30,691
Come on.

573
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,528
[Captain Park] What do you think
you're gonna do about it?

574
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,281
-Captain Park…
-Shut your mouth, you worthless cunt.

575
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:39,074
I'm speaking here!

576
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,080
Yeah.

577
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:48,292
You think…

578
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:51,420
because we're sitting here,
eating noodles together,

579
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:53,714
that we're buddies or something, huh?

580
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,216
You think I'm a joke, huh?

581
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,301
Yeah?

582
00:43:57,384 --> 00:44:00,763
Let me remind you that there are lines
that cannot be crossed.

583
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,891
[Captain Park]
I told you my evaluations are coming up.

584
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:09,229
And if I miss this promotion,
will you take the blame, huh?

585
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,315
You think that just because
I'm being nice to you,

586
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:13,525
that I'm gonna let you walk
all over me, huh?

587
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,694
It's as if you're challenging me.
[chuckles]

588
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,321
Huh? That it?

589
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:18,989
Maybe, I should do my job, eh,

590
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,491
and put your asses in jail!

591
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:22,493
Of course not, sir, I apologize.

592
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,620
What about you, Sang-gil?

593
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:44,598
[exhales]

594
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,643
Are you finished, Captain Park, huh?

595
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:48,811
You fuckers.

596
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:50,479
You have anything more to add?

597
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:54,650
[sighs] I don't know.

598
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:58,362
I just hate seeing you
get all worked up like this, huh.

599
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,823
And aren't you always the one…

600
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:04,410
constantly preaching to us
about mutual respect?

601
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:07,454
Shit. You need to be smart about this.

602
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:12,167
You know that Yang has people
higher up than me on his payroll.

603
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:17,631
If you were to cause him physical harm,

604
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:19,842
it would be trouble for both of us.

605
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:22,136
[Captain Park] So that's off the table.

606
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,389
Director Ma, I'll beg you if you'd ask.

607
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:27,516
[Captain Park]
It's not like we're strangers here.

608
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:31,019
I know we can find a way
to get along, huh?

609
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:33,522
[tense music playing]

610
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,449
[clears throat]

611
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,536
All right, huh?

612
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:49,705
What's the deal then?

613
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,511
[exhales]

614
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:17,274
-[Jae-yeon coughs]
-You're awake.

615
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:19,026
What are you doing here?

616
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:22,070
[Tae-gu] Kuto had to meet
some customers at the farm.

617
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,906
Hey, what are you doing?

618
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:25,741
Hang on. Wait, I wouldn't…

619
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:26,867
Oh, jeez.

620
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:35,626
-[sighs]
-You can look, kid. I won't charge you.

621
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:45,344
[sighs] As if someone would pay for that.

622
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,025
You have something to ask me?

623
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:03,654
What?

624
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,907
No, not really. Nope.

625
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:08,283
[clears throat]

626
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:11,286
Why do you look at me like that?

627
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,872
Do I look different to you now?

628
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,542
[Jae-yeon]
Now that you know I'm a dead girl?

629
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:30,639
What?

630
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,352
Wanna grab lunch?

631
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,650
Aren't you hungry?

632
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:46,154
Well, are you?

633
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:48,824
No, not really hungry.

634
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,034
[clears throat]

635
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:55,956
[Jae-yeon]
I hope you're not afraid of raw fish.

636
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:58,834
This place makes the best <i>mulhoe</i> soup.

637
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:03,130
Folks from the mainland don't know
about this place yet. It's nice and quiet.

638
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:06,049
I've made peace with dying.

639
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:09,803
But I'll definitely miss the <i>mulhoe</i>
from this place.

640
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,851
-[Jae-yeon] Thank you, ma'am.
-[waitress] Mm-hm.

641
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:18,562
-Please enjoy.
-[Jae-yeon] Yeah.

642
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:21,106
This is the best.

643
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:27,154
[moans]

644
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:33,035
[munching]

645
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,413
I guess this isn't your kind of food?

646
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,875
Too spicy for you?

647
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:43,837
[Jae-yeon] Or is it the smell?

648
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:45,964
No worries, kid.

649
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:49,301
That's your prerogative.

650
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:53,347
[moaning]

651
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:01,813
I'll make this better.

652
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:04,191
Excuse me, one bottle of Hallasan.

653
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,115
Hm?

654
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:17,788
God, everything is a struggle with you.

655
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:19,498
Unbelievable.

656
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:31,677
[sighs]

657
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:35,681
[grunts]

658
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:37,307
You're good with a pistol.

659
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,396
That was nothing.

660
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:47,234
It was easy.

661
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,070
All I do is imagine
the one I want to kill.

662
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:52,990
[Jae-yeon] Also…

663
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:56,368
I feel safer carrying it.

664
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,623
Sure you don't want to drink it?

665
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:05,002
It's a crime to visit Jeju
and not try this.

666
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:07,504
Come on, just a sip.

667
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:17,723
It's good, right?

668
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:19,433
Isn't it?

669
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,728
Cheers then. Drink up.

670
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:25,355
No, thanks. I shouldn't,
I'm the one who has to drive us back.

671
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:26,857
Ah, nonsense.

672
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,317
You can handle one shot, kid.

673
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:31,361
Hm?

674
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:35,365
Besides, the cops don't check
for DUIs here.

675
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:39,036
I've lived here my whole life
and I've never once seen a DUI checkpoint.

676
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:41,413
[Jae-yeon] That's not a thing here.

677
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:43,623
So no worries. Drink up.

678
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:47,794
[groans]

679
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:50,756
[dialing]

680
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:52,841
Dispatch, Kim Hyeong-jin.

681
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:56,803
Kim Hyeong-jin. November 11th, 1987.

682
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,722
-Listed as local resident…
-Let's do this again.

683
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:01,475
You're going to blow
like you're inflating a balloon.

684
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:02,684
It's 5626.

685
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:03,935
Blow.

686
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:07,564
Blow, blow, blow…

687
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,732
You're good.

688
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,075
[officer 1] And him?

689
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:19,534
Yeah, he's fine, sir.

690
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:21,286
That's good. Just a sip like he says.

691
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:23,371
Thanks for your cooperation.

692
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:26,166
[officer 1] All right, drive safe.

693
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:27,667
Yeah.

694
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:31,046
Hang on, please stop, sir.

695
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,924
[officer 2] Oh… oh, off the road.
Please try to stand up.

696
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:35,801
Will you… your girlfriend.

697
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:37,844
She had way too much to drink.

698
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,638
[officer 3] Get her under control.

699
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:40,972
-Stop this.
-Please help!

700
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:42,516
[whining] I promise to be good.

701
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:45,852
[officer 3] Wow, look at her.
She must've drank her own body weight.

702
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,647
[moans, groans]

703
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:50,816
[officer 3] Help her back on to her feet.

704

-[indistinct chatter]
-[moans]

Hey, hey, hey.

706
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,322
Oh, oh, oh, no, no!

707
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:58,990
-No, no, no…

[Do-soo]
<i>I'll be there to meet you tomorrow.</i>

710
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:26,810
<i>So be ready to leave.</i>

711
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,562
<i>I don't need to remind you,</i>

712
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:30,647
<i>no trace of you</i>
<i>should be left behind, all right?</i>

713
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:31,815
I understand.

714
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:37,821
You know, sir. I haven't been able
to get a hold of Jin-sung or my guys.

715
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:40,198
[Do-soo sighs] <i>Yeah, that.</i>

716
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:41,616
<i>Uh, shit.</i>

717
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,911
<i>You probably guessed by now,</i>
<i>but the operation failed.</i>

718
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:47,163
<i>The Bukseong gang demolished us.</i>

719
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:49,791
<i>Jin-sung and the boys</i>
<i>are already in hiding,</i>

00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:55,213
<i>I'll fill you in on everything tomorrow.</i>

722
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:56,965
<i>Get ready to meet me.</i>

723
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:58,758
Yeah, all right, sir.

724
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:07,183
[sighs sharply]

725
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:09,895
[ominous music]

726
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:22,699
[Captain Park]
Imagine this as Park Tae-gu.

727
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:26,161
Park Tae-gu is the one
who butchered Chairman Doh.

728
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:29,581
As an apology, you hand over Park Tae-gu.

729
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:35,003
Just like this.

730
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:38,006
Over to Bukseong…

731
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:41,676
and Bukseong deals with Park Tae-gu
how they like.

732
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:46,890
And we will all agree with Park Tae-gu
who is acting entirely on his own,

733
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:48,850
who did this.

734
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:50,685
We end it there.

735
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:52,896
Are we good?

736
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,360
-[sighs]
-[Captain Park] Okay, now…

737
00:53:58,443 --> 00:54:01,571
Once that filthy assassin
who had the unmitigated gall

738
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:03,865
to flash a knife
in front of your Chairman Doh

739
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:06,243
is dealt with by Director Ma…

740
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:12,916
[Captain Park] Tae-gu is handed back

741
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:15,543
and the cleanup will be done
by Yang and his men.

742
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:18,797
Good? And I expect him
to disappear without a trace.

743
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:21,758
If anything of him is ever found,

744
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:24,261
Mr. Yang will assume all of the blame.

745
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:25,637
Okay?

746
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:29,724
Understood.

747
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:32,727
All right, Director Ma,
are you happy with the terms?

748
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:36,147
Well, I don't find it fully satisfying…

749
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:39,359
but I'll agree to it.

750
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:41,027
[Captain Park] All right then…

751
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:44,239
There better not be any loose ends.

752
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:47,075
Understand what I mean?

753
00:54:48,326 --> 00:54:49,661
We're in agreement?

754
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:53,957
-Yes.
-[Captain Park] Okay.

755
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:09,931
[Jae-yeon] I'm wondering about…

756
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:14,019
what you did that was so bad
that they sent you here.

757
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:22,319
Right? You must've done
something pretty bad in Seoul.

758
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:23,862
Didn't you?

759
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:26,323
Hey, cut it out.

760
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:29,617
Vladivostok, Russia.

761
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:32,829
To be sent there,
you must've fucked up pretty bad.

762
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:35,957
Do you wanna spill the beans?

763
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,667
Come on, stop.

764
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,629
Ah…

765
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:44,966
So I'm not the only one to receive
a death sentence.

766
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,343
You're dead too.

767

769
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:53,558
I said stop.

770
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:57,103
I asked you to cut it out.
Is that something you can respect?

771
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:00,523
I knew it.

772
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:02,484
Death sentence.

773
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:04,944
It all adds up.

774
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:08,323
You fucked things up,
and you ran off to save your ass.

775
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:10,075
Okay, say that again.

It's all right with me.

779
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:26,174
I can take it, kid.

Take your best shot.

782
00:56:28,384 --> 00:56:30,470
I don't understand
why you're doing this to me.

783
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:31,971
What did I do to you?

784
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:36,935
Whatever. Go ahead and drive, kid.

785
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:40,230
Uncle will be waiting. [exhales]

I don't know why you keep calling me kid.

I'm older than you.

791
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:05,588
Show some respect.

792
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:07,632
You're the one who started it.

793
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:11,761
So, how old are you?

794
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:14,472
Oh, so now you're an old geezer.

795
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:17,058
What's with people demanding respect
because they're older?

796
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:20,854
All you've done is have
a few more meals to me.

797
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:23,231
Anyway, you may have been born before me,

798
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:25,066
but I'm likely to die before you.

799
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,735
That should even things out.

800
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:29,737
If you don't like it, die first.

It's all there.

805

If you're done shopping, head out.

806
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:02,187
I have someplace to be.

807

[boss] I'm curious, though.

808
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,441
Is this all the merchandise you have?

809
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:08,318
I already told you that it was.

810
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:10,403
[boss] But, is that the truth?

811
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:13,907
Watch how you speak.

Hey, don't be so serious,

So am I. You heard what he said.

1303
01:36:25,613 --> 01:36:26,739
I'm dead either way.

1304
01:36:33,704 --> 01:36:35,456
Besides, you hate being alone.

1305
01:36:36,457 --> 01:36:38,626
[Tae-gu] <i>Just hold on, I'll be there soon.</i>

1306
01:36:48,469 --> 01:36:50,262
[Sang-gil] An hour isn't very long.

1307
01:36:52,056 --> 01:36:54,600
I don't have much patience
for those who show up late.

1308
01:36:56,268 --> 01:36:59,480
But if you do show up on time,
you get a reward.

1309
01:37:00,439 --> 01:37:02,691
Think of it as a going away present.

1310
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:04,735
And when you get it…

1311
01:37:04,818 --> 01:37:06,445
[chuckles]

1312
01:37:06,529 --> 01:37:07,780
…you're gonna thank me.

1313
01:37:32,972 --> 01:37:34,181
You remember meeting me?

1314
01:37:34,890 --> 01:37:37,184
You were only this high
last time I saw you.

1315
01:37:38,269 --> 01:37:39,770
Now, you're all grown up.

1316
01:37:40,813 --> 01:37:42,147
[chuckles]

1317
01:37:44,316 --> 01:37:45,442
Do you remember now?

1318
01:37:45,526 --> 01:37:47,570
[scoffs]
Are you fucking kidding me?

1319
01:37:49,196 --> 01:37:51,198
Do you think I remember
every slimeball I meet?

1320
01:37:53,033 --> 01:37:54,785
[laughs]

1321
01:37:56,620 --> 01:37:59,081
Oh, you really are a mouthy little thing.

1322
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:04,211
Oh my, haven't you been taught
to respect your elders?

1323
01:38:04,295 --> 01:38:05,838
You have to earn my respect.

1324
01:38:07,089 --> 01:38:08,507
And you haven't earned shit.

1325
01:38:10,968 --> 01:38:12,428
You must wanna die.

1326
01:38:12,511 --> 01:38:13,470
Kill me.

1327
01:38:14,471 --> 01:38:16,140
Whether it's today or tomorrow,

1328
01:38:16,807 --> 01:38:18,017
I'll be dead anyway.

1329
01:38:20,644 --> 01:38:22,855
Oh, this girl's got no respect for life.

1330
01:38:24,315 --> 01:38:26,066
How'd you end up with that outlook, huh?

1331
01:38:27,484 --> 01:38:31,196
Whoa! Kuto did one hell of a job
raising you, little one.

1332
01:38:36,243 --> 01:38:38,787
[dramatic music playing]

1333
01:39:13,739 --> 01:39:16,367
[dramatic music continues]

1334
01:39:49,108 --> 01:39:50,275
[groans]

1335
01:39:54,405 --> 01:39:56,573
[grunting]

1336
01:39:59,827 --> 01:40:01,245
You fucking bastard!

1337
01:40:01,829 --> 01:40:02,705
[groans]

1338
01:40:03,497 --> 01:40:05,082
[grunts]

1339
01:40:05,666 --> 01:40:08,127
-[henchman 11] Who are we kidding here?
-[henchman 12] Asshole!

1340
01:40:08,210 --> 01:40:09,253
[henchman 13] Fucker!

1341
01:40:12,005 --> 01:40:13,173
Son of a bitch!

1342
01:40:13,257 --> 01:40:15,634
[panting]

1343
01:40:17,970 --> 01:40:19,388
Welcome, asshole.

1344
01:40:19,471 --> 01:40:21,390
[henchman 11]
Park Tae-gu, you piece of shit.

1345
01:40:33,193 --> 01:40:34,820
[door opens]

1346
01:40:44,872 --> 01:40:45,873
[Sang-gil] You're here.

1347
01:40:48,751 --> 01:40:49,752
Look.

1348
01:40:59,595 --> 01:41:01,054
Are you okay?

1349
01:41:04,641 --> 01:41:05,851
Yeah, I'm fine.

1350
01:41:08,062 --> 01:41:09,188
You okay?

1351
01:41:10,314 --> 01:41:12,983
[groans] Do I look okay to you?

1352
01:41:13,067 --> 01:41:14,234
[chuckles]

1353
01:41:18,864 --> 01:41:19,740
No.

1354
01:41:21,700 --> 01:41:22,951
You know what,

1355
01:41:24,661 --> 01:41:27,748
I hate it when people ask if I'm okay

1356
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:31,585
when they know that I'm clearly not.

1357
01:41:34,046 --> 01:41:35,422
[chuckles]

1358
01:41:43,347 --> 01:41:44,348
But…

1359
01:41:45,474 --> 01:41:47,184
it's nice of you to ask.

1360
01:41:49,228 --> 01:41:52,064
Okay, what is this situation
I'm watching here, huh?

1361
01:41:53,982 --> 01:41:56,068
Has there been something brewing
between you two?

1362
01:41:58,654 --> 01:42:00,197
Are you boyfriend and girlfriend?

1363
01:42:00,781 --> 01:42:01,698
What if we are?

1364
01:42:01,782 --> 01:42:03,826
[Jae-yeon] Is it your business, asshole?

1365
01:42:04,493 --> 01:42:06,120
There's her classy mouth again.

1366
01:42:06,954 --> 01:42:08,163
[sighs]

1367
01:42:09,706 --> 01:42:11,375
Make the call, you fucker.

1368
01:42:12,042 --> 01:42:15,629
Let Jin-sung go,
just like you promised me.

1369
01:42:16,505 --> 01:42:17,506
[scoffs]

1370
01:42:19,550 --> 01:42:22,803
And now, we have another mouthy one here.
[scoffs]

1371
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:25,180
Don't you have any manners?

1372
01:42:26,223 --> 01:42:29,059
I guess, these days,
no one respects their elders.

1373
01:42:29,935 --> 01:42:30,936
[sighs]

1374
01:42:31,019 --> 01:42:33,021
Ah, whatever. Whatever.

1375
01:42:33,105 --> 01:42:35,816
You're gonna be dead soon,
anyway. Shit.

1376
01:42:35,899 --> 01:42:38,944
Hey, call the hospital and let him go.

1377
01:42:39,027 --> 01:42:40,112
[henchman 11] Yes, sir.

1378
01:42:41,655 --> 01:42:44,783
[Sang-gil] Ah, kids these days
are so disrespectful.

1379
01:42:49,746 --> 01:42:52,040
-[groans]
-Hold still.

1380
01:42:52,624 --> 01:42:54,835
[choking]

1381
01:43:01,466 --> 01:43:03,135
[whispers]
Somebody already got him.

1382
01:43:05,304 --> 01:43:06,305
Huh?

1383
01:43:07,389 --> 01:43:09,266
What the fuck are you saying to me?

1384
01:43:10,058 --> 01:43:11,226
Huh?

1385
01:43:13,562 --> 01:43:14,730
Hey, Yang.

1386
01:43:16,565 --> 01:43:18,025
Really? Huh?

1387
01:43:19,276 --> 01:43:21,278
You went in and had Tae-gu's men killed?

1388
01:43:23,864 --> 01:43:25,866
Well, we needed to get him anyway.

1389
01:43:25,949 --> 01:43:28,994
No reason to risk him,
causing problems for us or anything.

1390
01:43:29,077 --> 01:43:31,663
-Are you fucking kidding?
-[Do-soo] Mr. Ma! Hold on! Come on!

1391
01:43:31,747 --> 01:43:33,165
[Sang-gil] Goddamn!

1392
01:43:33,749 --> 01:43:37,044
-[Do-soo] Hold on a second.
-I'm gonna spill your guts all over.

1393
01:43:37,127 --> 01:43:40,505
-[Do-soo] Ma, I'm sorry. Don't kill me.
-I made a promise to him.

1394
01:43:40,589 --> 01:43:42,799
Please forgive me.
Forgive me just this once.

1395
01:43:42,883 --> 01:43:44,927
Hey, remember what Captain Park said?

1396
01:43:45,010 --> 01:43:47,346
Remember what Captain Park said?
Killing me is a bad idea.

1397
01:43:47,429 --> 01:43:50,265
It'll make trouble for everyone.
Okay, listen to me, huh?

1398
01:43:50,349 --> 01:43:52,893
Jin-sung, he was loyal
to take him to a fault.

1399
01:43:52,976 --> 01:43:54,603
There's no telling what he would do.

1400
01:43:54,686 --> 01:43:57,147
We couldn't risk keeping him alive.

1401
01:43:57,231 --> 01:43:59,149
I did the right thing by killing him.

1402
01:43:59,232 --> 01:44:00,484
I did it for us.

1403
01:44:01,068 --> 01:44:03,028
You fucking son of a bitch, Yang!

1404
01:44:03,654 --> 01:44:05,364
You motherfucker!

1405
01:44:05,447 --> 01:44:07,324
[grunts angrily]

1406
01:44:07,407 --> 01:44:08,533
How could you do that?

1407
01:44:09,076 --> 01:44:10,702
-How could you fucking do that?
-This shit.

1408
01:44:10,786 --> 01:44:11,995
[Tae-gu] I'm gonna kill you.

1409
01:44:12,079 --> 01:44:14,164
-Oh, this asshole…
-[metal clatters]

1410
01:44:14,915 --> 01:44:16,792
You need to watch how you talk to me.

1411
01:44:16,875 --> 01:44:18,293
[Tae-gu] You bastard!

1412
01:44:19,086 --> 01:44:22,422
You need to check yourself
before you start cursing other people.

1413
01:44:22,506 --> 01:44:25,133
[Do-soo] Keep in mind,
this is all your fault.

1414
01:44:25,217 --> 01:44:26,843
None of this would've happened,

1415
01:44:27,469 --> 01:44:30,639
if you hadn't attacked Chairman Doh
in the first place, huh?

1416
01:44:31,306 --> 01:44:33,267
Oh, hey, Yang Do-soo!

1417
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:35,519
Yang Do-soo, I'll kill you!

1418
01:44:35,602 --> 01:44:38,105
[Tae-gu] Yang Do-soo, I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!

1419
01:44:38,188 --> 01:44:40,107
Looks like you haven't had enough yet.

1420
01:44:41,275 --> 01:44:43,360
-[Do-soo] You shit!
-[Jae-yeon] No! Stop!

1421
01:44:44,027 --> 01:44:45,821
Don't hit him! Stop! Stop!

1422
01:44:45,904 --> 01:44:48,532
[Do-soo] Did I tell you to do it?
Did I order it, huh?

1423
01:44:48,615 --> 01:44:50,993
-[Jae-yeon] Stop!
-I never told you to do a thing!

1424
01:44:51,076 --> 01:44:53,078
Son of a bitch! [grunts]

1425
01:44:53,161 --> 01:44:55,330
[Jae-yeon wailing]

1426
01:44:55,414 --> 01:44:57,749
-Stop!
-She's right. Come on, enough.

1427
01:44:58,834 --> 01:45:00,460
[Sang-gil] That's enough.

1428
01:45:01,420 --> 01:45:03,630
Oh, shit. He's gonna kill the damn kid.

1429
01:45:03,714 --> 01:45:05,632
[grunts]

1430
01:45:05,716 --> 01:45:07,592
[Jae-yeon] Please, stop!

1431
01:45:07,676 --> 01:45:10,053
-Please!
-Yes, you shit now, you fucking…

1432
01:45:10,137 --> 01:45:12,222
Oh, hey! [groans]

1433
01:45:16,184 --> 01:45:18,312
[groans] Ah, fuck, that hurts.

1434
01:45:19,313 --> 01:45:21,148
[Do-soo groaning]

1435
01:45:22,357 --> 01:45:23,525
[clears throat]

1436
01:45:27,112 --> 01:45:28,530
This guy is really something, huh?

1437
01:45:29,156 --> 01:45:31,116
Real fucking piece of work, huh?

1438
01:45:31,992 --> 01:45:33,827
He's barely even human, isn't he?

1439
01:45:35,037 --> 01:45:37,539
He's more like a cockroach,
this fucking guy.

1440
01:45:41,418 --> 01:45:43,378
[groaning]

1441
01:45:46,673 --> 01:45:48,050
Ah, shit.

1442
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:51,970
I told you to stop, didn't I? You asshole.

1443
01:45:54,264 --> 01:45:55,640
[claps]

1444
01:45:56,808 --> 01:45:57,851
Hey, Tae-gu!

1445
01:45:58,560 --> 01:45:59,603
Tae-gu.

1446
01:46:00,854 --> 01:46:02,064
Remember the gift…

1447
01:46:03,065 --> 01:46:04,733
I promised you earlier?

1448
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:07,361
I have information
that should interest you.

1449
01:46:12,282 --> 01:46:14,493
It's about your dead sister.

1450
01:46:17,454 --> 01:46:19,664
[Sang-gil]
Chairman Doh had me investigate.

1451
01:46:19,748 --> 01:46:22,459
I assumed we were involved,
so I roughed up my own guys,

1452
01:46:22,542 --> 01:46:24,211
really grilling them hard.

1453
01:46:24,294 --> 01:46:25,379
Turns out…

1454
01:46:26,254 --> 01:46:27,756
it wasn't us after all.

1455
01:46:28,799 --> 01:46:29,925
It's true.

1456
01:46:31,301 --> 01:46:33,303
[Sang-gil] Yeah, just think about it, huh?

1457
01:46:33,387 --> 01:46:35,597
Even if we saw you
as some kind of obstacle,

1458
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:37,974
we wouldn't dishonor ourselves
with dirty tactics.

1459
01:46:39,226 --> 01:46:40,352

Well, Yang, speak up.

[Sang-gil] You care to tell him
what happened to his sister and niece?

1465
01:46:54,825 --> 01:46:56,326
He has some questions.

[Sang-gil] Isn't it obvious, huh?

1470
01:47:08,964 --> 01:47:12,342
Chairman Doh had poached everyone
from him and was recruiting you.

1471
01:47:13,135 --> 01:47:14,845
He was worried that you would leave

1472
01:47:14,928 --> 01:47:16,888
and that you would take
your boys with you.

1473
01:47:17,931 --> 01:47:20,350
And then, he'd be left all alone and weak.
