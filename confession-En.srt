Mr. Yoo Min-ho? I'm Attorney Yang Shin-ae.

24
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,438
Hello.

25
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:17,734
Attorney Jang called me.
He said you were hurrying over.

26
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:21,279
I was heading to the hotel
when I received new info.

27
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:24,240
It couldn't wait
until our meeting tomorrow morning.

28
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,952
Can I come in?

29
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,996
Thanks.

30
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,707
I guess Attorney Jang is busy.

31
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,793
He'll be here as soon as he can. This way.

32
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,715
You must be tired
from the all-night interrogation.

33
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,300
This is a long way away.

34
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,470
I had to escape the press.

35
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:50,224
I don't know about the press,
but the prosecution is watching you.

36
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:53,061
Policemen are stationed
five minutes from here.

38
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,276
Coffee okay?

39
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,051
This is the chairman's family cabin?

40
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,136
It used to be.

41
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,849
His wife's family graves were nearby,
but since they were moved, no one comes.

42
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,019
Just me sometimes, to clear my head.

43
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,611
Thank you for taking on the defense.

44
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,117
Let me be clear.

45
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:53,621
I'll decide whether to do it
after hearing the whole story.

46
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,833
And it's the chairman you should thank.

47
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,002
I never imagined
the warrant would be nullified.

48
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:05,967
The prosecution obtained
game-changing evidence.

49
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,053
A new arrest warrant
could be issued at dawn.

50
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,517
Arrest warrant? But I didn't kill her.

51
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,561
The prosecution thinks otherwise.

52
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:24,110
-What do you think?
-I read your testimony.

53
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:27,655
There are too many holes in your story.
Let's hear it from the beginning.

54
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,332
How long were you seeing Kim Se-hee?

55
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:42,837
It started about a year ago,
but it ended last fall.

56
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,881
So why did you see her again?

57
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,637
<i>I received a blackmail threat
that morning.</i>

58
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,224
<i>I had to pay one billion won
or they'd reveal the affair.</i>

59
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:59,687
<i>I didn't have that much cash on me,
so I took what I had.</i>

60
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,900
Checking in?

61
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,818
Room 514, please.

62
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,989
Your guest has already gone
up to the room.

63
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,332
<i>I was unaware that we'd both received
the same threat.</i>

64
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:24,045
<i>They'd said to wait in the room,
so we did.</i>

65
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:29,258
-Had you been there with Se-hee before?
-No.

66
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,220
Why would they want you
at such a remote place?

67
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,805
Does that matter?

68
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:38,017
You must explain all the details
to get an innocent verdict.

69
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,477
Why didn't you report it?

70
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:45,024
The affair was already over…
and I didn't want my wife to know.

71
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,860
You have a lot to lose
if your affair were revealed, yes?

72
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,737
I never thought of it that way.

73
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:52,740
Please continue.

74
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,336
<i>We waited for about an hour.</i>

75
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:17,682
What's going on?

76
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,020
Something's not right.

77
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:26,983
Let's get out of here.

78
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,962
<i>When I woke up,
I heard knocking on the door.</i>

79
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:00,349
Excuse me, sir?

80
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,689
Are you in there?

81
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,781
Sir, this is the police.

82
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,409
Please open the door.

83
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:25,750
This is the police. Open the door!

84
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:36,302
We're responding to a call.
Are you in there?

85
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,731
Se-hee! Se-hee!

86
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,317
Se-hee, wake up.

87
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,406
Help!

88
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,202
Help!

89
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,038
Se-hee…

90
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,917
Freeze!

91
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,627
Hands up!

92
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,212
Slowly.

93
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,631
Slowly, step back.

94
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:14,882
Come out!

95
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,343
It wasn't me.

96
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,887
-I didn't do this.
-Step outside.

97
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,018
-Don't move!
-I said it wasn't me.

98
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,729
-Don't move!
-Someone else was here!

99
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,189
Stay still!

100
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:32,858
Don't move!

101
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,111
Someone else is here!

102
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,907
Someone else is here!

103
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,208
According to police records,

104
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:53,254
a housekeeper was outside room 514
at that time,

105
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,881
<i>but she didn't see anyone exit the room.</i>

106
00:11:55,965 --> 00:12:00,177
<i>Besides, it's impossible to leave the room
with the door chain locked.</i>

107
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:05,766
<i>So the only place left is the balcony,
but that too was locked from the inside.</i>

108
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:10,104
<i>They checked every possible
means of entry and found nothing.</i>

109
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,983
<i>The police see this
as a locked-room crime,</i>

110
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,278
<i>so if your testimony is true,</i>

111
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:20,114
<i>did the criminal
just vanish from the crime scene?</i>

112
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,118
I don't know.

113
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:27,288
-How did he get in?
-Must've been inside already.

114
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:31,542
This is all a conspiracy
to make me look like the culprit.

115
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,544
-Who?
-I don't know.

116
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,130
The police should catch him.

117
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:39,216
You need more than intelligence
to create good testimony.

118
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,051
You need creativity.

119
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,721
Your testimony has no creativity.

120
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,683
I'm telling the truth.
Why do I need creativity?

121
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:54,190
According to your testimony, you're
the only one who saw a third person.

122
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,151
You're obviously the criminal.

123
00:12:58,652 --> 00:12:59,904
Ms. Yang.

124
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,531
It wasn't me.

125
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,075
I didn't do it.

126
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,499
MANAGER HAN SEUNG-YOON

127
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,419
Hello?

128
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,214
Is that confirmed?

129
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,425
Yes.

130
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,261
Yes.

131
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,764
Okay, then.

132
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,852
I found out what the new evidence is.

133
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:36,148
The name of a witness at the crime scene.

134
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,400
How is that possible?

135
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,445
-You called it a locked-room crime.
-That's right.

136
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,657
There can't be any witnesses
to Kim Se-hee's murder.

137
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:50,454
Then what crime did the prosecution's
new witness see?

138
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,874
I don't follow.

139
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:02,007
My clients typically fall into two groups.

140
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,595
Some clients confess and cooperate.

141
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:11,850
And some think they can go free
without a drop of blood on their hands.

142
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,440
MISSING PERSON

143
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:25,322
If you didn't recognize him,
you would've looked closer.

144
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,951
You glanced away quickly,
so you know this person.

145
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:35,499
Is the new witness connected
to this missing persons case?

146
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:41,714
If your lawyer doesn't know what
the prosecution knows, it's a lost cause.

147
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,760
I need to know everything
to rebut the witness's testimony.

148
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,596
Tell me.

149
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,772
If you keep wasting time,

150
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:02,026
the prosecution will have the upper hand
and you'll be arrested.

151
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,946
MISSING PERSON

152
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,412
It was two months ago.

153
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,457
JI-YEON

154
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,963
Hi, honey.

155
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,549
-<i>Where are you?</i>
-Busan.

156
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:29,720
-<i>Everything okay?</i>
-Conferences are all the same.

157
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:33,265
-Discussions, meetings…
-<i>You sound tired.</i>

158
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,727
You'll be fine.

159
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,605
Dad expects great things from you.

160
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:44,276
Doesn't he expect a grandchild
more than anything?

161
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,321
How about we meet face-to-face?

162
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,115
Coming to the opening today?

163
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,035
Are the preparations going well?

164
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,703
<i>Please answer the question.</i>

165
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,580
<i>You're coming, right?</i>

166
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,542
<i>Hello?</i>

167
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,670
Hello?

168
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,964
Sorry, what did you say?

169
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,799
<i>When will you leave?</i>

170
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,678
As soon as I finish up here.

171
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,555
-<i>Hurry, I miss you.</i>
-Me too.

172
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:20,813
-Are you leaving already?
-It's late.

173
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:27,820
Stay a bit longer. You're not sober yet.

174
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,364
Drive for me, will you?

175
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,783
<i>The two of you came here?</i>

176
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,536
<i>We had no other place to go unnoticed.</i>

177
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,832
<i>Se-hee liked it here,
but I felt uncomfortable.</i>

178
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,013
-What?
-My bracelet.

179
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:58,142
-I left it at the cabin.
-I'll get it next time.

180
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:21,749
WONGYE-RO ROAD

181
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,334
-Turn right.
-Not the main road?

182
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,129
It's a shortcut. And no cameras.

183
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,643
What's wrong?

184
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,230
I'm tired.

185
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,276
Tired of lying.

186
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,653
You're honest with me.

187
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:56,450
I have to lie to everyone except you.

188
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:05,459
Remember what we said when we first met?

189
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:09,505
Just being together is enough.
That's all we need to think about.

190
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,842
One can't have everything.

191
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,761
So, do you want to choose just one?

192
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,813
I'm not interested in marriage.

193
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:30,192
That's why we're perfect for each other.

194
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,366
You want to end it?

195
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,454
Let's.

196
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:09,815
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

197
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,639
Hello?

198
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,318
Are you okay?

199
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:58,739
Hello?

200
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:15,881
{\an8}-WHERE ARE YOU?
-ALMOST THERE…

201
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,851
What are you doing?

202
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,686
-We have to report it.
-Wait!

203
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,772
There was nothing we could do.

204
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:36,652
He was texting
and not wearing his seat belt.

205
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,196
What does that matter?
The accident was our fault.

206
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,616
We didn't hit him!
He hit the boulder on his own.

207
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:43,700
So what?

208
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,875
You and I aren't supposed to be here now.

209
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,880
If you call the cops, we're finished.

210
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,387
Nobody saw it.

211
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:08,976
-We can just keep driving.
-Don't be absurd.

212
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,019
Listen.

213
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,688
Everything you've accomplished…

214
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,275
your family.

215
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,612
Your family!

216
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,949
What about them?

217
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,743
Huh?

218
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,205
Let's go.

219
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,087
-Why won't it start?
-Come on!

220
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,505
Please, just…

221
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:41,591
Hold on.

222
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,863
Wait.

223
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,308
What are you doing?

224
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:34,978
We're discussing the accident.
I'm the driver of that car.

225
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,272
-What?
-Just follow my lead.

226
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:38,690
You…

227
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,452
Oh, my… You must have had an accident.

228
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:54,247
Yes, an elk jumped out on the road.
Our cars skidded.

229
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,458
Anybody hurt?

230
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,336
No, we're fine.

231
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:14,142
-Sounds like your phone is ringing.
-Must be the insurance company.

232
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,277
KWON MIN-JOON

233
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,321
-WHERE ARE YOU?
-ALMOST THERE…

234
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:27,405
SILENT

235
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,576
You sure you're okay?

236
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:35,789
I'm a bit shaken up, but I'm fine.

237
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:38,416
Well, then…

238
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,892
Yes, please do that.

239
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,231
As quickly as possible.

240
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,612
All set now.

241
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,240
That's a relief. Drive safely.

242
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:11,992
Yes, thank you.

243
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:24,421
You're sure the witness
didn't see the body?

244
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:26,339
I wasn't over there,

245
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,050
so I had to believe Se-hee.

246
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:32,095
-The license plate of the truck?
-I didn't see it.

247
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:35,765
Is the prosecution's new witness
that truck driver?

248
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:38,351
Right now, it seems likely.

249
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,285
Go, quickly.

250
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,330
And you?

251
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,249
I'll figure something out.

252
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,380
As you said, we didn't even hit him.

253
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:10,842
-We can still report it.
-Get rid of this car, and it's over.

254
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:14,930
Then, it's over for us.

255
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,267
Just as you wanted.

256
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,376
<i>I've been haunted by regret.</i>

257
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,966
We shouldn't have been here.

258
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:55,887
If I hadn't turned right,
there would've been no accident.

259
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,182
Nothing would've happened.

260
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:03,144
<i>I thought about what Se-hee said.</i>

261
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,022
"He's already dead.

262
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:10,235
He has no future, but we do."

263
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,281
Then what?

264
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:20,662
<i>After I got rid of the car,
I met Se-hee again.</i>

265
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:36,011
What's wrong?

266
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:37,512
What?

267
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:49,524
<i>For roadside assistance, you must give us
permission to access your location data.</i>

268
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:52,319
<i>Your call may be recorded--</i>

269
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,312
Excuse me. Are you having trouble?

270
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:31,858
I slammed on the break to avoid an elk,
but now the car won't start.

271
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:33,985
You're not hurt?

272
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,196
No, I'm fine.

273
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:38,031
Did you call the insurance?

274
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,327
Not yet. They said it'd take a while.

275
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:48,041
I can take a look. Can you open the hood?

276
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:55,423
I run a car repair shop in the city.

277
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,426
-Just a minute.
-Okay.

278
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:05,225
It's my sister's car.

279
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:09,229
There's a lever down on the left.

280
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,358
Oh, okay.

281
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,785
Just a minute.

282
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:36,714
I don't really see a problem.
The ECU must have reset.

283
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:40,427
Cars have so much electronics.
One error can shut them down.

284
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:47,350
If you want, would you like
to stop by my place?

285
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:50,311
I'll plug in a scanner
and fix the settings.

286
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:56,067
Or should I call a tow truck?

287
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,360
How long will it take?

288
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:00,238
-The tow truck?
-No, to fix it.

289
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:05,702
With travel time, an hour should do it.

290
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,622
Then, could you fix it for me?

291
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,383
Here.

292
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,095
SEHYUN AUTO CENTER
HAN YOUNG-SEOK

293
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,723
You're not from here, are you?
Neither am I.

294
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,560
We moved here when my wife got sick.

295
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:34,814
She had surgery, chemotherapy
and anything else she could,

296
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:37,525
but the treatments are worse on her
than the disease.

297
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:41,988
She got better
after we moved here, though.

298
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:45,742
She's even started working again.

299
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,162
-That's great.
-Yes.

300
00:29:57,378 --> 00:30:00,757
-Producer Lee?
-<i>Se-hee, how's the video coming?</i>

301
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,968
I finished editing and uploaded it
to the cloud. Please check.

302
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,763
-<i>Then when are you coming?</i>
-The thing is…

303
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:12,811
Something came up.
I'll be there as fast as I can. Thank you.

304
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,776
You work in video production?

305
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,447
Yes.

306
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,534
I met my wife at a broadcasting company.

307
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,496
She was a local news reporter
and I drove the broadcast van.

308
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:36,793
Officially, I was the company van driver,
but in practice, I was her manager.

309
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:41,756
I took care of clothes, makeup,
even her food and lodging,

310
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,925
so she just said, let's just get married.

311
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:48,680
She's the type to make up her mind
in less than five seconds.

312
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:53,893
If she hadn't gotten sick,
she'd be an evening news anchor by now.

313
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,908
DIAGNOSTICS, REPAIR INFORMATION

00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,832
Let's see.

316
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:32,181
Oh, my. I woke you.

317
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:34,267
It's all fixed now.

318
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,355
Just a minute.

319
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,234
-How much do I…
-No, no, no.

320
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:46,112
Just consider it a favor.

321
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:51,618
Sorry, I didn't get you anything.
Have some chrysanthemum tea.

322
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:52,911
No, I'm fine.

323
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,538
It won't take a minute. Take it with you.

324
00:31:56,205 --> 00:32:00,084
My son dried the flowers himself.
It's perfect for this weather.

325
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:05,548
That boy put off college
and got a job for himself.

326
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:11,721
Growing up with a sick mother,
I guess he wanted to stay close.

327
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,266
My wife will be home soon.
Join us for dinner.

328
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,602
Oh. Just a minute.

329
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,397
Hi, Min-jun.

330
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,693
Sure, how have you been?

331
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,780
NEWS REPORTER OF THE MONTH
LEE HEE-JUNG

332
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:33,201
Are your parents well? Say hi to them
for me and tell them to come over.

333
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,079
Sun-jae?

334
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:39,916
Of course he left. He went out right away.

335
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,128
He hasn't shown up?
And he's not answering?

336
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,172
That's strange.

337
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:49,759
Let me call you back.

338
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,679
Hello?

339
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,736
DAD

340
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:57,869
DAD

341
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:09,047
Look, my son forgot to take his phone!

342
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,217
I think I'm going to go.

343
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,555
Wait…

344
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,589
So, what should we do now?

345
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,593
I have an idea.

346
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:00,973
But I can't do it by myself.

347
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:06,104
<i>Se-hee told me about her plan.</i>

348
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:10,650
<i>I couldn't believe
she came up with it so quickly.</i>

349
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:13,444
<i>It's as if she'd planned it
her whole life.</i>

350
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,863
<i>The look in her eye scared me.</i>

351
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:20,660
<i>We promised it'd be the last time
we'd see each other, and parted ways.</i>

352
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:54,610
Lastly, let's watch the video
that we prepared.

353
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:59,157
Thank you for coming to the opening
of Ha Seon Art Gallery.

354
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,256
Did you hear it all?

355
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,133
You did great.

356
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:36,319
<i>Somehow we'd succeeded,</i>

357
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:39,280
<i>but I was afraid
I might ruin it all in an instant.</i>

358
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:46,329
What's this about?
You want to junk the car?

359
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:51,792
It's at the construction site.
Make sure it can't be traced.

360
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,338
Why there?

361
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:58,007
It was a simple accident.
I just don't want trouble.

362
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,304
Anything else? Just the car?

363
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:06,098
Please do it.

364
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:15,399
Scrapping it will leave a record.
It's better to strip and export it.

365
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:18,319
If we use a professional,

366
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,947
they won't cause trouble
because their work is illegal.

367
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:25,493
I'm your lawyer.
If you need anything, say it.

368
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:28,412
And just focus on the deal.

369
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:35,836
<i>I couldn't focus on work,
but I also couldn't take days off.</i>

370
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,882
<i>I was preparing to export
my security program to China.</i>

371
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:42,635
<i>The fate of the company depended on it.</i>

372
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,056
Make sure it can't be traced.

373
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:48,432
Don't worry.

374
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:08,953
YOU HAVE A VISITOR
FROM THE POLICE STATION.

375
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,888
At 5:40 p.m. on that day,

376
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:32,435
Han Sun-jae drove out to meet a friend,
and disappeared.

377
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,895
His car vanished as well.

378
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:38,941
Soon after, the kid's father
stopped on his way home

379
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:42,361
to tow and fix a car that had broken down.

380
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:45,573
He said a woman was driving it.

381
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:48,159
Some parts that were found

382
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:51,746
where the car broke down
matched Han Sun-jae's missing car.

383
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:55,416
At the very spot
where the father towed her car,

384
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:58,627
there are signs that a car
struck a boulder.

385
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:01,922
But strangely enough,
the accident was never reported.

386
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,382
So?

387
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:06,552
What does an accident in Gangwon
have to do with us?

388
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:08,971
The site of Han's accident--

389
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,389
You said he's missing.

390
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,517
You can't assume it was him.

391
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:19,190
His presumed accident

392
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,151
matches the location of that woman.

393
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:26,822
Moreover, the boy's father remembered
the car's license plate number.

394
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:32,912
We ran a search on that license plate
and the car belongs to this company.

395
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:37,249
Mostly driven by you, sir.
Isn't that right?

396
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,835
Any employee can drive a company car.

397
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:44,382
And I told you that car has been stolen.

398
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:48,803
We reported it the day after,
after our CEO returned from Busan.

399
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,640
What were you doing in Busan?

400
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,851
There was a conference.

401
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,396
And about the license plate,

402
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:03,317
we can't be sure the father
remembered correctly, can we?

403
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:06,570
Can we see the driver log records
of the company car?

404
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:07,863
How about we stop?

405
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:10,199
Or you can get a warrant.

406
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:12,368
Don't you want to find your stolen car?

407
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:14,537
The Transportation Division will find it.

408
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:19,792
It's not your jurisdiction, so don't
involve my client without evidence.

409
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,339
We're busy, so why don't you go?

410
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:29,802
Let's go.

411
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:53,534
The car looked fine. Why are you
so nervous about a minor accident?

412
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:59,540
I was only in Busan the first day.

413
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:03,627
And the second day?

414
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,464
With that woman?

415
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:14,013
You'll need an alibi, then.

416
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:19,268
And the missing person? Any connection?

417
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:29,820
-Find a truck for me.
-Know the license number?

418
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:33,782
I just know the model,
color and the driver's face.

419
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,953
That'll take time.

420
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:41,874
What about the cops?
What do you think will happen?

421
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:46,670
You saw them. They're not even close
to being able to involve you.

422
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:51,926
<i>So he got me an alibi, and there was
no more contact from the police.</i>

423
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:55,304
<i>I thought it was over,
then the real nightmare started.</i>

424
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:00,059
Daddy wants to go on a trip.
Where should we go?

425
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,978
I'm glad to go anywhere. You decide.

426
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,106
Where should we go?

427
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:11,028
<i>The Han Sun-jae missing persons case
is now a public investigation.</i>

428
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:14,114
<i>Gangwon police and local residents
are combing the area,</i>

429
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:17,326
<i>but the mountainous terrain
is making the search difficult.</i>

430
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:19,119
They still haven't found him.

431
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,830
<i>Police say it may not be
a simple disappearance…</i>

432
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:22,957
Guess not.

433
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:27,253
<i>…but they are waiting
for conclusive evidence.</i>

434
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:30,673
<i>Police are also tracing
the whereabouts of one woman.</i>

435
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:33,551
<i>She was seen by the missing man's father</i>

436
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:36,053
<i>and was driving a stolen vehicle
on that day.</i>

437
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:41,642
<i>Police are investigating a possible link
to the missing persons case.</i>

438
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:45,271
<i>This is Ma Jeong-pil on the scene
for YTN News.</i>

439
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,522
Want more wine?

440
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:49,942
Yeah, sure.

441
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,459
Are you crazy? Calling this number?

442
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:10,212
-You saw the news? What's going on?
-What?

443
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:13,757
"Not a simple disappearance"?
Why am I a suspect?

444
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,843
What did you tell the police?

445
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:27,479
Police saw signs of an accident,

446
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:30,691
but no one reported it,
so they're suspicious.

447
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,735
Who decided to report an auto theft?

448
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:38,449
The car is gone.
We had to come up with something.

449
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:40,534
Then you should've told me!

450
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:47,124
What's that?

451
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:51,045
His wallet. I removed it
after I put him in the trunk.

452
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:57,176
-What am I supposed to do with it?
-All you need is in there.

453
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:00,429
<i>His ID, business card, even credit cards.</i>

454
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,975
-You think it's possible?
-Make it possible.

455
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:08,437
<i>It's your specialty.</i>

456
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,147
The accident couldn't be helped.

457
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,651
But this is a crime!

458
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:15,444
You hid the body.

459
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,948
-Isn't that a crime?
-What?

460
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:23,786
You think you're safe
because his father didn't see you,

461
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:26,413
but I won't go down alone.

462
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,459
Never.

00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,970
<i>and carried out a search at his residence.</i>

479
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:09,850
<i>When the police began investigating Han,
we were no longer under suspicion.</i>

480
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:12,561
<i>We successfully closed the deal,</i>

481
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:15,230
<i>and I was named
Tech Businessman of the Year.</i>

482
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:18,609
<i>I was showered with congratulations
and interview requests.</i>

483
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:22,279
<i>But it was all a show.</i>

484
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:24,907
I felt sick on the inside.

485
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:33,415
Hello?

486
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:36,502
-<i>Is Ms. Yang there?</i>
-She's with me now.

487
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:38,754
<i>Did she sign the defense agreement?</i>

488
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:40,005
No, not yet.

489
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,010
Tell her everything and leave it to her.

490
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:48,013
She's never lost a trial case.

491
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:51,683
Whatever it takes,
make sure she signs the agreement.

492
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:52,935
<i>All right.</i>

493
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:59,399
And I think I found the truck.

494
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,735
Really? And the driver?

495
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:04,112
The truck was there,
but his house was empty.

496
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:08,742
-The prosecution sure is fast.
-<i>What do you mean?</i>

497
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:11,495
The prosecution's witness
may be that truck driver.

498
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:12,704
<i>Witness?</i>

499
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:15,415
<i>The evidence they have is a witness?</i>

500
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,000
That's what Ms. Yang heard.

501
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:20,379
Let me speak to her.

502
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:22,172
Just a second.

503
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:25,926
It's Attorney Jang.

504
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:30,639
-Hello?
-<i>Ms. Yang, thanks for your help.</i>

505
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:32,140
Of course.

506
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:34,184
What's this about a witness?

507
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:38,689
I'm trying to find out the details.
I'm not sure who…

508
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:41,608
-Hello?
-Hello?

509
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:45,404
Hello?

510
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,784
We were cut off.

511
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:55,497
So now, all your cards are on the table.

512
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,209
Two incidents.

513
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:02,379
Two bodies.

514
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:10,012
The police only know about Se-hee's
murder, so you're the only suspect.

515
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:13,724
They need to know about Han Sun-jae
to see other possibilities.

516
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:16,602
The third person hidden in that room

517
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:19,688
is surely connected to Han Sun-jae.

518
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:24,234
You said you were blackmailed?

519
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:27,070
Sir.

520
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:29,990
-This came for you.
-Who sent it?

521
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:32,743
There's nothing about the sender.

522
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:49,509
<i>The price of my silence
is one billion won in cash.</i>

523
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:53,055
<i>If you bring anyone
or tell anyone about this,</i>

524
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:55,140
<i>I'll reveal your infidelity.</i>

525
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:04,274
Mr. Yoo. I can't listen anymore.

526
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:09,863
I understand why you'd want
to reveal this blackmail over infidelity.

527
00:49:09,946 --> 00:49:12,658
Because you want to keep
the Han Sun-jae incident secret.

528
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:15,827
Answer one of three questions,
and I'll believe it.

529
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:21,083
First, who called the cops
before the attack in the hotel?

530
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:22,167
This is the police.

531
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:25,879
<i>Second, why didn't the blackmailer
take the money?</i>

532
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:29,007
Third, how did he leave the locked room?

533
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,554
You can't answer me, can you?

534
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:39,726
So calling this blackmail
over your infidelity won't stick.

535
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:45,107
It's not just creativity you lack.
Your logic is a mess.

536
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:49,194
Then what's your logic?

537
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:54,741
You say both of you got the same threat?

538
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:57,869
Yes, but he only asked me for money.

539
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:01,415
The way I view this incident…

540
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:06,920
Something's not right. Let's go.

541
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,334
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

542
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:49,296
You think the kid's father killed her?

543
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:52,507
Han Young-seok
has the clearest motivation.

544
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:54,843
What's his motivation?

545
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:56,136
Revenge.

546
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:01,308
Look at this.

547
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:04,686
My son made a call
before I met that woman.

548
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,688
She carried the phone to my house.

549
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:09,566
That's not viable as evidence.

550
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:13,403
And that woman wasn't alone.
She had company.

551
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,822
You only saw her. What's your evidence?

552
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:19,659
I told you! She adjusted her seat.

553
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,912
<i>She hadn't been driving it.</i>

554
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:23,914
It's my sister's car.

555
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:25,874
The car isn't hers.

556
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:28,710
-It belongs to D&T Security.
-Detective.

557
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:33,131
I'm begging you.
Please investigate this, okay?

558
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,718
Han Sun-jae!

559
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:38,637
Sun-jae!

560
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:41,348
Hey, move quickly!

561
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:42,891
-Let's start.
-Yes, sir.

562
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:45,477
We have a warrant to search your home.

563
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:47,687
Wait--

564
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,981
-Start with his room!
-Yes, sir.

565
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:51,733
Wait, what's going on?

566
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:56,655
Your son may have been
involved in financial crimes.

567
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:58,323
My son?

568
00:51:58,406 --> 00:51:59,741
Honey!

569
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:08,834
Sun-jae!

570
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:11,753
<i>A parent who loses a child
is already a monster.</i>

571
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:16,174
<i>If a son is wrongly accused
and the father can't find the body,</i>

572
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:17,717
<i>there's nothing he won't do.</i>

573
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:22,097
<i>Han Young-seok abandoned
his faith in the police</i>

574
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:25,725
<i>and he prepared to bring you
to justice himself.</i>

575
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:28,562
The price of my silence
is one billion won in cash.

576
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:31,523
If you bring anyone
or tell anyone about this,

577
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:33,859
<i>I'll reveal your infidelity.</i>

578
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:39,239
<i>He must've been confident
that he'd never be considered a suspect.</i>

579
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:45,579
Because he knew you'd never talk
about his son's case.

580
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:49,416
That weakness was what he targeted.

581
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,381
<i>And he succeeded.</i>

582
00:52:57,424 --> 00:53:02,512
<i>He made everyone think that you,
her illicit lover, killed Se-hee.</i>

583
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:07,309
<i>During the three days of your questioning,</i>

584
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:09,853
<i>he kept your lawyer on his watch.</i>

585
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:15,025
<i>And he checked all the ways
you might try to free yourself.</i>

586
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:21,865
-Mr. Yoo, give us a comment!
-Mr. Yoo!

587
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:25,118
<i>When your arrest warrant was nullified,</i>

588
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:28,455
<i>he even came to see me.</i>

589
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:32,250
MISSING PERSON

590
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:42,510
So you already knew
what happened two months ago.

591
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:44,763
Now that you know, let's not waste time.

592
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:49,935
But this all comes to naught, if we can't
figure out how he got in or out

593
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:52,395
of that room, right?

594
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:57,484
Han Young-seok knows all about you,
but you know nothing.

595
00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:01,947
That's why you can't see
the key to that locked room.

596
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,533
These are the crime photos.

597
00:54:13,249 --> 00:54:16,962
The key is outside the room, not in it.

598
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,968
Do you recognize this person?

599
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,975
-No.
-Of course not.

600
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:36,356
You've never met Han Sun-jae's mother.

601
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:41,152
She's even started working again.

602
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:45,573
Your guest has already
gone up to the room.

603
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:47,534
Would you like a second key?

604
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:52,622
<i>Name: Lee Hee-jung.</i>

605
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:55,125
She worked at the hotel's front desk.

606
00:54:56,710 --> 00:55:00,171
Now you understand?
Why they called you to that hotel?

607
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:05,635
<i>Han Young-seok knew you'd both
recognize the accident scene.</i>

608
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:10,598
The fact you came to the hotel
was half a confession.

609
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:14,477
<i>The rest went according to plan.</i>

610
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:29,951
<i>Booking the room next
to the storage closet was intentional.</i>

611
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:43,173
SHE'S GONE UP

612
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:49,220
<i>Han Young-seok waited
for you two in the closet.</i>

613
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:02,025
<i>Lee Hee-jung called the police.</i>

614
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:32,472
<i>And Han staged the crime
as the police were arriving.</i>

615
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:35,225
We received a call.

616
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:46,069
Excuse me.

617
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,098
Is everything okay?

618
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:17,725
I heard a strange noise inside.

619
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:40,039
<i>And he escaped the room
with his wife's help.</i>

620
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:03,646
Help!

621
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:06,733
Hands up!

622
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,486
Don't move!

623
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:10,695
It wasn't me.

624
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:13,364
-Don't move! Stay still!
-Someone else is here!

625
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,117
Someone else is here!

626
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:24,959
If you want to prove
you didn't kill Se-hee,

627
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:28,421
you need to implicate Han Young-seok.

628
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:31,382
So you have to bring up
the Han Sun-jae case.

629
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:39,307
The most incriminating thing
is the bank hacking.

630
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:42,477
It'll be impossible to prove it was me.

631
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,770
Good.

632
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,814
That day, you weren't
in the car with Se-hee.

633
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:49,025
You were in Busan as per your alibi.

634
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:52,237
Se-hee, who often drove your car,

635
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:55,406
had the accident
and covered it up herself.

636
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:58,201
Then she stopped calling.

637
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:04,082
So I become Se-hee's victim…

638
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:07,669
You hadn't seen her for two months
until that day at the hotel,

639
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:11,089
and you learned about Han Sun-jae
for the first time then.

640
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:18,012
If you had an accident in my car,
you should've told me!

641
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:22,433
Why didn't you say something?
What do I do now?

642
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:32,235
Can we do that?

643
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:34,404
The dead tell no tales.

644
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:39,158
We need one more puzzle piece
to prove she acted alone.

645
00:59:40,868 --> 00:59:43,955
Where is Han Sun-jae's car?

646
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,961
Still, the truck driver saw me.

647
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:54,591
Testimony can't compete with evidence.
We can refute his credibility.

648
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:58,845
-The prosecution will prove it in court.
-We make sure this doesn't go to court.

649
01:00:02,473 --> 01:00:03,600
How?

650
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:09,022
We just need direct evidence
that Se-hee killed Han Sun-jae.

651
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:14,527
Then if Se-hee, the only suspect, is dead,
the prosecution can't indict anyone.

652
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:19,032
Then no one can be indicted
for the Han Sun-jae case.

653
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:23,620
They just need to find
something of hers, or DNA.

654
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:27,915
But to plant it, we need the car.

655
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:34,047
Isn't there another method?
To prove Se-hee did it herself.

656
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:37,508
You come up with one.

657
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:45,725
This is when I start doubting.

658
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:52,065
When my client keeps trying to deceive me.

659
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:55,193
-How am I deceiving you?
-Are you not?

660
01:00:55,276 --> 01:00:56,611
No.

661
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:06,204
You seemed to really like
the scenario I created,

662
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:11,042
but however well you defend a lie,
it'll fall apart in court.

663
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:15,004
-Isn't it the truth?
-Only you know that.

664
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:20,677
What if everything was reversed?

665
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:22,345
Reversed?

666
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:29,018
Removing Sun-jae's wallet…

667
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:34,399
<i>and hacking the bank was all your idea.</i>

668
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:40,196
And if it was she who wanted to break up?

669
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:43,241
Sorry.

670
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:45,493
<i>The person driving…</i>

671
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:50,206
wasn't Se-hee, it was you.

672
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:57,630
Shall we go back to the start?

673
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:05,680
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Sorry, what did you say?

674
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:07,557
<i>When will you leave?</i>

675
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:09,934
As soon as I finish up here.

676
01:02:10,017 --> 01:02:12,562
-<i>Hurry, I miss you.</i>
-Me too.

677
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:36,627
<i>If you took the lead in all this,
wouldn't it make more sense?</i>

678
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:39,797
-What are you doing?
-We have to report it.

679
01:02:40,965 --> 01:02:43,760
Nobody saw it. We can just keep driving.

680
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:47,638
If you call the cops, we're both finished!

681
01:02:48,222 --> 01:02:49,557
Get a grip!

682
01:02:50,057 --> 01:02:53,186
<i>What if this whole situation
was driven by you</i>

683
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:57,774
<i>and Se-hee was the one
who tried to stop it?</i>

684
01:02:58,566 --> 01:02:59,567
MEDICAL REPORT

685
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,611
These are Se-hee's psychiatric records.

686
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:05,656
After the accident,
she suffered from severe anxiety.

687
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:09,660
<i>She couldn't take it anymore.</i>

688
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:12,205
POLICE SEARCH FOR MISSING
GANGWON MAN… TO NO AVAIL

689
01:03:15,082 --> 01:03:20,254
<i>Police say it may not be
a simple disappearance,</i>

690
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:23,049
<i>but they are waiting
for conclusive evidence.</i>

691
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:26,469
<i>Police are also tracing
the whereabouts of one woman.</i>

692
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:29,055
<i>She was seen by the missing man's father</i>

693
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:31,599
<i>and was driving a stolen vehicle
on that day.</i>

694
01:03:31,682 --> 01:03:36,979
<i>Police are investigating a possible link
to the missing persons case.</i>

695
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:42,527
Let's meet now and talk.

696
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:45,238
I'll go to you.

697
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,950
Are you crazy? I told you not to call me.

698
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:50,993
Why am I a suspect?

699
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:53,871
What did you tell the police?

700
01:03:58,709 --> 01:04:00,670
Hello.

701
01:04:02,296 --> 01:04:03,548
Hello.

702
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:06,425
This is my son.

703
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:15,601
<i>Finally, she made up her mind.</i>

704
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:21,399
<i>If she can't bring back their son,
at least she can do the right thing.</i>

705
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:25,736
Hello?

706
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:30,575
<i>Se-hee called Han Young-seok.</i>

707
01:04:30,658 --> 01:04:32,201
It was an accident.

708
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,370
Honey.

709
01:04:35,746 --> 01:04:39,375
<i>Promising she would find
the location of the son's body,</i>

710
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:42,670
<i>she begged for forgiveness.</i>

711
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:45,673
<i>I'll tell you where your son is.</i>

712
01:04:46,924 --> 01:04:48,551
I'm sorry.

713
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:08,404
Then, why didn't he report it
after his call with Se-hee?

714
01:05:08,487 --> 01:05:11,240
Proving a murder without a body
is nearly impossible.

715
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:13,534
Han must have known

716
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:16,495
that you'd never reveal where the body is,

717
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:20,625
that you'd always find a way out.

718
01:05:22,126 --> 01:05:27,131
He just hoped Se-hee
might figure out the body's location.

719
01:05:27,214 --> 01:05:28,716
But, Ms. Yang,

720
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:32,845
actually, I wasn't passed out completely.

721
01:05:33,804 --> 01:05:37,391
<i>I saw him for sure from that room.</i>

722
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:39,644
Why didn't you say so before?

723
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:43,898
I needed to know if I could leave my fate
in the hands of an attorney I'd never met.

724
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:46,943
I needed to figure you out too.

725
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:50,071
At least you're consistent.

726
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:54,784
It's my job to make you innocent,
but I can't do it if you lie.

727
01:05:54,867 --> 01:05:56,285
What lie?

728
01:05:58,496 --> 01:06:00,373
This photo proves it.

729
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:05,044
This woman and her husband
plotted to get revenge on me.

730
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:06,921
What stronger evidence is there?

731
01:06:07,004 --> 01:06:09,423
That woman is not Han Sun-jae's mother.

732
01:06:12,259 --> 01:06:14,220
She's just a hotel employee.

733
01:06:15,262 --> 01:06:17,139
I don't know her either.

734
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:20,977
There was never
a third person in that room.

735
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:23,896
It was just you and Se-hee.

736
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:27,400
At one mention of Han Sun-jae's mother,

737
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:30,152
you lie about seeing the father?

738
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:31,696
If you knew everything…

739
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:35,241
why invent such a story?

740
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:38,327
I need to hear the truth from your mouth.

741
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:43,708
I told you… not to contact me.

742
01:06:44,917 --> 01:06:47,962
So why would you do this
to get me out here?

743
01:06:48,045 --> 01:06:50,381
Otherwise you'd never take my calls.

744
01:06:50,464 --> 01:06:53,050
So what is it? What do you want?

745
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:55,428
Let's confess.

746
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,306
It's not as if we killed him.

747
01:07:12,069 --> 01:07:13,279
Kim Se-hee…

748
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:17,366
you've really gone mad.

749
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:22,621
I called his parents.

750
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:26,042
I told them everything.

751
01:07:26,959 --> 01:07:29,462
Tell them where the car is
and ask for forgiveness.

752
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:44,602
<i>It wasn't Han Young-seok
who killed Se-hee.</i>

753
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:47,271
I don't care what you do to me.

754
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:51,692
My mind's made up.

755
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:56,072
<i>You killed Se-hee,</i>

756
01:07:57,114 --> 01:07:59,366
and trapped yourself in that locked room.

757
01:08:01,869 --> 01:08:05,331
<i>You must've gone over it
several times in your mind.</i>

758
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:12,755
Excuse me, sir. Are you in there?

759
01:08:16,842 --> 01:08:20,387
This is the police. Open the door!

760
01:08:21,305 --> 01:08:22,640
I won't let you.

761
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:27,311
Mr. Yoo.

762
01:08:29,814 --> 01:08:31,816
There's no salvation without suffering.

763
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:36,821
And you're not as smart as I am.

764
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:40,658
Admit it, and tell the truth.

765
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:43,452
Then everything will be easier.

766
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,665
I will help you.

767
01:08:56,924 --> 01:08:59,718
Did you kill Kim Se-hee?

768
01:09:32,793 --> 01:09:33,878
Yes.

769
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:38,465
I killed her.

770
01:09:58,819 --> 01:09:59,945
Very well.

771
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:02,740
We'll take a break, then continue.

772
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:27,640
It will all be over soon.

773
01:10:28,974 --> 01:10:30,601
We're almost there.

774
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:40,361
Then what about his real mother?

775
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,696
One thing's for sure.

776
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:48,452
She must've felt
like a dead woman walking.

777
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,473
You're back late.

778
01:11:10,182 --> 01:11:13,394
But I can't reach Sun-jae.

779
01:11:14,478 --> 01:11:17,398
-Really?
-Yeah. He forgot his phone at home.

780
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:21,193
I'm sure he's out having fun.

781
01:11:23,737 --> 01:11:24,989
I'm cold.

782
01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:28,701
We have a warrant to search your home.

783
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:30,411
What's going on?

784
01:11:30,494 --> 01:11:35,499
Your son may have been
involved in financial crimes.

785
01:11:54,184 --> 01:11:55,561
Honey!

786
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:06,613
<i>I know about your son's disappearance.</i>

787
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:09,325
<i>It was an accident.</i>

788
01:12:11,035 --> 01:12:14,747
I'll find out where he is.

789
01:12:19,793 --> 01:12:21,170
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

790
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:27,426
<i>I'm truly sorry.</i>

791
01:12:31,221 --> 01:12:32,348
{\an8}<i>Breaking news.</i>

792
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:36,268
{\an8}<i>The head of an IT corporation
has been arrested on charges of murder.</i>

793
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:39,813
<i>Police have requested an autopsy
on the slain woman's body,</i>

794
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:43,400
<i>while the suspect, Mr. Yoo,
vehemently denies the charges.</i>

795
01:13:11,512 --> 01:13:12,596
Who are you?

796
01:13:15,682 --> 01:13:17,184
I'll see you tonight.

797
01:13:20,437 --> 01:13:21,647
<i>Mom!</i>

798
01:13:33,033 --> 01:13:36,495
<i>However hard I try, I can't remember it.</i>

799
01:13:38,163 --> 01:13:40,874
What my son said to me that morning…

800
01:13:46,797 --> 01:13:48,799
That was the last time.

801
01:13:51,176 --> 01:13:55,139
I'd been able to sense my son
every day when I woke up.

802
01:13:56,557 --> 01:14:00,018
Whether he was home or out…

803
01:14:02,312 --> 01:14:04,148
Every single day.

804
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:10,487
But I don't feel anything anymore.

805
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:14,158
What do you want?

806
01:14:14,241 --> 01:14:16,660
I know that it was an accident.

807
01:14:17,828 --> 01:14:22,374
Whether coincidence or a mistake,
I won't demand anything.

808
01:14:26,253 --> 01:14:29,256
But please… find my son.

809
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:31,717
These people

810
01:14:33,093 --> 01:14:36,180
are not people you can stand up to.

811
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:08,337
I MUST MEET THE CLIENT RIGHT AWAY
GOT NEW EVIDENCE

812
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:18,889
-Hello?
-<i>Are you ready?</i>

813
01:15:19,556 --> 01:15:22,309
Yes, I'll leave right away.

814
01:15:29,149 --> 01:15:33,070
ADD NEW CONTACT
MANAGER HAN SEUNG-YOON

815
01:15:49,586 --> 01:15:51,421
<i>I guess Attorney Jang is busy.</i>

816
01:15:52,005 --> 01:15:54,550
<i>He'll be here as soon as he can. This way.</i>

817
01:15:54,633 --> 01:15:57,177
<i>You must be tired
from the all-night interrogation.</i>

818
01:15:57,261 --> 01:15:58,804
<i>This is a long way away.</i>

819
01:15:59,429 --> 01:16:01,557
<i>I had to escape the press.</i>

820
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:06,687
You haven't escaped prosecution, though.

821
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:09,565
Policemen are stationed
five minutes from here.

822
01:16:09,648 --> 01:16:11,316
<i>Coffee okay?</i>

823
01:16:14,945 --> 01:16:17,656
-<i>Did she sign the defense agreement?</i>
-No, not yet.

824
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,909
<i>-That's what Ms. Yang heard.
-Let me speak to her.</i>

825
01:16:21,535 --> 01:16:22,995
Hello?

826
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:25,163
<i>What's this about a witness?</i>

827
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:27,082
<i>I'm not sure who…</i>

828
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,084
Hello?

829
01:16:29,167 --> 01:16:31,545
<i>-Ms. Yang?
-Hello?</i>

830
01:16:31,628 --> 01:16:32,796
<i>Hello?</i>

831
01:16:36,633 --> 01:16:37,676
We were cut off.

832
01:16:54,818 --> 01:16:57,571
So where were we?

833
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:07,998
You said we needed material evidence
to prove that Se-hee killed the kid.

834
01:17:08,081 --> 01:17:09,166
Right.

835
01:17:11,209 --> 01:17:13,837
-I have one of Se-hee's bracelets.
-Good.

836
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:20,427
We'll plant the evidence,

837
01:17:21,428 --> 01:17:24,890
then tell the police the location
in an anonymous tip.

838
01:17:25,849 --> 01:17:28,977
Tell Attorney Jang
to reinforce the Busan alibi.

839
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:31,480
The fact you concealed
the knowledge of the crime

840
01:17:31,563 --> 01:17:33,565
will get you probation at most.

841
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:34,858
Ms. Yang.

842
01:17:35,776 --> 01:17:39,279
Doesn't probation mean guilty?

843
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:43,116
I want to be not guilty.

844
01:17:46,244 --> 01:17:48,080
We'll do our best.

845
01:17:49,247 --> 01:17:52,793
But first we need to plant the evidence.

846
01:17:53,919 --> 01:17:57,798
Where… is the car?

847
01:18:10,435 --> 01:18:11,895
Sunk in a lake.

848
01:18:29,663 --> 01:18:31,123
With the body?

849
01:18:31,915 --> 01:18:32,916
Yes.

850
01:18:47,347 --> 01:18:49,057
There are many lakes in that area.

851
01:18:51,017 --> 01:18:52,102
Which one is it?

852
01:18:52,602 --> 01:18:56,606
But what if that truck driver
has some kind of evidence?

853
01:18:57,899 --> 01:18:59,860
We'd be revealing
the location for nothing.

854
01:19:00,444 --> 01:19:02,028
The prosecution has no witness.

855
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:03,905
What?

856
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:06,867
Any witness would've come forward
two months ago.

857
01:19:08,243 --> 01:19:11,204
I made it up
to get your confession faster.

858
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:18,295
Then, when you said you rushed over here
because of the prosecution…

859
01:19:20,505 --> 01:19:21,590
that was a lie too?

860
01:19:21,673 --> 01:19:24,342
Because of that, we saved time

861
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:27,846
and discovered a way
to prove you innocent.

862
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:31,641
You agree to defend me, right?

863
01:19:39,316 --> 01:19:42,235
Now that you're officially my lawyer,

864
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:44,404
<i>you're bound by confidentiality, right?</i>

865
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:19,689
There's one thing I haven't told you.

866
01:20:57,435 --> 01:20:59,062
I thought he was dead.

867
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:03,024
Really.

868
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:10,156
Save me!

869
01:21:11,074 --> 01:21:14,244
What… are you saying?

870
01:21:14,786 --> 01:21:18,290
It was too late to turn back.

871
01:22:02,792 --> 01:22:06,296
When I came to my senses,
I couldn't find the wrench.

872
01:22:07,088 --> 01:22:10,425
I searched, but it must have
ended up back in the trunk.

873
01:22:11,009 --> 01:22:12,177
Please take care of it.

874
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:15,513
When you plant the evidence,
get rid of the wrench.

875
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:17,390
You said it was an accident.

876
01:22:17,474 --> 01:22:20,268
By then it was too late anyway.

877
01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:23,438
How could you…

878
01:22:24,022 --> 01:22:26,608
I know it's difficult, but please help me.

879
01:22:26,691 --> 01:22:28,193
You said he was alive?

880
01:22:30,236 --> 01:22:31,947
You could have saved him.

881
01:22:32,697 --> 01:22:35,075
Despite your excuses, you're a murderer.

882
01:22:35,158 --> 01:22:37,035
You said you wanted the truth.

883
01:22:37,869 --> 01:22:39,245
So you can defend me.

884
01:22:39,329 --> 01:22:41,665
You don't deserve one bit of help.

885
01:22:41,748 --> 01:22:44,292
-What?
-You killed two people.

886
01:22:44,376 --> 01:22:46,795
-If people find out, you're finished.
-Shut up!

887
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:57,222
Are you not my lawyer now?

888
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:01,851
Then do your damn job. Got it?

889
01:24:31,274 --> 01:24:33,526
I KNOW WHERE SUN-JAE…

890
01:24:34,778 --> 01:24:37,864
-Ms. Yang?
-Yes?

891
01:24:39,324 --> 01:24:41,201
I'm sorry for shouting.

892
01:24:43,995 --> 01:24:46,414
Our contract is still valid, right?

893
01:24:48,416 --> 01:24:49,542
Of course.

894
01:24:50,794 --> 01:24:55,381
I can't break confidentiality,
or it'll leave a black mark on my career.

895
01:25:00,345 --> 01:25:02,097
Let me formally request your help.

896
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:27,122
Which lake is it?

897
01:25:50,311 --> 01:25:51,437
Is that correct?

898
01:25:53,648 --> 01:25:56,359
-Yes.
-Very well.

899
01:25:57,068 --> 01:25:59,779
I'll make arrangements
to plant the evidence right away.

900
01:26:50,079 --> 01:26:51,414
YANG SHIN-AE, ATTORNEY

901
01:26:55,835 --> 01:26:59,422
YANG SHIN-AE, ATTORNEY

902
01:27:18,024 --> 01:27:19,317
Just a minute.

903
01:27:25,823 --> 01:27:28,284
Sorry, you scared me.

904
01:27:31,329 --> 01:27:34,332
You won't be able to drive like this.
I'll look for tire chains.

905
01:27:34,415 --> 01:27:35,959
Come wait inside.

906
01:28:08,199 --> 01:28:09,742
Where did I put them?

907
01:28:14,831 --> 01:28:18,209
-Can I ask you something?
-What is it?

908
01:28:21,087 --> 01:28:23,715
How did you get to know the chairman?

909
01:28:26,843 --> 01:28:28,928
Through a lawsuit, of course.

910
01:28:29,512 --> 01:28:31,222
Really?

911
01:28:33,516 --> 01:28:35,810
I heard you were from the same hometown.

912
01:28:36,769 --> 01:28:37,854
That too.

913
01:28:39,355 --> 01:28:41,733
I mean, we first met in court--

914
01:28:41,816 --> 01:28:44,652
Ah, there they are.

915
01:28:46,487 --> 01:28:48,156
Would you bring me that stool?

916
01:29:01,669 --> 01:29:02,962
Thank you.

917
01:29:13,598 --> 01:29:16,142
You lie, too.

918
01:29:21,689 --> 01:29:24,442
The chairman's hometown is in North Korea.

919
01:29:38,247 --> 01:29:40,750
Who are you?

920
01:29:47,548 --> 01:29:48,966
Lee Hee-jung.

921
01:29:51,677 --> 01:29:53,721
The mother of the man you killed.

922
01:29:56,182 --> 01:29:59,227
Well, that makes sense.

923
01:29:59,811 --> 01:30:01,479
That boy did nothing wrong.

924
01:30:03,523 --> 01:30:05,775
You went too far.

925
01:30:05,858 --> 01:30:07,443
So did you.

926
01:30:07,527 --> 01:30:10,863
Your theory about Se-hee shocked me.
Almost perfectly accurate.

927
01:30:11,781 --> 01:30:16,202
That's when I decided
I could put my fate in your hands.

928
01:30:17,036 --> 01:30:21,207
Then you should've practiced
the signature.

929
01:30:23,459 --> 01:30:24,585
So what is it?

930
01:30:26,546 --> 01:30:28,089
What do you want from me?

931
01:30:28,881 --> 01:30:30,383
You want an apology?

932
01:30:31,592 --> 01:30:34,720
No, just let me find my son.

933
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:37,515
That map?

934
01:30:37,598 --> 01:30:40,143
I almost told you for real, but…

935
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:45,356
You were acting so strangely.

936
01:30:48,776 --> 01:30:52,196
Right, both of us were unlucky.

937
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:54,615
It was an accident, as you said.

938
01:30:55,533 --> 01:30:57,034
I won't bother you anymore.

939
01:30:59,954 --> 01:31:01,622
You can't just leave.

940
01:31:03,332 --> 01:31:04,584
-Wait!
-Let go of me!

941
01:31:13,259 --> 01:31:15,595
Hello? This is Mount 23.

942
01:31:15,678 --> 01:31:18,806
Help, someone's trying to kill me.
Come quickly.

943
01:32:05,061 --> 01:32:07,021
You think you're smarter than I am?

944
01:32:08,814 --> 01:32:10,316
What's really important…

945
01:32:13,486 --> 01:32:14,779
is to survive.

946
01:33:02,368 --> 01:33:05,121
We have a shooting incident.
Please send an ambulance.

947
01:33:26,183 --> 01:33:28,936
<i>Hello? This is Mount 23.</i>

948
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:31,647
<i>Help, someone's trying to kill me.
Come quickly.</i>

949
01:33:32,648 --> 01:33:33,983
That's everything.

950
01:33:34,066 --> 01:33:36,736
We got the call,
and a nearby police car came.

951
01:33:36,819 --> 01:33:39,405
We arrested Lee Hee-jung
with the gun in her hands.

952
01:33:43,284 --> 01:33:45,911
-How is he?
-The wound isn't serious.

953
01:33:45,995 --> 01:33:49,498
The roads are bad, so we'll treat him
here first, then transport him.

954
01:33:49,582 --> 01:33:52,585
I don't ever want to see
those people again.

955
01:33:52,668 --> 01:33:53,919
Don't worry.

956
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:58,049
Attempted murder is a felony.
Even for a first offense, it's serious.

957
01:34:02,219 --> 01:34:04,430
What about the recording from their car?

958
01:34:04,513 --> 01:34:07,058
Whatever you said, illegal wiretapping

959
01:34:07,141 --> 01:34:09,810
can't be used as evidence in court.

960
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:12,813
On the contrary,
that recording shows you're a victim.

961
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:26,952
The police will visit you in the hospital.

962
01:34:27,620 --> 01:34:30,331
But don't worry. I'll take care of it all.

963
01:34:44,887 --> 01:34:46,013
Just a minute!

964
01:35:03,656 --> 01:35:05,241
<i>Good news!</i>

965
01:35:05,324 --> 01:35:06,659
What is it?

966
01:35:06,742 --> 01:35:09,995
<i>That truck driver passed away a month ago.</i>

967
01:35:12,039 --> 01:35:15,668
Is it crude, calling that good news?

968
01:35:17,169 --> 01:35:20,214
They said the prosecution has no witness.

969
01:35:20,297 --> 01:35:21,549
Really?

970
01:35:26,220 --> 01:35:27,763
<i>How is Attorney Yang?</i>

971
01:35:28,264 --> 01:35:29,640
She's the best.

972
01:35:31,225 --> 01:35:32,685
Couldn't be better.

973
01:35:33,436 --> 01:35:36,981
<i>That's what we want. "Couldn't be better."</i>

974
01:35:37,565 --> 01:35:39,024
Thanks for your help.

975
01:35:57,376 --> 01:36:02,423
<i>The patient's condition seems good.</i>

976
01:36:13,726 --> 01:36:17,897
You've only made things more complicated.
Can you handle it?

977
01:36:18,647 --> 01:36:22,401
You came too far. You should've stopped
before it was too late.

978
01:36:29,241 --> 01:36:30,534
Yoo Min-ho…

979
01:36:33,913 --> 01:36:35,331
don't defend him.

980
01:36:37,958 --> 01:36:40,461
I say this as my apology to you.

981
01:36:47,384 --> 01:36:50,721
You will absolutely lose.

982
01:36:58,229 --> 01:37:00,648
Stop!

983
01:37:00,731 --> 01:37:02,608
Slowly, slowly!

984
01:37:02,691 --> 01:37:05,736
Come forward! Go ahead.

985
01:37:05,819 --> 01:37:08,822
-<i>Ambulance, stand by.</i>
-Roger.

986
01:37:18,415 --> 01:37:22,211
Yoo Min-ho… came here for a reason.

987
01:37:22,294 --> 01:37:25,214
<i>Attorney Yang says
she'll go directly to your cabin.</i>

988
01:37:25,297 --> 01:37:26,549
All right.

989
01:37:30,052 --> 01:37:32,137
400 M LEFT, ETA 6:50 P.M.

990
01:37:42,523 --> 01:37:45,025
You must be tired
from the all-night interrogation.

991
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:49,029
-This is a long way away.
-I had to escape the press.

992
01:37:53,075 --> 01:37:55,327
<i>He had something to do here.</i>

993
01:37:59,540 --> 01:38:03,085
When I came to my senses,
I couldn't find the wrench.

994
01:38:03,877 --> 01:38:05,212
What do you mean?

995
01:38:07,131 --> 01:38:08,591
My son Sun-jae…

996
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:16,599
I think I know where he is.

997
01:38:18,809 --> 01:38:21,270
<i>A place where no one
would stumble upon his body.</i>

998
01:38:22,187 --> 01:38:23,606
<i>A place only he knows.</i>

999
01:38:42,374 --> 01:38:44,209
<i>Sunk in a lake.</i>

1000
01:38:45,336 --> 01:38:47,254
This is private property.

1001
01:38:47,338 --> 01:38:49,131
It's also a crime scene.

1002
01:38:49,715 --> 01:38:51,842
Criminal Code, article 216, clause 1.

1003
01:38:51,925 --> 01:38:57,181
A crime scene can be searched
without a warrant.

1004
01:38:57,264 --> 01:38:59,475
<i>Diving team, access from behind the cabin.</i>

1005
01:38:59,558 --> 01:39:02,144
<i>Other search teams,
you can enter the property.</i>

1006
01:39:02,770 --> 01:39:04,104
Cabin team, go ahead.

1007
01:39:04,188 --> 01:39:06,106
Everybody, move!

1008
01:39:12,905 --> 01:39:16,283
INDUSTRIAL UNDERWATER SEARCH

1009
01:39:27,795 --> 01:39:29,338
YOO MIN-HO

1010
01:40:44,079 --> 01:40:45,581
Found it!

1011
01:41:28,457 --> 01:41:32,461
You are under immediate arrest
for the murder of Han Sun-jae.

1012
01:41:50,103 --> 01:41:51,522
<i>Mr. Yoo.</i>

1013
01:41:54,191 --> 01:41:56,193
<i>There is no salvation without suffering.</i>

1014
01:41:57,778 --> 01:42:01,031
<i>Admit it, and tell the truth.</i>

1015
01:42:02,908 --> 01:42:04,326
<i>I will help you.</i>

1016
01:45:06,299 --> 01:45:11,304
