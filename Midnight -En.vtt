I'm on my way.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.770
I'm not late for no reason.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.940
I'm so tired of working overtime.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.530
Don't talk like that.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.160
Hey!

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.500
I'm hanging up
if you keep talking nonsense.

I found it first!

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.350

Get in. Will take you
to the main road.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.240
No, thank you.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.000
Not many taxis at this hour.
Just get in.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.170
I don't get in a random guy's car.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.920
- Yes.
- I'm sorry.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.420
I didn't want to make you mad.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.680
The way you talked hurt me!

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.600
- Shall we get some chicken?
- Chicken?

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.190
It's your favorite.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.400
I'll be right there, get ready.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.110
Got it. Hurry!

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.650
- Okay.
- Okay.

Help me, please.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.510
Something wrong?

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.680
Hello?

Hello.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.830
Please help me.

Save me, please.

Please help me!

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.050
Sir.
You called 911, right?

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.090
Sir?

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.180
Over there...

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.430
- You go check.
- Yes, sir.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.940
Sir, are you okay?

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.360
You must've been shocked.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.110
Do you want some water?

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.070
No... I'm okay.

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.030
May I have a cigarette
if you've got one?

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.120
Yes, but what made you
so shocked?

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:13.460
Here.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.670
Sir!
There is a dead body!

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:19.920
What? Dead body?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.420
It's a female corpse.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.420
I've seen it all.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.470
You know those foreign workers...

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.440
Three of them
stabbed her mercilessly in turns.

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.610
I see, please wait here.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:40.570
Yes.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.740
- Get the line first, hurry.
- Yes.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.280
Don't go anywhere, sir.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:48.450
Damn, what the hell?

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.660
What did those crazy jerks do?

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.040
Hey, make it a bigger circle.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.960
Yes, sir.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.460
- Damn! Sir!
- What again?

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.380
There is a male corpse, too!

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.380
What the...?

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:20.980

How may I assist you?

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.200
- Yes, we will.
- Yes, sir.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.220
- Thank you for your order.
- Have a nice day.

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.050
(Of course.)

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:50.890
(Any further inquiries?)

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.890
(No, thank you.)

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.220

Hey, Choi Sojung!

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.680
Go change unless you want to die.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.640
Okay.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.140
But everyone's dressed like this!

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:21.140

- Yes.

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:23.810
Then go change

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:27.440
Please... Just once.

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:29.820
Told you I've got
a blind date today.

- OK, then.
- Yes?

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.460
Go change unless you want to die.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.290
Jeez! So gross!

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.920
- Watch your language!
- Do you ever wash your feet?

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.140

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.940

Here you go again.

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:21.580
Hey!

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:26.960
Don't drag mom and dad
into this!

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.380

- Stop!
- What now?

What is this?

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.230
Don't feel small to a boy.
You buy him a meal.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.310
So, by what time?

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.580
What a naughty one.

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:06.000
Attention, everyone!
Important announcement!

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:09.210
Who's in for tonight's drink
with clients?

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:10.790
(Mom, let's go to Jeju Island)

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.460
(Wy Jeju iland?)

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:22.720
(Well... to get some fresh air?)

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.530
(Here he goes.)

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:35.070
(Again?)

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:38.700
Why do we have to
liven up the mood?

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.990
- Right!
- It's not like...

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.830
Does it mean I'm a bar girl

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.410
and Mr. Nam's a gigolo?

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.540
But drinking with clients
is not our job!

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:50.290
She's right!
Why do you keep taking us?

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.000
If we lose our clients, who
are you going to consult with?

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:55.010
Who will pay your salary?

00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:00.260
You know the organization...
the company is...

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:04.970
What?

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.860
(Read it for me.)

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:24.870
'I'll go.'

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:26.580
'I'm also an employee,

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:27.910
so I can go.'

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:30.970
'A reasonable person like you

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:33.540
wouldn't discriminate me.'

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:42.850
Fine.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.980
- You understand her, right?
- Yes, ma'am.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.160
I have a nice body, you know.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.950
Hey, what do you think
her charm is?

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.040
In fact, she's my kind of girl.

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:13.750
I think it's her figure...

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:30.730
Isn't it a bit too much?

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:33.310
Shut up.
Don't spoil the mood.

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:35.400
She can't hear anyway.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.570
Pour me a drink.

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:44.370
(I'll grind your face.)

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.580
Oh, sucking up!

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:53.290
(Hey, you should wash
your eyeballs.)

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:55.330
Oh, bomb drinks!

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.500
(I said you look ugly!
Guess you don't get it.)

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:59.380
Wanna get trashed?

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:00.420
Great! Pour her some drink!

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:01.720
(Sir.)

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:05.160
(Shall I put you in the coffin)

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.140
(and close the lid?)

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.720
- She's swearing, right?
- (Let me just bury you!)

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:11.480
No way.

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:14.190
Never.

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:17.060
It's the K-heart.
She loves you.

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:18.900
She says, enjoy your meal.

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:25.570
My ladies are working hard.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.160
Here.

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:31.750
Great job this month, too!

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:33.290
For you.

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:37.000
I marked the numbers
on the envelopes,

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:39.130
check if they're correct.

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.670
- Don't lay on me later.
- Don't worry.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.060
You've done so much!

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:46.430
You doubled me!

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:48.350
(No, tripled!)

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.180
Where'd you spend it all on?

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:00.400
You're going to Jeju Island?

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.320
(My daughter asked me to go.)

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:05.470
She's going with her daughter.

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:06.860
I understand her, too.

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:09.410
Look at her smile.

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:11.330
Guess she's so happy.

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:18.880
Gosh.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:26.470
She doesn't bother to reply
after reading my texts.

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:28.180
What does she take me for?

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:31.640
Forget it. You said
she went on a blind date.

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:38.310
The two must be...
You know.

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:40.310
Know what?

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:42.690
Each other...

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:45.030
What do they do to each other?

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:46.320
Tell me, prick!

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.780
You really are a virgin.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.950
- Damn it.
- What do you think they would do?

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:57.250
Take care.

00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:58.810
(Don't come!)

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:00.520
(Don't! Stop there!)

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:03.440
(Stop!)

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:18.040
(Are you alright?)

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:20.460
(I'm fine.)

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:23.670
(Should've been careful!
No need to rush!)

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:25.040
(You should always watch out)

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:26.500
(What if you had an accident!)

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.840
(When are we going to Jeju?)

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.380
(Let's go soon.
I got paid.)

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:33.340
(What? No way.)

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:34.530
(I asked you to go)

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:35.720
(so I'll pay for the trip.)

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.850
(Can't hear you!)

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:41.890
(I'll pay no matter what!
I'm rich!)

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:50.690
(That's why you ran?)

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.450
(To show me this?)

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.530
(REDEVELOPMENT CONFIRMED
SOON TO TEAR-DOWN)

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:56.590

how the date went.

Sojung?

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:28.020
You little prick.

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:51.800
(I'll go park.)

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.510
(Wait there.)

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:58.640
(Anything you want to eat?)

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:01.390
(I'm full. I mean it.)

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:04.020
(Don't buy too much.)

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:18.930
I'm passing the supermarket.

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:21.220
Supermarket!
Are you deaf now?

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.350
Yes, I told you I'm almost home.

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:30.600

Report what?

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:33.690
You don't believe your sister?

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:36.400
- Damn it.
- What kind of brother are you?

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:41.280
Of course! He's not a man
if he doesn't like me.

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.160
Don't start!

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.180
I told you I'm almost home!

(Wy not coming?)

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:13.120

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:24.550

Please leave a
message after the beep.

Is she nuts or what?

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.940
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am.

Thank god it's not broken.

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:23.780
I'm so sorry to scare you.

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:25.450
Really sorry.

I'm sorry.

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:33.390
You're dead if you touch it.

Please... help me.

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:19.560

So annoying.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.340
I told you to go.

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.640

Excuse me.
Can I ask you something?

Hey, it's not working again!

Yes!

Oh, I see.

I was to meet my sister nearby

but suddenly I cannot reach her.

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:33.350
She is this tall...

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:35.840
wearing a yellow shirt

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.310
and white heels.

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.230

(Now, we don't have to worry.)

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:48.150
(I hope she's fine.)

00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:03.080
(Nothing but a bike and
the trash.)

(Are you sure about the location?)

(IT'S HERE.
SHE WAS HERE.)

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.500
No trace at all.

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:13.710

- CC...
- What?

CC...T

00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:29.690
See? I told you!

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:31.520
How about other angles?

00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:33.510
Kids turn the cameras

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:35.150
whenever they smoke!

00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:38.320
Please take a second look
just in case.

00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:42.330
Just check her
blood alcohol level.

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:46.540
It's yours, right?

00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:48.040
What is this?

00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:50.130
Ask her.

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:52.960
She threw this away
on the ground.

00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:55.130
Is it yours?

00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:03.100
I w...as ru...nnin'...

00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:05.560
I cannot understand.

00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:08.350
Ru...nnin...

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:09.960
I'll join you soon.

00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:11.230
Please wait down there.

00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:13.480
Take your time.

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:27.580
(I'm going crazy.)

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:29.460
(I'm not lying.
You believe me, don't you?)

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:39.570
(Have you noticed)

00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:44.600
(this man keeps glancing at us?)

00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:01.030
(It's because he doesn't
understand us.)

00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:04.030
(You know his sister is involved.)

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:09.330
(He was devastated moments ago,)

00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:12.290
(but he's so calm now.)

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:18.380
She is not my sister.

00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:35.110
N-O-T M-Y S-I-S-T-E-R.

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:55.650
Just got her message.

00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:56.960
Must've missed each other.

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:01.630
(He found her.)

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:07.510
Yes, I'm relieved now.

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:21.900
Yellow blouse, denim shorts.

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:25.740
White heels.

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:31.080
Then where is she now?

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:35.710
You don't know?

00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:42.300
And the man was wearing
a cap and a mask?

00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:45.430
Then you didn't see his face?

00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:47.970
Gosh.

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:51.810
Anything else you remember?

00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:54.640
How tall or...
how big he was...

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:57.020
I can answer that.

00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:00.270
He was about 170cm tall
and very slender...

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:03.560
Sir, I'll get your statement
later.

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:04.820
Please wait.

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:08.490
You're not supposed to
interrupt other's statement.

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:10.450
Yes, I'm sorry.

00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:13.660
Hey!

00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:18.710
Who do you think you are,
interrupting like that?

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:22.210
Mr. Cop will take care of
everything.

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:28.180
- Ruthless prick.
- Sir.

00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:29.840
Don't pick a fight.
Stay still!

00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:31.810
You think you're so smart?

00:39:31.890 --> 00:39:32.720
Sir.

00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:36.520
I heard you, so stop.

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:40.610
How dare you stare like that
when the elderly talks?

00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:41.980
Please, sir.

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:44.650
Did your parents raise you
this way?

00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:46.780
- Sir!
- Jerk.

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:48.360
Just go home
if you sobered up.

00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:49.990
I feel sorry for your parents...

00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:52.580
We won't let you in
if you behave like this.

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:00.170
Behave, moron.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:08.470
I've got no parents, you scumbag.

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:16.220
What did you just say?

00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:17.730
- Pardon?
- You called me a scumbag?

00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:19.020
Please!

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:20.730
Say it again!

00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:22.520
Please check if
everything's correct.

00:40:22.610 --> 00:40:24.820
Don't pick a fight
on a random person!

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:26.320
- You called me a scumbag?
- Please!

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.700
- He cursed at me.
- What did I say?

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:30.450
He called me a scumbag!

00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:32.410
- I didn't call you that.
- You did!

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:34.290
Say it again!

00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:36.830
- Say it again!
- Cut it out.

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:38.120
Give it to me.
That's mine.

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:39.580
- That little jerk has no respect.
- Please stop.

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:41.000
Get off me!

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:43.840
- Please, sir!
- You come here!

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:45.630
- So sorry.
- Just go home!

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:48.590
You're dead!

00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:14.030
May I take a look?

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:18.080
At that.

(ADDRESS: #13, SANGWOL-RO 102,
NAMYOUNG-GU, SEOUL)

00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:36.850
(It's really weird.)

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:39.100
(What?)

00:41:39.850 --> 00:41:44.810
(He had a black mobile earlier.)

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:48.280
(And?)

00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:53.280
(His mobile I just saw is white.)

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:54.820
(White?)

00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:59.470
(And the wallpaper)

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:04.000
(was a girl's photo.)

00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:10.970
Damn, you saw too much.

00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:16.720
What have you two been
talking about?

00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:26.480
(NOTHING.)

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:28.860
So what is that nothing?

00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:32.030
(What is it?)

00:42:33.490 --> 00:42:34.610
(Stop it, mom.)

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:36.740
(He seems offended.)

00:42:43.330 --> 00:42:45.750
Tell me what you two are
talking about!

00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:03.060
Tell me! What did you say?

00:43:08.610 --> 00:43:11.780
Damn, I sure did put it here.
Where is it?

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:31.360
We were on the phone

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:32.670
but now I can't reach her.

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:34.800
She's gone missing, I tell you!

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:37.970
You can't call it missing
for a couple missed calls.

00:43:38.050 --> 00:43:40.260
It's not a couple,
I called a hundred times!

00:43:40.350 --> 00:43:41.430
Okay, I hear you.

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:45.480
Are you done checking?

00:43:47.850 --> 00:43:50.610
Think about it, officer.

00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:53.690
She said

00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:56.650
she was in the neighborhood,

00:43:57.110 --> 00:43:59.570
then suddenly she's out of touch.
Do you think it makes sense?

00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:02.240
The neighborhood?
When was that?

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:04.620
About 10PM.

00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:06.620
10PM?

00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:11.000
- What was she wearing?
- A yellow blouse and...

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:13.880
for her blind date...

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:15.420
she wore white heels.

00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:16.590
White heels?

00:44:17.550 --> 00:44:18.540
You've got her picture?

00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:20.140
Yes, hold on.

00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:21.850
Here...

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:24.260
Show it to the folks here.

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.740
What?

00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:27.120
We were working on the report

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:28.770
for a similar case,
so show it to them!

00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:30.520
I see, okay!

00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:35.230
Excuse me sir,
have you seen this girl?

00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:38.610
- No, I haven't.
- I see, thank you.

00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:42.740
Ma'am, have you seen this girl...

00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:47.750
Oh, it was you...

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:50.540
Sorry.

00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:54.210
Excuse me, miss.

00:44:54.590 --> 00:44:56.550
Have you seen this girl?

00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:02.300
You've seen my sister?
Talk to me!

00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:05.100
She can't hear, so read this.

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:07.520
- Is she the one?
- Yes.

00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:09.940
Yes? Does this mean yes?

00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:10.980
It's his sister...

00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:14.570
- You scumbag!
- Sir, please!

00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:20.150
- You prick...
- Stop, sir.

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:22.620
- Please go home, sir.
- I'm choking.

00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:36.920
Shut your mouth.

00:45:37.210 --> 00:45:38.840
Or your girl is dead.

00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:49.600
Where... where is this?

00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:56.570
She's gone?

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:00.650
Miss...

00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:05.780
Did you see the prick
who hurt my sister?

00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:09.660
Did you see his face?

00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:13.120
Mask.

00:46:13.330 --> 00:46:14.920
He wore a cap?

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.630
- Open it.
- So you didn't see?

00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:20.510
His face?

00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:22.840
You should've seen it.

00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:25.840
Right, what did he wear?

00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:28.930
Red? Are you sure?

00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:30.560
Anything else?

00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:40.570
What the hell?

00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:42.780
I was having so much fun.

00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:45.240
That's me, the scumbag
who stabbed your sister.

00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:46.320
What?

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:50.700
You messed up with
a wrong person.

00:47:09.850 --> 00:47:12.770
What does he take this place for?
An elderly lounge?

00:47:13.310 --> 00:47:15.890
- What is it?
- Why are they still here?

00:47:23.610 --> 00:47:26.570
Say it!
Where's my sister?

00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:30.410
Tell me right now, scumbag!

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.340
Don't kill me.

00:47:40.590 --> 00:47:43.340
- Please don't.
- What?

00:47:44.010 --> 00:47:45.630
My brother is...

00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:48.760
a really tough man.

00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:52.510
So please let me go.

00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:56.480
So, I said to your sister.

00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:58.940
?쏧f your brother meets me,

00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:01.770
I will kill him, too!??

00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:33.140
Tell me!

00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:36.560
Where is my sister?
Where is she?

00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:42.270
Don't get worked up.

00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:44.650
It will only make her die sooner.

00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:49.110
What is it?
I said you don't have to worry.

00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:50.950
Sir!

00:48:52.070 --> 00:48:53.740
Mister, put that knife down.

00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:55.330
Please help me!

00:48:55.410 --> 00:48:58.910
Help me, please.
I'm so scared.

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:01.040
Sir, you must not do this!

00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:02.630
This scumbag knows
where my sister is.

00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:04.250
He is a witness, witness!

00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:06.840
No, he is that scumbag!

00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:08.800
I understand you are
worried about your sister.

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:10.090
But you shouldn't do this.

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:12.970
No! He is that jerk!

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:14.890
Please help me!

00:49:16.310 --> 00:49:20.350
I can hardly breathe.

00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:22.350
You scumbag!

00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:36.200
Are you alright?

00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:39.540
What's all this about?

00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:40.830
What happened?

00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:44.630
Those ladies...
since they can't talk,

00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:49.050
he asked me where his sister is,
then suddenly lost his temper

00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:52.050
and took out that knife
and threatened me.

00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:54.430
That man is a real dangerous one.

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:57.060
No, no!

00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:01.520
My... my sister.

00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:09.650
My sister...

00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:17.370
I told you not to get worked up.

00:50:33.090 --> 00:50:34.010
Sir.

00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:36.430
Are you sure you're okay?

00:50:36.930 --> 00:50:38.060
Yes, I am.

00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:40.470
I just feel a little dizzy.

00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:46.860
What is going on?

00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:49.860
I don't know.

00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:54.250
Sorry about that.

00:50:54.330 --> 00:50:55.570
You were just being nice.

00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:58.030
He must be worried
about his sister.

00:50:58.870 --> 00:51:01.790
I understand.
Let's not make a big deal of it.

00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:05.120
Would it be alright, sir?
Thank you so much.

00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:09.800
It's okay, he is not hurt.
You can be assured.

00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:14.220
He's fine, really.
No need to worry.

00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:17.260
Sir!

00:51:19.890 --> 00:51:21.180
Please take care.

00:51:23.230 --> 00:51:24.310
Good night.

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:30.070
Yes, he's alright.

00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:44.750
I've just told you
we checked everything!

00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:47.750
Please, I ask you.
Alright.

00:51:57.220 --> 00:51:58.640
We are so sorry.

00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:00.760
Only if you had told us...

00:52:00.850 --> 00:52:02.340
I kept telling you

00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:04.180
that jerk is the one!

00:52:04.270 --> 00:52:06.690
Yes, you did but...

00:52:07.230 --> 00:52:09.250
how could we believe you

00:52:09.330 --> 00:52:11.190
when you're swaying a knife?

00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:13.530
Find my sister right now!

00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:17.150
We contacted all the ERs nearby

00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:19.780
- so please be patient...
- You kidding me?

Hello? Police?
It's downtown in Sangwol-dong.

01:22:30.590 --> 01:22:32.640
Stop! She's my sister.

01:22:36.100 --> 01:22:38.180
Hey, hey!

01:22:38.890 --> 01:22:41.190
Don't you see she's frightening
all these people?

What if she gets hurt?
What will you do?

01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:47.820
I'm just... it's because
people are scared.

Here!

We might get stand-down for this!

01:23:21.210 --> 01:23:23.020
We didn't do it for that.

01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:24.610
But you never know.

01:23:27.610 --> 01:23:30.280
She was hiding behind the bin.

01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:36.320
Thank you so much.
I owe you big!

01:23:36.410 --> 01:23:39.690
And she had this.

01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:41.460
We wrapped with paper.

01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:50.970
Let's go. Good luck, sir.

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:53.970
Thank you, really.

01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:55.720
Thank you.

01:24:00.270 --> 01:24:02.640
You crazy wench.

01:24:08.730 --> 01:24:11.030
Did you really believe
you can live coming here?

01:24:13.820 --> 01:24:14.910
Did you...

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:21.330
expect people here to help you?

01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:27.500
Why? Wanna say something?

01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:39.510
I don't want to die.

01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:46.590
I really

01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:50.110
don't want to die.

01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:55.360
I still want to do

01:24:55.450 --> 01:24:59.830
lots of things

01:25:01.870 --> 01:25:09.630
and to go many places
with my mom.

01:25:10.670 --> 01:25:13.260
I want to marry

01:25:13.630 --> 01:25:16.430
a good man

01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:22.260
and have two kids.

01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:27.480
If you kill me now,

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:37.530
I can't do any of these.

01:25:41.490 --> 01:25:45.580
I beg you.

01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:53.880
Please don't kill me.

01:25:55.460 --> 01:25:57.420
Please,

01:25:58.180 --> 01:26:02.930
for this once,

01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:08.140
listen to me.

01:26:09.310 --> 01:26:14.570
I don't want to die.

01:26:34.710 --> 01:26:37.110
As you talk to me so eloquently,

01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:38.800
I get more convinced.

01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:42.470
That I must've been in trouble

01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:46.310
if anyone paid attention to you.

01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:56.690
What are you looking at?

01:26:58.400 --> 01:26:59.820
What are you staring at?

01:27:02.910 --> 01:27:04.950
Do you think it would
change anything?

01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:08.040
You damn prick!

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.130
Are you alright?
Aren't you hurt?

01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:21.550
You scumbag.
I'm gonna kill you.

01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:43.030
A crazy dog like you deserves
to get beaten to death!

01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:44.740
Damn!

01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:16.110
Are you alright?

01:28:19.860 --> 01:28:20.940
I am sorry.

01:28:22.990 --> 01:28:24.910
You...r si...ster...

01:28:25.450 --> 01:28:26.280
Sister?

01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:30.790
My sister!
She went to the hospital.

01:28:31.330 --> 01:28:32.160
She's alright.

01:28:32.790 --> 01:28:36.000
And right... your mother!

01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:37.170
Mom? My mom?

01:28:37.250 --> 01:28:40.380
She came here, too.

01:28:40.670 --> 01:28:45.010
I tried to stop her
but she was too worried.

01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:50.510
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

01:28:52.430 --> 01:28:53.770
You scumbag!

01:28:56.190 --> 01:28:57.560
I told you I hate getting beaten!

01:28:59.980 --> 01:29:01.400
You prick!

01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:07.320
Only thing you deserve
is to be dead! Dead!

01:29:07.410 --> 01:29:08.910
Scumbag!

01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:14.080
Do you even know
how to use it?

01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:36.890
Step back.

01:29:44.190 --> 01:29:46.320
I told you
I will kill at least one.

01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:48.360
What?

01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:52.790
So her mom is here?

01:29:54.750 --> 01:29:55.700
No.

01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:12.640
Miss.

01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:47.720
Mom!

01:30:59.810 --> 01:31:07.940
My da...ugh...ter...
wh...ere sh...e?

01:31:11.820 --> 01:31:14.240
Daughter?
Your daughter?

01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:17.120
I've searched for you
so desperately, mom.

01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:20.290
Your daughter,
she is there.

01:31:35.470 --> 01:31:37.220
Go, I said she's over there.

01:31:40.430 --> 01:31:41.350
Go!

01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:11.880
(Don't come.)

01:32:15.140 --> 01:32:16.970
(I'll finish this.)

01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:28.150
Do you think
you can stop me like this?

01:32:30.780 --> 01:32:33.360
I asked if you even know
how to use it.

01:32:35.740 --> 01:32:38.030
What can you do?
You just missed.

01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:40.200
You only hurt your hand.

01:32:54.220 --> 01:32:55.260
What did you do?

01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:00.310
What the heck are you doing?

01:33:15.900 --> 01:33:17.620
He stabbed her, right?

01:33:18.700 --> 01:33:20.200
No... that's not...
Not me...

01:33:21.290 --> 01:33:22.830
No, I didn't do it.

01:33:31.050 --> 01:33:33.920
Think about it.
Focus! Focus!

01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:37.800
Focus! Focus!

01:33:40.050 --> 01:33:43.140
She tried to stab me...

01:33:43.220 --> 01:33:45.600
but then suddenly she didn't.

01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:46.690
Damn it!

01:33:47.020 --> 01:33:48.350
Clear the parameters.

01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:50.270
You should've stabbed me.

01:33:50.350 --> 01:33:51.820
Why hurt yourself?

01:33:52.650 --> 01:33:53.980
Drop that knife, now!

01:33:54.610 --> 01:33:56.490
I'm so messed up.

01:33:58.910 --> 01:34:00.280
Sir, please put that down.

01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:06.160
Don't move! Freeze!

01:34:16.590 --> 01:34:17.760
You're smiling?

01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:22.720
Are you laughing at me?

01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:26.140
Don't you smile.

01:34:34.150 --> 01:34:35.610
Damn it...

01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:03.550
Scumbags

01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:07.060
like you

01:35:11.650 --> 01:35:16.570
deserves this...

01:35:22.780 --> 01:35:24.530
Go to hell!

01:35:54.980 --> 01:35:58.530
I'm... going...to...kill...you...

01:35:59.530 --> 01:36:00.360
Kill...

01:37:25.030 --> 01:37:27.070
(My girl, you look so pretty.)

01:37:27.820 --> 01:37:28.820
(I know.)

01:37:30.910 --> 01:37:32.240
(You like it here?)

01:37:32.830 --> 01:37:38.540
(Yes, I like it better
as I'm with you!)

01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:42.460
(Let's eat a lot of fancy food)

01:37:42.550 --> 01:37:45.170
(and take loads of pictures!)

01:37:45.260 --> 01:37:48.180
(Sure! I have a lot of money!)

01:37:48.430 --> 01:37:50.640
(Talk about money again?
You're helpless.)

01:38:04.070 --> 01:38:05.240
Sis!

01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:11.910
Hello, hello.
How are you?

01:38:12.950 --> 01:38:14.710
Sorry we are late.

01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:16.210
How have you been?

01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:24.300
Shall I do like this?
Right?

01:38:29.010 --> 01:38:30.840
Not like that!

01:38:31.220 --> 01:38:33.010
- You are so hopeless.
- It's too hard.

01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:36.400
Let's take a picture together

01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:37.720
and have good time!

01:38:40.270 --> 01:38:42.270
Yes, let's have fun!

01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:48.200
- Smile, Jongtak.
- Smile?

01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:03.880
(Jin Kijoo)

01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:07.880
(Wi Hajun)

01:39:07.970 --> 01:39:11.930
