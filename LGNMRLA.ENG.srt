-Watch the powder! -Yes, General!</b>

155
01:13:30,525 --> 01:13:35,626
<b>Strategist Wang!
Please take me with you.</b>

156
01:14:00,430 --> 01:14:05,782
<b>Distance is the key. The magnet is
only effective when close to the beast.</b>

157
01:14:06,102 --> 01:14:10,606
<b>Therefore, the effect weakens
as it gets further away.</b>

158
01:14:10,607 --> 01:14:13,247
<b>You see I have it
under complete control.</b>

159
01:14:16,821 --> 01:14:18,836
<b>Write down nine feet.</b>

160
01:16:06,514 --> 01:16:10,698
<b>Steer to the rear of the palace.
-Yes. To the rear of the palace!</b>

161
01:17:20,463 --> 01:17:22,895
<b>Light a grenade!
-Yes, sir!</b>

162
01:18:11,681 --> 01:18:13,696
<b>State your purpose!</b>

163
01:18:28,503 --> 01:18:31,477
<b>General Lin Mae of the Nameless Order.
At your service!</b>

164
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:43,850
<b>What took you so long?</b>

165
01:18:43,851 --> 01:18:46,603
<b>The Tao Tei have overrun the city!</b>

166
01:18:46,604 --> 01:18:49,337
<b>Thousands of soldiers and
innocents are dead. You're too late!</b>

167
01:18:49,338 --> 01:18:51,633
<b>Your Majesty, where is
the captured Tao Tei?</b>

168
01:18:51,634 --> 01:18:54,420
<b>In the dungeon!
-We need to kill the Queen.</b>

169
01:18:54,421 --> 01:18:57,971
<b>Once she is dead,
the Tao Tei cannot function.</b>

170
01:18:57,972 --> 01:19:01,113
<b>Without her signal, their
whole army will freeze.</b>
