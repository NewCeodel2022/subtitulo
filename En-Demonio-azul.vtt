Calm down!

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:31.220
Takeshi!

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.300
Takeshi!
Wait!

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:43.970
Shun.

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:52.240
Anna.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.220
Anna, why are you here?

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.460
I want to check something.

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:06.160
Besides that,
what happened just now?

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:08.890
Takeshi looked very strange.

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:13.120
We saw it, too.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.350
I don't know what it was.

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:18.950
Something we've never seen before.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:23.900
But...

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:27.800
...I felt I've seen it before.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.450
Where have you ever seen it?

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:37.040
I don't know.

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:39.760
Get out of here, Anna.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:40.670
I feel something bad.

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:42.780
But the door can't be opened, Shun.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.120
I've checked all the others.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.210
How can...?

00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:57.530
Let's go.

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.100
Better to call them all back here.

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.560
Shun, come on.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:14.780
Follow me.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.180
This place is hell!

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:21.830
Takuro! Takuro!

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:23.900
Where are you?

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:27.090
I don't want to stay here anymore!
Do not want to stay!

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:31.880
Tell me, what happened?
Damn!

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:43.690
The door...

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:46.320
...the door opened on its own.

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:02.810
Right here.

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:05.910
Okay.

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:08.480
Put the goods here.

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.790
I'm not feeling well.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.930
What's the matter now?

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:25.040
It is true. I feel bad.

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:28.880
I didn't want to come here, either.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:32.300
Then...

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:36.360
I know this place is creepy, but...

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:39.120
...what makes you feel uncomfortable?

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:41.380
Mika.

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:43.840
What do you think
is here?

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:49.580
Ghost.

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:55.800
There is a ghost?

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:00.230
Very funny.

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:03.020
How many years have I not even
mentioned that word.

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:07.050
Good for you.
Do not be stupid now.

00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:08.820
Let's get this done.

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:10.650
I'm going down.

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:12.250
You wait there.

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:34.700
Mika, what happened?

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.180
Something strange
is in this building.

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:40.840
It saw me.

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:42.180
Calm down now.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.750
Maybe there is someone here.

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.830
Don't!
We must leave immediately.

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:12.460
Do not go, Hiroshi.

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.250
Do not startle people, stupid!

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:04.900
Takeshi.

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:08.140
Hey, Takeshi!

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:11.480
Something is here with us.

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:13.130
I saw it.

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:15.760
Takuro saw it.

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:18.350
It's true.

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:20.530
-  Naoki got injured, also.
- Takeshi!

00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:22.840
If you talk about it anymore...

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:24.980
...Takuro will kill you.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:28.710
Takeshi.

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:31.010
There is no point hiding here.

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.400
Come out first.

00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:55.600
I'm thinking...

00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:59.070
...the rooms here are very strange, right?

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:02.660
Yes, strange.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.270
Hey! Takeshi!

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:14.140
I want to stay here.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.570
If we do not go home...

00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:17.850
...our parents will start to
worry and look for us.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.160
Therefore...

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.100
...they will certainly find us here.

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:22.680
So until then...

00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:24.180
...I'll wait here.

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:26.740
I do not want to wait here.

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:29.230
I want to get out of here
as quickly as possible.

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:31.330
The same with me!

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:34.300
Well, I understand.

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:37.320
We will pick you up
when we leave.

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:39.520
After we leave, we will
tell your family.

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:41.050
Takeshi, before then...

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:42.570
...you wait here.

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:44.230
Understand?

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:50.990
Takeshi.

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:54.630
Can you lend me that?

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:56.160
Take it.

00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:58.770
Thank you.

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:03.250
Bye... coward.

00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:05.320
What is it?

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:15.780
Anna!

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:18.270
How did you get here?

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:20.390
- There's something...
- You should speak clearly!

00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:23.330
Didn't you find anything strange?

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:25.970
That...

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:28.580
...entrance suddenly could not be opened.

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:30.300
The other one?

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.220
There is one person
who is very frightened.

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:43.510
Where is Takuro now?

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:45.740
I don't know.

00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:47.680
I lost him in the middle
of the journey.

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:50.660
Takuro might know something.

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:54.290
Takuro, you are actually...?

00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:06.240
Enough.

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:08.130
I want to go home.

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:10.820
Why do I have to be in a
horrible place like this?

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:14.640
Takuro, you're why
we're all here.

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:21.930
Hello...? Hello...?
Do you hear me?

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.380
In JAIL HOUSE.
Just behind the abandoned factory.

00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:29.530
Hello? Hello?

00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:33.890
Damn!

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:42.170
Hey!
Takeshi.

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:44.990
Takuro!

00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:48.470
What is it?
Are you okay?

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.900
Takuro, let's get out of here.
There is a monster!

00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:59.930
What's that noise?

00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:04.390
Let's see.

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:14.110
Help me!

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:19.820
Takeshi!

00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:26.110
Takeshi!

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:28.970
What's happening, Takeshi!?

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:29.900
Takeshi!

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:40.630
Takeshi.

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:51.210
He was eaten alive.

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:53.580
Takeshi.

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:58.360
I don't know what it is, but we
have to get out of here now.

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:02.660
Key to the entrance?

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.150
Takuro had to bring it, right?

00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:08.590
Where is Takuro, Mika?

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:11.830
I don't know.

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.930
We split-up back inside!

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:17.430
Mika!
We have no time left.

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:20.740
Just now Takeshi was brutally
murdered, you know?

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:23.320
What are you hiding?

00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:24.680
Actually, why was Takuro here?

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:25.620
Nosy!

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:28.840
You do not need to know.

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:34.890
What are you hiding?

00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:38.600
What do you mean?

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:41.810
That was what Takeshi said.

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:44.690
Does Naoki's accident mean anything?

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:48.330
"If you keep talking like this
Takuro will kill you."

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:50.060
That's what you said, right?

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:55.960
I don't know.

00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:58.200
What is Takuro doing here?

00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:59.780
I do not know anything.
It has nothing to do with me!

00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:00.570
Tell me about Naoki!

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:02.170
I told you I do not know!

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:03.260
Mika!

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:08.090
Shun, we also have to...

00:33:09.850 --> 00:33:10.620
Shun.

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.260
Shun!

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:16.260
Anna.

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:19.240
We have to get out of here!

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:22.430
Am I dreaming!?

00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:28.140
This feeling.
This atmosphere.

00:33:31.650 --> 00:33:32.930
I feel it, too.

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:38.190
Just like games which I
have made.

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:00.640
Who?

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:03.880
Takuro!

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:09.660
Mika, you have...

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:11.250
...not kept watch above?

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:12.380
Listen to me, Takuro!

00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:16.830
Takeshi is dead.

00:34:17.970 --> 00:34:19.130
He was killed.

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:22.020
What the hell is that?

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:25.450
Inside this place is a monster.

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.000
If we stay any longer we
will all die.

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:31.730
Ghost then?

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:34.960
Mika... you...

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:37.480
Too much use of drugs?

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:38.890
I'm serious!

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:42.410
I understand you keep
watch up top.

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:43.680
I will be done soon.

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:50.540
I'll see you shortly.
Wait a minute.

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:11.830
I do not want to wait, Takuro.

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.960
I cannot stand it anymore.

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:20.640
May we leave?

00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:24.080
May...

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:26.800
May... whatever.

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:30.900
May...

00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:36.710
Bye, Takuro.

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:42.600
Why? Can't wait?

00:35:57.330 --> 00:35:58.400
This place...

00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:02.070
Anna, was...

00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:06.250
Can you pull out a book with
me at the same time?

00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:08.470
This book.

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:11.060
I understand.

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:16.050
1... 2...

00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:22.080
This?

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:28.000
Key?

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:30.300
I think so.

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:31.990
As in the game?

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:36.300
Why?

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:40.780
Shun...

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:43.990
Anna.

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:45.280
Run!

00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:08.370
What is this?

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:17.870
Takuro?

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:01.890
Hiroshi?

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:20.430
Mika?

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:22.710
Mika?

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:24.450
Mika!

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:25.960
Mika!

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:29.780
Are you there?
Mika?

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:30.990
Mika!

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:34.380
Mika!

00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:19.310
Open.

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:13.720
Further to piano room.

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:42.750
Shun, open the door.

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:45.500
It's Mika.

00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:47.660
Shun!
Don't do it!

00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:50.560
That is not Mika!

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:56.720
Anna, Shun... help me.

00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:01.370
Anna, why?

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:05.290
Shun, Mika would not call you.

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:08.360
Please, believe me!

00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:11.040
She wouldn't call me?

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:28.850
Shun!

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:30.340
Shun!

00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:39.590
Shun, Mika would not call you.

00:42:43.090 --> 00:42:44.300
Help me!

00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:57.890
Blue demon!

00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:05.800
Anna!
Right here!

00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:28.500
Here...

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:44.810
Inside this is a handkerchief.

00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:53.900
Shun!

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:08.140
Quick!

00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:25.580
Hurry, Anna!

00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:57.900
Mika.

00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:06.490
Shun...

00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:08.200
Where to next?

00:45:10.070 --> 00:45:11.000
The piano room.

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:13.110
Clean piano with this handkerchief.

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:14.490
A secret code will appear.

00:45:15.130 --> 00:45:17.830
The code to unlock it from the
vault in the next room.

00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:19.010
We could find the key.

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:21.880
Then go to the tool room and
open the carpet.

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:23.200
There will be the entrance
to the basement.

00:45:32.170 --> 00:45:33.190
Earlier...

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:35.400
...how could...

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:38.010
...you know it wasn't Mika?

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:51.600
Shun...

00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:56.500
You look like Naoki.

00:46:01.310 --> 00:46:03.100
You've never heard about him.

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:05.290
About my brother...

00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:11.380
...Horikawa Naoki who
died 6 months ago.

00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:15.900
He was two years
younger than me.

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:17.490
We attended the same school.

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:20.290
As we got older...

00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:22.410
...we always fought.

00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:28.690
Naoki...

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:32.500
...was often bullied.

00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:38.700
I...

00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:41.000
...I knew it.

00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:43.700
I repeatedly asked Naoki...

00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:48.700
...to tell me what had happened.

00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:50.790
But...

00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:54.090
...he always said "It's okay".

00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:56.810
And smile.

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:04.110
He said "It's okay" with a smiling face.

00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:06.500
It was all a lie.

00:47:12.370 --> 00:47:15.100
You are very similar to Naoki.

00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:21.400
Such is Naoki.

00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:28.890
Did Naoki like it?

00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:35.200
The blue demon... earlier it also...

00:47:41.570 --> 00:47:43.100
What I've said...

00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:45.300
... do you believe me?

00:48:06.090 --> 00:48:07.850
Anna! Thank goodness.

00:48:07.850 --> 00:48:08.800
You okay?

00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:10.090
Hiroshi.

00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:23.210
Mika.

00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:30.600
Hiroshi, it's still possible to
get out of here.

00:48:32.490 --> 00:48:33.400
I understand.

00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:35.200
Let's go.

00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:13.390
Still not you?
Takuro...

00:49:15.350 --> 00:49:18.700
I cannot stand it anymore.

00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:21.000
Come on...

00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:23.200
Allow?

00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:26.800
Mika.

00:49:28.330 --> 00:49:31.200
I also cannot stand
it anymore.

00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:49.010
Anna... this...

00:49:49.010 --> 00:49:50.050
...this is the game.

00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:50.530
Game?

00:49:50.530 --> 00:49:52.420
Since this is a game.

00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:54.790
It's too unreasonable.

00:49:55.550 --> 00:49:56.500
Further...

00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:58.600
...to the tool room.

00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:00.190
Then open the carpet.

00:50:00.490 --> 00:50:02.500
And we will find the door
to the basement.

00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:03.790
Anna.

00:50:03.830 --> 00:50:05.940
Let's end this game.

00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:07.090
Come on.

00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:28.820
The door is already open.

00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:32.900
Let's go.

00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:06.900
Why do you come in here?

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:10.590
It does not matter.

00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:13.200
Why?

00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:15.690
Why did you come down here?

00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:18.400
If you do not run away with us...

00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:20.020
...you're going to die.

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:22.900
Die?

00:51:23.730 --> 00:51:24.520
Huh?

00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:27.200
What nonsense is that?

00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:32.900
Did you kill him?

00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:36.890
You...

00:51:39.870 --> 00:51:42.490
I do not know what you mean.

00:51:44.130 --> 00:51:45.100
Anna.

00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:48.000
Your brother.

00:51:48.490 --> 00:51:50.290
He committed suicide.

00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:53.490
I just bullied him a little.

00:51:57.550 --> 00:51:59.290
I'm going to stop this!

00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:01.000
Yeah right, Shun?

00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:03.090
Shun?

00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:07.200
Yes.

00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:10.500
This is a game created by Shun.

00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:12.190
Game?

00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:16.420
Do you like games like this?

00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:19.210
You do not mean it like...

00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:23.200
You... against Shun.

00:52:25.090 --> 00:52:25.890
Anna.

00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:29.790
From Shun Shun Shun had continued...

00:52:29.790 --> 00:52:32.000
Really very disturbing.

00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:33.690
Say...

00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:35.600
What do you mean?

00:52:38.170 --> 00:52:39.100
Turns out I was right.

00:52:41.490 --> 00:52:42.410
In there...

00:52:43.610 --> 00:52:44.800
...since when did you know?

00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:51.800
Shun.

00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:55.790
Stop the attitude.

00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:58.700
Horikawa Anna.

00:53:53.890 --> 00:53:55.600
What was that?

00:54:04.890 --> 00:54:05.790
Takeshi!

00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:14.010
Shun...

00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:18.400
Anna...

00:54:28.590 --> 00:54:31.800
Shun, Mika will not call you.

00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:34.400
Not call me?

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:35.100
Just now...

00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:40.390
How do you know it is not Mika?

00:54:50.850 --> 00:54:54.200
Am I dreaming?

00:54:55.690 --> 00:54:57.090
I'm not so sure.

00:54:58.650 --> 00:55:02.300
Do you believe what
I am saying?

00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:09.890
Seriously?

00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:47.900
You know too much.

00:55:49.490 --> 00:55:51.710
You can not leave here alive.

00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:53.000
Shun.

00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:55.600
It may be hard to believe...

00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:59.450
...that it is Takuro who caused
my brother and your death.

00:55:59.450 --> 00:56:00.690
He did it all!

00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:02.800
Shun.

00:56:03.490 --> 00:56:04.600
My name...

00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:08.890
...she uses in this game
without permission.

00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:12.400
Really pisses me off.

00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:18.710
Shun is...

00:56:19.010 --> 00:56:20.290
...here now.

00:56:22.730 --> 00:56:23.590
Then?

00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:25.700
Ghost then?

00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:31.790
No point. I do not have
time to play with you.

00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:36.160
When I came here he stayed
by my side to help me.

00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:37.100
Always.

00:56:38.410 --> 00:56:41.000
He thought he was still
alive just like us.

00:56:41.350 --> 00:56:43.010
That's it, Shun.

00:56:46.830 --> 00:56:48.190
But, forgive me.

00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:51.660
I already knew...

00:56:55.180 --> 00:56:56.690
...when I first came here...

00:56:57.300 --> 00:56:59.100
...Shun, has been...

00:57:12.590 --> 00:57:13.700
Shun...

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:16.900
Thinking back...

00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:20.910
...immediately hide the body...

00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:24.200
...and we could have
all gone home.

00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:27.090
I just...

00:57:29.530 --> 00:57:33.600
...I could just let it die happy.

00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:39.390
You're better off dead.

00:57:40.430 --> 00:57:42.600
Better that I die?

00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:49.590
The one who will die...

00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:52.990
...is you.

00:57:53.370 --> 00:57:55.500
No. You will die.

00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:11.990
Help me! Help me!

00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:23.100
Hiroshi!

00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:24.970
What?

00:58:24.970 --> 00:58:26.610
Hurry!

00:58:26.610 --> 00:58:28.410
Now, Hiroshi!

00:58:58.250 --> 00:58:59.290
Hiroshi!

00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:01.610
Anna.

00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:03.790
You go first.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.830
No! Quick, Hiroshi!

00:59:07.830 --> 00:59:09.180
Anna!

00:59:11.810 --> 00:59:13.100
Go.

00:59:15.090 --> 00:59:18.300
Get out alive.

00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:32.690
Run!

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.100
Shun.

01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:28.000
I do not know what to do.

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:55.900
I do not know.

01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:01.600
What do I do?

01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:03.690
I do not remember.

01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:06.410
Anna.

01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:08.900
Anna.

01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:18.760
Anna!

01:01:20.090 --> 01:01:22.110
It is our own choice.

01:01:22.110 --> 01:01:23.700
We can get out of it.

01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:27.700
Naoki always...

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:31.000
...smiled and said, "It's okay".

01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:36.910
He said "I'm okay"
with a smiling face.

01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:38.810
It was all a lie.

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:40.900
Anna!

01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:42.500
Clearly in pain.

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:54.500
It's okay.

01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:00.200
Why?

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:03.790
Why didn't you say something?

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.300
Anna.

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:33.590
Come on.

01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:50.740
Shun.

01:02:58.330 --> 01:02:59.100
Anna.

01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:00.610
What is it?

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:03.100
Are you okay?

01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:08.700
Sorry.

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:10.600
Very frightened then?

01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:14.600
No.

01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:17.600
I just...

01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:19.600
...think of too many things.

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:28.950
Courage to go forward?

01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:30.090
True.

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:32.800
Dynamic program.

01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:34.000
Yes.

01:03:48.650 --> 01:03:49.600
Shun.

01:03:52.530 --> 01:03:53.600
My brother...

01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:56.700
...I could not help him.

01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:05.900
You can tell me anything.

01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:13.900
Anything.

01:04:21.532 --> 01:04:22.772
Thank you.
