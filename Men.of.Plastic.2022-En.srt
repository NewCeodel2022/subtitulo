00:00:55,205 --> 00:00:56,290
Good morning, Mr. Kang!

7
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,250
How's the spicy katsu selling?

8
00:00:58,375 --> 00:00:58,958
Very well.

9
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,710
See? I was right!

10
00:01:03,922 --> 00:01:04,964
Mr. Kang!

11
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:05,549
Morning.

12
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:07,384
No problem in these neck of woods?

13
00:01:07,384 --> 00:01:08,343
Nope!

14
00:01:09,511 --> 00:01:11,471
I'm killing it!

15
00:01:13,765 --> 00:01:15,559
Good to see you, Dae-guk!

16
00:01:15,559 --> 00:01:19,396
I sold this valet business to
your boss, you know that?

17
00:01:19,396 --> 00:01:20,730
Seriously?

18
00:01:26,236 --> 00:01:27,571
Dae-guk, going somewhere?

19
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:28,238
To meet you.

20
00:01:28,238 --> 00:01:30,199
Since you open only during the day,

21
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,033
you should open a bar at night.

22
00:01:37,581 --> 00:01:39,624
Yo! Dae-guk!

23
00:01:39,624 --> 00:01:41,125
Hey, Sook!

24
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:43,212
Korea's national comedian, Sook!

25
00:01:43,212 --> 00:01:44,254
Who's your friend?

26
00:01:44,254 --> 00:01:46,340
Oh yeah, her name is Han-bi,

27
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,966
she's training to be an idol.

28
00:01:47,966 --> 00:01:48,592
Hey there.

29
00:01:48,592 --> 00:01:50,302
Good morning, I'm Han-bi.

30
00:01:50,302 --> 00:01:51,177
Good, good, train hard.

31
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:52,971
It'll do you good to know me here.

32
00:01:52,971 --> 00:01:55,098
If you need anything,
just let me know, got it?

33
00:01:55,098 --> 00:01:56,350
- Dae-guk!
- Yeah?

34
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,726
Can we get a plastic
surgery sponsorship?

35
00:01:57,726 --> 00:01:59,561
Plastic surgery?

36
00:02:00,144 --> 00:02:00,979
No, not that.

37
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:02,189
Come on...

38
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,483
Let's fix her up for the screen.

39
00:02:04,483 --> 00:02:06,568
Don't get plastic surgery,
natural is the best.

40
00:02:06,568 --> 00:02:08,237
Don't ever do that, okay?

41
00:02:08,237 --> 00:02:11,030
If you need anything, call me,
except for plastic surgery.

42
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,865
See you!

43
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,533
- Later!
- Okay!

44
00:02:14,326 --> 00:02:15,994
I don't have his number.

45
00:02:15,994 --> 00:02:17,496
What does he do?

46
00:02:17,621 --> 00:02:19,914
I actually don't know what he does.

47
00:02:20,081 --> 00:02:22,334
<i>He's originally from here,</i>

48
00:02:22,334 --> 00:02:24,419
<i>he always says he does business,</i>

49
00:02:24,461 --> 00:02:26,505
<i>but he doesn't really do much.</i>

50
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:28,840
<i>Still, he's got tons of connections,</i>

51
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,384
<i>so it's good to know him.</i>

52
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:35,054
MEN OF PLASTIC

53
00:02:35,597 --> 00:02:38,600
This is my good friend's business,

54
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,686
I gotta sell this to
cover credit card bills,

55
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:42,812
so help me out.

56
00:02:42,812 --> 00:02:45,399
You're a celebrity with
no work and no money,

57
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:46,608
ever gonna shoot a movie?

58
00:02:46,608 --> 00:02:48,610
I actually have an audition later.

59
00:02:49,611 --> 00:02:51,696
Good morning.

60
00:02:52,781 --> 00:02:54,991
Dude, I'm in an important meeting,

61
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:56,368
let's meet up later.

62
00:02:56,493 --> 00:02:57,827
Sit down for a bit.

63
00:02:58,453 --> 00:02:59,621
Sit down!

64
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:09,047
He has some German medical devices,

65
00:03:09,047 --> 00:03:11,591
and since we're friends,

66
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:14,886
I'll give you the first
dibs, buy it from him.

67
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,055
It's good for you.

68
00:03:17,055 --> 00:03:19,558
Dude, it's not smuggled?

69
00:03:19,683 --> 00:03:21,476
Hell no, of course not.

70
00:03:21,685 --> 00:03:23,895
Come on, it's not smuggled.

71
00:03:23,895 --> 00:03:26,190
It's probably not imported
through official means.

72
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,524
So it is smuggled.

73
00:03:28,358 --> 00:03:29,776
You stupid idiot.

74
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,736
I don't believe it.

75
00:03:31,736 --> 00:03:33,197
Is that important, though?

76
00:03:33,197 --> 00:03:36,616
Do you even know what business I do?

77
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:37,701
How'd I know?

78
00:03:37,701 --> 00:03:41,371
Even gangsters like us
can't do shady dealings.

79
00:03:41,371 --> 00:03:44,374
So buy them off legally with money.

80
00:03:44,374 --> 00:03:46,042
Do it at your home,
shoot laser and shit.

81
00:03:46,042 --> 00:03:48,420
Dude, you're unbelievable.

82
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:50,922
Buy it.

83
00:03:54,008 --> 00:03:55,344
All right.

84
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:58,263
- Stay here for a bit.
- Good, hurry back.

85
00:03:58,597 --> 00:04:00,432
I'll just wait here.

86
00:04:01,015 --> 00:04:01,975
Good.

87
00:04:02,601 --> 00:04:04,394
Dude, so it's smuggled?

88
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:06,646
That's 'smuggling', asshole.

89
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,147
Look over there.

90
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,609
I think Tae-cheon is leaving.

91
00:04:11,025 --> 00:04:13,278
No way, I'm waiting here. He'llâ€¦

92
00:04:13,278 --> 00:04:14,612
I know that guy.

93
00:04:14,779 --> 00:04:16,906
He's a famous plastic surgeon.

94
00:04:18,115 --> 00:04:20,034
- Plastic surgeon?
- Yeah.

95
00:04:20,869 --> 00:04:22,746
Looks like they know each other.

96
00:04:24,956 --> 00:04:29,336
Hey, I'm parking, I'll be right up.

97
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:30,879
Got it.

98
00:04:35,717 --> 00:04:36,968
1 hour.

99
00:04:37,427 --> 00:04:40,180
I'll invest exactly an hour.

100
00:04:40,805 --> 00:04:41,848
Okay.

101
00:04:50,982 --> 00:04:52,942
Welcome.

102
00:04:53,318 --> 00:04:54,194
This way.

103
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:55,570
As director of the clinic,

104
00:04:55,612 --> 00:04:57,447
I'll manage the overall business,

105
00:04:58,282 --> 00:05:02,286
I'll use my guys for small
and standard surgeries,

106
00:05:02,744 --> 00:05:05,622
and you can take over facial
contouring, implants,

107
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,876
and other difficult surgeries.
It'll be a huge hit.

108
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:13,171
I heard you wield the knife well.

109
00:05:13,171 --> 00:05:14,631
Wield the knife?

110
00:05:15,965 --> 00:05:18,552
Isn't that Mr. Jo's area of expertise?

111
00:05:23,265 --> 00:05:25,434
Mr. Jo, I hear what you're saying,

112
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,603
but I didn't come to this meeting

113
00:05:28,645 --> 00:05:31,773
begging for a knife-wielding job.

114
00:05:32,357 --> 00:05:35,026
I came to check if you are capable

115
00:05:35,026 --> 00:05:37,321
of putting wings on my back.

116
00:05:39,864 --> 00:05:43,034
Getting a taste, huh?

117
00:05:43,034 --> 00:05:46,788
I believe that someone with
skill must be respected,

118
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:51,543
treated as such and get
paid according to his worth.

119
00:05:51,543 --> 00:05:54,713
Of course! You're so right!

120
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:58,174
Ji-woo, let me pour you a drink.

121
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:01,010
One moment.

122
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,804
I'll drink it instead.

123
00:06:07,226 --> 00:06:08,852
Tae-cheon, you left?

124
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,438
Dude, you followed me?

125
00:06:11,521 --> 00:06:14,566
You gotta see the merchandise first.

126
00:06:14,816 --> 00:06:17,110
Look it over and buy it tomorrow.

127
00:06:17,527 --> 00:06:20,530
Did you just scoff? Did
I just hear you scoff?

128
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,073
Tae-cheon.

129
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,074
Don't sit down!

130
00:06:23,157 --> 00:06:25,410
- What was that?
- Come, come here.

131
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,578
I'm chatting with him.

132
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,580
Come, come over here for a sec.

133
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:29,873
- Tae-cheon...
- Over there.

134
00:06:29,873 --> 00:06:31,625
- Christ.
- What was that?

135
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,502
Why did you randomly drop in?

136
00:06:33,502 --> 00:06:35,295
Tae-cheon's doing business.

137
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:38,047
I have something to discuss with him.

138
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:39,383
What's with you?

139
00:06:39,508 --> 00:06:41,551
What the hell is he up to?

140
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,803
He's starting a plastic
surgery business.

141
00:06:44,012 --> 00:06:45,430
Plastic surgery?

142
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,766
You know he manages 9 buildings.

143
00:06:47,891 --> 00:06:51,019
I heard they're all owned by
China's Wong or whatever.

144
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:55,106
A private clinic is among them,
and he's expanding it.

145
00:06:55,857 --> 00:06:58,652
That's why he's starting a
plastic surgery business?

146
00:06:58,902 --> 00:07:02,489
He's greasing that young
bloke for that reason.

147
00:07:02,531 --> 00:07:04,073
I can tell with one look.

148
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,243
He'll probably be used
as a ghost surgeon.

149
00:07:07,202 --> 00:07:10,622
That's what they're doing?
A ghost surgeon, eh?

150
00:07:11,456 --> 00:07:12,874
You know?

151
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,419
No, what is it?

152
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,005
Secretly doing surgery on
someone else's patient.

153
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:23,927
I've seen him somewhere.

154
00:07:26,095 --> 00:07:29,224
Park Jae-woo, right?

155
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,518
Okay, I got it.

156
00:07:31,726 --> 00:07:34,896
I told you I was in an
important meeting.

157
00:07:35,605 --> 00:07:38,733
Why do you keep texting and calling?

158
00:07:39,318 --> 00:07:42,654
Will I magically produce
money if you do that?

159
00:07:42,821 --> 00:07:45,156
You sure act like a loanshark.

160
00:07:45,782 --> 00:07:47,284
What? Hello?

161
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:50,829
If I'm screwed, you are too!

162
00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:54,833
If you want to get paid, send
some good vibes instead!

163
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,755
Wait, wait.

164
00:08:01,923 --> 00:08:06,345
Aren't you Park Jae-woo's
brother, Park Ji-woo?

165
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:08,054
Who are you?

166
00:08:08,137 --> 00:08:10,849
It's me, Dae-guk, don't you remember?

167
00:08:11,015 --> 00:08:12,767
I was the top dog at your bro's school.

168
00:08:12,976 --> 00:08:14,143
I visited your home many times!

169
00:08:14,143 --> 00:08:16,646
I was in complex 81, and you were 84.

170
00:08:16,938 --> 00:08:20,484
You were just a little kid,
pooping in your pants.

171
00:08:21,109 --> 00:08:22,736
All grown up.

172
00:08:22,986 --> 00:08:23,487
Yeah...

173
00:08:23,487 --> 00:08:26,323
Hold on, dude, is your mom well?

174
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:27,491
See you again.

175
00:08:27,491 --> 00:08:29,576
Hold up, are you busy?

176
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:33,036
Oh yeah, you're a doctor, you must be.

177
00:08:33,497 --> 00:08:36,790
I'm so happy to see you,
I'll give you something nice.

178
00:08:37,376 --> 00:08:39,461
Here, my business card.

179
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:42,296
Let's grab a drink sometime.

180
00:08:42,296 --> 00:08:44,299
Call me if you need anything, got it?

181
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:46,385
I doâ€¦

182
00:08:46,385 --> 00:08:47,636
business.

183
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,806
Big business!

184
00:08:51,973 --> 00:08:53,808
VP Kang Dae-guk?

185
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,977
FC Barcelona Futsal?

186
00:08:56,728 --> 00:08:58,647
What a load of shit.

187
00:09:09,324 --> 00:09:10,909
Ji-woo, are you leaving?

188
00:09:10,909 --> 00:09:12,118
Yes, time's up.

189
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:13,620
Ji-woo!

190
00:09:13,912 --> 00:09:16,290
That filler clinic from before,

191
00:09:16,331 --> 00:09:18,625
they really want to meet you.

192
00:09:19,543 --> 00:09:21,253
Give them a call.

193
00:09:25,215 --> 00:09:26,966
Hong Kyu-ok...

194
00:09:28,927 --> 00:09:29,969
Okay.

195
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:32,013
Bye.

196
00:09:47,946 --> 00:09:50,156
Doctor, good to see you.

197
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,116
- Have you been well?
- Yes, of course.

198
00:09:52,284 --> 00:09:54,203
- Any mail?
- Yes.

199
00:09:56,538 --> 00:09:57,622
<i>P&K Plastic Surgery</i>

200
00:09:57,622 --> 00:09:59,333
<i>Director Dr. Park Ji-woo
Co-director Dr. Kim Sol</i>

201
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,294
You really should change your address.

202
00:10:03,127 --> 00:10:05,255
- I'll take care of it.
- Sure thing.

203
00:10:05,714 --> 00:10:06,590
It's really dusty here.

204
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:09,468
Sure, take care!

205
00:10:10,969 --> 00:10:12,095
Who is he?

206
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,097
Ex-director of this clinic.

207
00:10:14,223 --> 00:10:16,850
He still thinks he owns this place.

208
00:10:17,601 --> 00:10:20,479
This is his profile I managed
when he was a hotshot.

209
00:10:20,562 --> 00:10:22,481
You're managing my profile too, right?

210
00:10:22,481 --> 00:10:23,732
What a pile of dog shit,

211
00:10:23,732 --> 00:10:25,317
where would I ever use yours?

212
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,277
At least pay your bar tab.

213
00:10:27,277 --> 00:10:28,820
I will, when I make it big.

214
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,113
I'll never get it then.

215
00:10:30,113 --> 00:10:32,156
Do you still work as a matchmaker?

216
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:33,783
- Matchmaker?
- Yeah.

217
00:10:33,908 --> 00:10:35,994
- You're really pissing me off.
- Why?

218
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,746
Cupid agent!

219
00:10:37,746 --> 00:10:38,330
Same shit.

220
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:42,584
Because of big corporations
gobbling up all my clients,

221
00:10:42,584 --> 00:10:44,586
I'm helping out at the wine bar

222
00:10:44,628 --> 00:10:46,463
to maintain my connections.

223
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:50,384
Ji-woo graduated top
of his medical school.

224
00:10:51,301 --> 00:10:53,177
What's more important

225
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,890
is that his skill is
among Korea's best.

226
00:10:57,182 --> 00:10:59,476
<i>The basics of surgery is
the separation technique,</i>

227
00:10:59,476 --> 00:11:01,436
<i>separating skin from the muscles</i>

228
00:11:01,478 --> 00:11:02,979
<i>accurately and quickly.</i>

229
00:11:03,355 --> 00:11:05,190
The pinnacle of plastic surgery.

230
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:08,693
Then you pull the separated
skin as much as possible,

231
00:11:08,985 --> 00:11:13,031
cut off the remaining
skin, and extract the fat,

232
00:11:13,198 --> 00:11:16,285
<i>and stitch them back together.</i>

233
00:11:16,451 --> 00:11:19,371
<i>- That's the highlight of a face lift.</i>
- Incredible...

234
00:11:20,539 --> 00:11:22,332
I don't really follow, then what?

235
00:11:22,332 --> 00:11:24,584
Then the jaw line comes alive

236
00:11:24,626 --> 00:11:27,212
even without double-jaw surgery.

237
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:28,713
Like me.

238
00:11:28,713 --> 00:11:30,965
They did a really good job on you.

239
00:11:30,965 --> 00:11:32,342
She looked like me before.

240
00:11:32,551 --> 00:11:33,802
- She had work done on her?
- Sure.

241
00:11:33,802 --> 00:11:37,347
Too bad for him, he had
surgical hit job done on him,

242
00:11:37,556 --> 00:11:39,140
and he got screwed.

243
00:11:39,474 --> 00:11:40,975
What's that?

244
00:11:41,393 --> 00:11:44,396
It's a tactic done on young
and hotshot doctors.

245
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:47,065
<i>When Ji-woo was opening his clinic,</i>

246
00:11:47,316 --> 00:11:49,901
<i>he pulled money from everywhere,</i>

247
00:11:49,901 --> 00:11:51,653
<i>including loansharks.</i>

248
00:11:51,653 --> 00:11:53,363
<i>He was a bit greedy.</i>

249
00:11:53,363 --> 00:11:56,866
<i>Someone lured one of the
nurses to steal propofol,</i>

250
00:11:56,866 --> 00:11:59,619
<i>and framed him for it.</i>

251
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:02,289
<i>He lost his medical license,
and his clinic as well.</i>

252
00:12:03,415 --> 00:12:05,500
Due to the shock, his
mother passed away.

253
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:09,170
He's still paying off the
debt from those days.

254
00:12:09,254 --> 00:12:10,922
Until you get your license back...

255
00:12:10,922 --> 00:12:13,758
You're doing the surgery right now.

256
00:12:13,758 --> 00:12:15,719
If something goes wrong,
you're responsible.

257
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:16,845
I mean...

258
00:12:16,845 --> 00:12:17,721
Man!

259
00:12:17,721 --> 00:12:18,972
What was that?

260
00:12:19,264 --> 00:12:20,682
You got a text.

261
00:12:22,058 --> 00:12:26,771
Ji-woo, you should do
ghost surgeries regularly,

262
00:12:26,771 --> 00:12:27,856
<i>Payment is overdue. Good luck!</i>

263
00:12:27,856 --> 00:12:29,148
And open a new clinic later.

264
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:30,525
He's been backstabbed so much

265
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:31,901
that he's got trust issues.

266
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:33,945
You guys are friends now?

267
00:12:33,945 --> 00:12:35,530
He's my friend's brother,

268
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:38,408
and since when were you
two on a first name basis?

269
00:12:40,118 --> 00:12:42,329
It'll take 2 years for him
to get his license back.

270
00:12:42,746 --> 00:12:45,457
It looked like Dr. Jang
is greasing his junior

271
00:12:45,457 --> 00:12:46,416
to speed it up.

272
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,376
His junior?

273
00:12:47,376 --> 00:12:49,503
Yeah, I took him on as a client

274
00:12:49,544 --> 00:12:51,421
because Dr. Jang asked me,

275
00:12:52,464 --> 00:12:54,132
this is him, he's an uptight type.

276
00:12:54,132 --> 00:12:55,509
<i>Choi Sang-hyun
Ministry of Health</i>

277
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:57,135
It's taking too long.

278
00:12:57,302 --> 00:12:59,053
It's easy to get the license back.

279
00:12:59,137 --> 00:13:01,181
Look, Ji-woo's here.

280
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:03,642
He's getting jacked by the loansharks.

281
00:13:03,725 --> 00:13:07,604
Damn, small world, eh?

282
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,883
Our clinic is exclusively
for VIP members,

283
00:13:37,342 --> 00:13:39,886
so the aesthetic shop closes at 6 PM,

284
00:13:40,178 --> 00:13:42,306
and treatment starts at 9.

285
00:13:43,432 --> 00:13:47,352
It could be a better deal
than being a ghost surgeon.

286
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:51,356
Word will spread quickly.

287
00:13:51,606 --> 00:13:53,149
How do you manage security?

288
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:55,902
Our clientele includes
the wives of district chiefs,

289
00:13:55,944 --> 00:13:57,070
the police commissioner,

290
00:13:57,987 --> 00:14:00,407
and lovers of high-ranking officials.

291
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,117
Sit down.

292
00:14:04,286 --> 00:14:05,829
I'm okay.

293
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:12,252
But to work here, you'll need
to do some milk delivery.

294
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:14,421
I thought I'd only be
doing filler treatments.

295
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:15,797
That's part of the job,

296
00:14:15,964 --> 00:14:19,384
you know VIPs often have
amnesia because of stress.

297
00:14:19,384 --> 00:14:21,553
You'll be visiting
their homes to help...

298
00:14:21,553 --> 00:14:22,596
Excuse me.

299
00:14:22,971 --> 00:14:26,766
I think you need a drug
dealer more than a doctor.

300
00:14:27,351 --> 00:14:30,103
Isn't that why we're having a meeting?

301
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,039
Christ...

302
00:14:57,256 --> 00:14:58,215
Ji-woo!

303
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,925
We'll be best friends at this rate.

304
00:15:01,593 --> 00:15:03,428
Why do you keep making me...

305
00:15:03,428 --> 00:15:05,180
What? What?!

306
00:15:07,766 --> 00:15:09,393
Hey, man.

307
00:15:10,101 --> 00:15:11,311
What's going on?

308
00:15:11,436 --> 00:15:14,273
Did I startle you? Come sit down.

309
00:15:14,731 --> 00:15:16,149
You know these guys.

310
00:15:16,691 --> 00:15:18,943
They're my boys!

311
00:15:19,611 --> 00:15:21,238
Ki-cheol, I boxed with him,

312
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,072
and Sung-jae, he wrestled.

313
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:24,616
I'm not curious at all.

314
00:15:24,908 --> 00:15:28,245
Ji-woo is practically my
own brother, got it?

315
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:29,037
Okay.

316
00:15:29,037 --> 00:15:30,705
I heard he borrowed some money,

317
00:15:30,747 --> 00:15:32,332
can you sort it out for him?

318
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:35,126
- Excuse me?
- Listen.

319
00:15:35,126 --> 00:15:36,878
- We'll delay payment by 6 months,
- Very good.

320
00:15:36,878 --> 00:15:38,713
And we'll just take the
principal and call it even.

321
00:15:39,714 --> 00:15:41,425
Just the principal payment.

322
00:15:43,092 --> 00:15:44,303
All right, I hear you.

323
00:15:44,303 --> 00:15:46,054
Let's give him a bit more time.

324
00:15:47,597 --> 00:15:48,557
One sec.

325
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:49,933
1 year, let's go with 1 year.

326
00:15:49,933 --> 00:15:50,767
Very well, sir.

327
00:15:50,892 --> 00:15:52,269
Good, very good.

328
00:15:52,394 --> 00:15:54,646
Is that good?

329
00:15:55,314 --> 00:15:56,523
I know how you feel.

330
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,192
- Sung-jae.
- Yes, boss.

331
00:15:58,442 --> 00:15:59,693
He's older than you.

332
00:15:59,943 --> 00:16:02,028
Take good care of him, he's only 27.

333
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:03,863
I'll treat you as my brother.

334
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:05,490
Please don't.

335
00:16:06,074 --> 00:16:08,410
I waited until you got here,
so we can eat together.

336
00:16:08,577 --> 00:16:10,078
Dig in!

337
00:16:12,206 --> 00:16:14,874
We'll just say hello and leave.

338
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,668
We won't stay long, okay?

339
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:20,589
This is a soiree for Mi-jung's clients,

340
00:16:21,005 --> 00:16:23,132
it'll be a big help to you.

341
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,469
There he is!

342
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,679
Ministry of Health, Mr. Choi.

343
00:16:29,348 --> 00:16:30,557
Mr. Choi?

344
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,810
Yes, Mr. Choi, come with me.

345
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,271
I recently found out
about Mr. Choi here,

346
00:16:36,271 --> 00:16:37,856
he works at the Ministry of Health.

347
00:16:38,607 --> 00:16:40,149
You work at a health center?

348
00:16:40,317 --> 00:16:41,401
You nuts?

349
00:16:41,443 --> 00:16:42,611
He's a civil servant.

350
00:16:42,986 --> 00:16:45,405
Anyway, this guy right here,

351
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,031
half of this country's workload

352
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:48,617
has to go through his approval.

353
00:16:48,617 --> 00:16:51,453
- That is incredible!
- No, of course not!

354
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,038
Hey, Ji-woo, Ji-woo?

355
00:16:54,038 --> 00:16:54,748
Yes?

356
00:16:54,748 --> 00:16:56,165
Pour Mr. Choi a drink.

357
00:16:56,165 --> 00:16:58,252
- Pour him a drink!
- Please...

358
00:16:58,252 --> 00:17:00,003
You guys can be blood brothers.

359
00:17:00,003 --> 00:17:02,088
You too are the same age?

360
00:17:02,171 --> 00:17:04,006
What the hell?

361
00:17:04,048 --> 00:17:06,759
Could we do that?

362
00:17:07,302 --> 00:17:08,428
Go on, do it.

363
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:09,804
Yes, of course.

364
00:17:09,804 --> 00:17:10,930
Mi-jung!

365
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:14,726
Get him some freebie
skin care treatments?

366
00:17:14,726 --> 00:17:15,935
Mind your own business, dipshit.

367
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:17,312
Let's all have a drink!

368
00:17:17,312 --> 00:17:18,938
Right, raise your glasses!

369
00:17:19,021 --> 00:17:22,692
For Mr. Choi!

370
00:17:22,984 --> 00:17:24,361
Had we met earlier,

371
00:17:24,402 --> 00:17:27,405
I could've sorted
everything out, right?

372
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:30,575
- I'm really thankful...
- Go on.

373
00:17:30,784 --> 00:17:35,163
But do you want something from me?

374
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:37,457
Well, I...

375
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,710
how could I put this delicately?

376
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,298
Right, this is what I do best.

377
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:51,471
If this cigarette needs a
lighter, I hook one up for it,

378
00:17:52,055 --> 00:17:58,061
and if it needs an
ashtray, I hook it up.

379
00:17:58,312 --> 00:18:00,146
That's what I do best.

380
00:18:00,397 --> 00:18:05,902
So, this time, I want to
hook you up with me.

381
00:18:06,361 --> 00:18:07,487
What?

382
00:18:09,573 --> 00:18:12,033
I'm starting a plastic
surgery business.

383
00:18:12,451 --> 00:18:14,369
And if I partner up with you,

384
00:18:16,037 --> 00:18:17,664
it will be blissful.

385
00:18:17,872 --> 00:18:19,374
Think about it,

386
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:22,669
you gotta work hard and
get your clinic back.

387
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:24,963
How long will you live in a rental

388
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:26,756
and get hassled by thugs?

389
00:18:27,257 --> 00:18:31,303
Those who tasted Apgujeong
can never leave here.

390
00:18:31,636 --> 00:18:35,014
Can you drop your pride
and move to the outskirts?

391
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:37,058
You can't.

392
00:18:37,934 --> 00:18:40,562
- Are you listening?
- Well, yes...

393
00:18:40,937 --> 00:18:42,772
I'm so thankful for everything...

394
00:18:42,772 --> 00:18:43,940
Yes, yes.

395
00:18:44,107 --> 00:18:46,276
But I really don't know you yet.

396
00:18:46,276 --> 00:18:49,196
It's too soon to have
this conversation...

397
00:18:49,571 --> 00:18:50,989
- Mi-jung!
- Yeah?

398
00:18:50,989 --> 00:18:52,574
Didn't Mr. Choi leave something?

399
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:54,659
Oh yeah, he did.

400
00:18:56,703 --> 00:18:59,080
Good, why didn't you
give this to me earlier?

401
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,457
This is for you.

402
00:19:02,334 --> 00:19:03,710
Open it.

403
00:19:10,925 --> 00:19:13,094
Oops, I don't smoke.

404
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,474
Surgeon License

405
00:19:19,768 --> 00:19:21,060
How did you...

406
00:19:21,228 --> 00:19:23,897
If one wants to work with
an amazing man like you,

407
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:26,191
isn't this the minimum
amount of effort?

408
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:29,736
Ji-woo, this is who I am.

409
00:19:30,695 --> 00:19:32,239
Know what I mean?

410
00:19:32,697 --> 00:19:36,660
I want to know what you mean.

411
00:19:44,709 --> 00:19:47,337
<i>Kim Sol Plastic Surgery</i>

412
00:19:53,885 --> 00:19:55,679
Wait for it, you bastard.

413
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,890
Sir, could you raise the volume?

414
00:19:59,391 --> 00:20:00,434
Okay!

415
00:20:06,856 --> 00:20:08,358
Yes, Dr. Park.

416
00:20:10,068 --> 00:20:13,613
I heard about the stakes from Dae-guk.

417
00:20:13,988 --> 00:20:16,283
Yes, let's do it that way.

418
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:18,827
Let's meet up soon.

419
00:20:20,537 --> 00:20:22,747
How did you take care of Park Ji-woo?

420
00:20:22,914 --> 00:20:25,459
He only listens to me.

421
00:20:28,337 --> 00:20:30,046
Anyway, thank you.

422
00:20:31,089 --> 00:20:32,799
I'll have to pay you for your service.

423
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,050
Hey, hey.

424
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,553
I took care of it because
you're like my little brother.

425
00:20:36,553 --> 00:20:38,180
Not for money.

426
00:20:39,473 --> 00:20:41,808
I almost made a big mistake.

427
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:43,393
You almost did.

428
00:20:45,937 --> 00:20:47,356
What do you want?

429
00:20:49,065 --> 00:20:50,734
You clue in so quickly.

430
00:20:50,942 --> 00:20:54,070
Let's partner up now.

431
00:20:57,532 --> 00:20:59,826
You really think you could work for me

432
00:20:59,868 --> 00:21:01,495
as a gangster at your age?

433
00:21:02,078 --> 00:21:05,164
Why'd I want to be a
gangster, ass licker.

434
00:21:05,457 --> 00:21:07,376
I'm talking about the
plastic surgery business.

435
00:21:07,376 --> 00:21:10,003
You know, Wong's 15-floor building?

436
00:21:10,003 --> 00:21:12,046
Let's turn the entire thing
into a plastic surgery center.

437
00:21:12,046 --> 00:21:14,591
Put surgery, skin care,
pharmacy and everything,

438
00:21:14,674 --> 00:21:16,843
and make it impossible for
people not to spend money.

439
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:19,638
Incredible, eh? You feel me?

440
00:21:19,638 --> 00:21:21,223
Stop your bullshit

441
00:21:21,265 --> 00:21:24,518
and take the money for your trouble.

442
00:21:25,394 --> 00:21:28,522
Will you give that shit a rest?!

443
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:39,324
Dude, I'm not the same
Jo Tae-cheon as before.

444
00:21:39,616 --> 00:21:42,911
If the old you glared at me like that,

445
00:21:42,911 --> 00:21:44,579
you'd get whipped.

446
00:21:47,457 --> 00:21:50,084
Anyway, I'll do my best,
that's all there is, right?

447
00:21:50,669 --> 00:21:52,212
Thanks, Tae-cheon.

448
00:21:53,129 --> 00:21:54,047
Here.

449
00:21:55,299 --> 00:21:56,383
Don't want it?

450
00:21:57,259 --> 00:21:58,718
I'm off!

451
00:22:04,224 --> 00:22:08,102
How could you sell my home
without asking me first?

452
00:22:08,562 --> 00:22:09,688
Someone's moving in now!

453
00:22:09,688 --> 00:22:12,148
You say you'll buy whenever
it comes on the market,

454
00:22:12,148 --> 00:22:13,483
how many years have I heard that?

455
00:22:13,483 --> 00:22:15,319
It's not like you're
bringing me a deposit,

456
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:17,821
how can you just
tell me not to sell it?

457
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:20,449
That's my home, it was
originally my home!

458
00:22:20,449 --> 00:22:22,033
I've been living there for so long!

459
00:22:22,033 --> 00:22:24,160
I was there since that
apartment was built!

460
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,330
You lived there until 1997.

461
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:28,957
But not anymore, what
is the matter with you!

462
00:22:28,957 --> 00:22:32,043
I can't trust anyone around here!

463
00:22:32,336 --> 00:22:34,921
How long have you known my family?!

464
00:22:34,921 --> 00:22:36,215
You know what I mean?

465
00:22:36,215 --> 00:22:37,048
Yes, of course.

466
00:22:37,048 --> 00:22:39,926
He's the weird one, you
backstabbing snake!

467
00:22:40,093 --> 00:22:43,347
Fine, I'm buying it next time for sure,

468
00:22:43,513 --> 00:22:46,015
but I'll sign with the
next door realtor!

469
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:48,101
Goddammit!

470
00:22:49,603 --> 00:22:51,813
Stop! I'm walking here.

471
00:22:52,063 --> 00:22:54,691
Dr. Jang, Ji-woo told
me so much about you.

472
00:22:55,108 --> 00:22:59,529
He couldn't stop talking
good things about you.

473
00:23:00,029 --> 00:23:03,116
Now that we're on the
same boat, I'll do my best.

474
00:23:03,325 --> 00:23:07,246
From equipment,
medicine and even interior,

475
00:23:07,246 --> 00:23:08,872
you'll handle all that?

476
00:23:09,748 --> 00:23:11,291
That's possible?

477
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:16,463
Head of admin isn't a
position anyone can just take.

478
00:23:16,588 --> 00:23:18,798
He's not just anyone.

479
00:23:19,716 --> 00:23:21,385
Unlike someone who just yaps.

480
00:23:21,635 --> 00:23:23,678
He'll do well.

481
00:23:23,887 --> 00:23:26,348
I'll back him up, so don't worry.

482
00:23:26,515 --> 00:23:30,018
I'll do my absolute best, sir.

483
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:36,775
What about a drinking game?
Who wants to start off?

484
00:23:38,943 --> 00:23:40,737
Me!

485
00:23:43,573 --> 00:23:45,242
Dr. Jang!

486
00:23:47,744 --> 00:23:48,912
Mr. Jo.

487
00:23:49,162 --> 00:23:51,456
Two of us sucking Ji-woo dry is enough,

488
00:23:51,623 --> 00:23:53,958
why bring that useless
bastard into the mix?

489
00:23:54,293 --> 00:23:57,170
I'll take care of him, so don't worry.

490
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,963
I'll sort it out soon.

491
00:24:09,224 --> 00:24:12,852
You still live at Hyundae Apartment?

492
00:24:12,852 --> 00:24:14,979
No, the commercial area.

493
00:24:15,772 --> 00:24:17,691
Ji-woo, come in.

494
00:24:17,691 --> 00:24:19,734
This is my office and living quarters.

495
00:24:19,901 --> 00:24:21,445
I've been living alone for a while now.

496
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,905
Cancer got my wife,
just like your brother.

497
00:24:23,905 --> 00:24:25,740
Blood cancer's scary.

498
00:24:25,865 --> 00:24:28,034
I got a bottle that I
stole from Mi-jung.

499
00:24:28,452 --> 00:24:29,536
Where is it?

500
00:24:29,828 --> 00:24:32,747
Mr. Kang, I'll just stay for an hour.

501
00:24:32,831 --> 00:24:34,916
Don't mister me, just call me 'bro'.

502
00:24:34,916 --> 00:24:36,084
It's right here!

503
00:24:37,586 --> 00:24:38,628
Tada!

504
00:24:40,922 --> 00:24:42,841
What the hell now?

505
00:24:45,844 --> 00:24:48,054
Barcelona Futsal...

506
00:24:48,054 --> 00:24:50,390
When Barcelona was building
an indoor soccer field,

507
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:53,185
they said Messi would
come, total bullshit.

508
00:24:53,185 --> 00:24:55,437
- Why'd he come?
- Maybe he'll eventually.

509
00:24:55,437 --> 00:24:58,064
Anyway, we gotta make it big.

510
00:24:58,064 --> 00:25:02,527
I'm gonna rebuy my home
and live with my daughter.

511
00:25:02,777 --> 00:25:05,280
It was originally my home,
you know what I mean?

512
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,531
I don't know.

513
00:25:06,531 --> 00:25:08,450
If only I wasn't targeted
by the surgical hit job...

514
00:25:08,533 --> 00:25:09,784
Know what I mean?

515
00:25:10,202 --> 00:25:11,661
I know exactly what you mean.

516
00:25:11,745 --> 00:25:14,373
If only it wasn't for
that hit job, shit...

517
00:25:14,456 --> 00:25:16,666
- Sons of bitches...
- Sons of bitches...

518
00:25:16,666 --> 00:25:19,043
You gotta listen to
the natives like me,

519
00:25:19,085 --> 00:25:20,712
everyone else is a scammer.

520
00:25:20,712 --> 00:25:23,047
That's right, they're
all trying to use you.

521
00:25:23,047 --> 00:25:24,883
That's what I'm saying!

522
00:25:24,883 --> 00:25:27,677
This is why pure people
like us have to succeed.

523
00:25:27,969 --> 00:25:29,888
That would be a just world.

524
00:25:30,972 --> 00:25:32,891
I have to get through this life

525
00:25:32,932 --> 00:25:35,018
relying only on myself, you know?

526
00:25:35,018 --> 00:25:37,229
I'm the only one I can trust.

527
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,066
Why only you? You got me now.

528
00:25:45,362 --> 00:25:46,613
But do you trust me?

529
00:25:46,613 --> 00:25:49,408
One look and I can read
them inside and out.

530
00:25:49,491 --> 00:25:50,909
You're different.

531
00:25:51,368 --> 00:25:52,869
You're deep.

532
00:25:53,161 --> 00:25:55,497
- Deep?
- I'm wide.

533
00:25:55,497 --> 00:25:57,874
When we partner up, we'll hit it big.

534
00:25:57,916 --> 00:25:59,668
That's true collaboration!

535
00:26:07,509 --> 00:26:08,302
Stop staring, bro.

536
00:26:08,302 --> 00:26:11,221
Sorry, I stared too long.

537
00:26:11,221 --> 00:26:12,847
Let's have a drink and re-energize.

538
00:26:12,847 --> 00:26:15,016
Uh, what wasâ€¦ your name?

539
00:26:15,016 --> 00:26:15,475
Park Ji-woo.

540
00:26:15,475 --> 00:26:18,353
Ji-woo, Ji-woo, sorry, I blanked out.

541
00:26:18,353 --> 00:26:20,230
I keep forgetting.

542
00:26:20,814 --> 00:26:21,940
This is a really good wine.

543
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,942
I heard it's a really famous wine,

544
00:26:23,983 --> 00:26:25,319
it's made with grapes.

545
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:27,196
All wines are made with grapes.

546
00:26:27,196 --> 00:26:28,697
Yeah?

547
00:26:28,697 --> 00:26:31,325
<i>Jang Won-seok Plastic Surgery</i>

548
00:26:32,409 --> 00:26:34,035
As you can see in the list,

549
00:26:34,118 --> 00:26:36,913
no one else can get
that price except me.

550
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:40,417
Do you even know what it means,

551
00:26:40,417 --> 00:26:42,627
when you're buying
equipment at these prices?

552
00:26:44,546 --> 00:26:46,298
That I'm frugal?

553
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,593
Buying something at less
than half the original price

554
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,761
means one of two things:

555
00:26:52,136 --> 00:26:53,305
either they're faulty,

556
00:26:53,805 --> 00:26:55,890
or you fiddled with the
list to pocket some money.

557
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,976
Dr. Jang, how could you say that?

558
00:26:57,976 --> 00:27:00,854
Ji-woo, what's your take on
this? You must've seen it.

559
00:27:00,854 --> 00:27:02,772
I can't really tell just by
looking at the numbers,

560
00:27:02,772 --> 00:27:04,483
but I think you're being too uptight

561
00:27:04,524 --> 00:27:05,692
to accuse him over this.

562
00:27:05,692 --> 00:27:06,693
Right.

563
00:27:06,693 --> 00:27:08,278
Park Ji-woo!

564
00:27:08,612 --> 00:27:11,365
You're an unlicensed
nobody when I took you in!

565
00:27:11,365 --> 00:27:13,116
And now what?

566
00:27:13,116 --> 00:27:15,910
Nobody? You can't even
perform a surgery without me.

567
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,537
You goddamn ungrateful bastard!

568
00:27:17,579 --> 00:27:18,913
Come over here, asshole!

569
00:27:19,163 --> 00:27:21,833
Hold still, don't do that!

570
00:27:22,166 --> 00:27:23,167
Is Dr. Jang in? He's inside?

571
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,378
Doctor, why are you leaving?

572
00:27:24,378 --> 00:27:27,547
- Bring him out! Now!
- What's going on?

573
00:27:27,547 --> 00:27:29,132
Something's going on, go check it out.

574
00:27:31,301 --> 00:27:34,971
Dr. Jang, of all people,
you dare to scam me?!

575
00:27:35,472 --> 00:27:37,516
I'm Mi-jung, you hear me?

576
00:27:37,807 --> 00:27:39,268
What are you talking about?

577
00:27:39,393 --> 00:27:41,728
What are you gonna do with them?

578
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:44,273
They have to get married,
you're responsible!

579
00:27:44,898 --> 00:27:47,401
Ladies, could you take
off your sunglasses?

580
00:27:48,318 --> 00:27:50,570
Look, they can't close their eyes!

581
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:52,614
They have to sleep
with their eyes open!

582
00:27:52,614 --> 00:27:54,741
- I did that?
- Who else then?!

583
00:27:54,741 --> 00:27:56,368
You're responsible!

584
00:27:56,618 --> 00:27:57,536
Let's talk inside, come on.

585
00:27:57,536 --> 00:27:59,621
Go where? What's there to talk about?

586
00:27:59,621 --> 00:28:01,290
The entire situation is right here!

587
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:02,957
This won't do, call the cops.

588
00:28:02,957 --> 00:28:05,294
Ms. Kim, what are you doing?
We're better than this.

589
00:28:05,294 --> 00:28:07,587
And what exactly are we? Let go of me!

590
00:28:07,587 --> 00:28:11,049
Do you even know who my clients are?!

591
00:28:11,341 --> 00:28:12,467
My apologies.

592
00:28:12,467 --> 00:28:13,593
- Let go of me.
- Please come in.

593
00:28:13,593 --> 00:28:14,553
All right.

594
00:28:14,553 --> 00:28:17,764
I'm sorry, this was due
to my carelessness.

595
00:28:18,432 --> 00:28:19,849
What the shit.

596
00:28:20,809 --> 00:28:24,521
Dae-guk, why are you
coming out of there?

597
00:28:28,733 --> 00:28:29,734
Dae-guk.

598
00:28:29,734 --> 00:28:33,071
Those girls have their wedding dates.

599
00:28:33,447 --> 00:28:35,240
If their weddings get cancelled,

600
00:28:35,282 --> 00:28:36,700
I'm done as a matchmaker!

601
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,452
Calm down and drink your coffee.

602
00:28:38,452 --> 00:28:43,540
No, even if it's your clinic,
I can't settle this one.

603
00:28:43,748 --> 00:28:47,586
I'm going to sue that bastard Jang.

604
00:28:47,586 --> 00:28:50,171
Don't try to talk me down.

605
00:28:50,589 --> 00:28:52,131
You definitely should.

606
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,301
What?

607
00:28:54,301 --> 00:28:55,719
And do it quickly.

608
00:28:56,803 --> 00:29:00,765
Quack doctor Jang Won-seok!
Resign! Resign!

609
00:29:00,932 --> 00:29:04,394
Resign! Resign!

610
00:29:04,394 --> 00:29:08,857
Mi-jung is spiteful, so
she won't let this one go.

611
00:29:08,982 --> 00:29:09,941
Shit...

612
00:29:09,941 --> 00:29:11,485
She's a famous matchmaker,

613
00:29:11,526 --> 00:29:13,570
so she knows all the deep pockets,

614
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:15,572
and let's say you open with Dr. Kang,

615
00:29:15,572 --> 00:29:17,532
who will come now with his reputation?

616
00:29:17,741 --> 00:29:19,868
If this reaches Wong or Wang,

617
00:29:19,909 --> 00:29:21,745
he's not gonna stay put.

618
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:22,996
Crap.

619
00:29:24,331 --> 00:29:26,291
You got any ideas?

620
00:29:30,754 --> 00:29:35,925
When a shop gets an upgrade,
the owner should too.

621
00:29:38,303 --> 00:29:42,516
<i>Park Ji-woo Plastic Surgery</i>

622
00:29:45,477 --> 00:29:48,062
Thank you for coming.

623
00:29:48,188 --> 00:29:51,024
We'll become Apgujeong's landmark.

624

625
00:29:52,984 --> 00:29:56,029
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

626
00:29:57,906 --> 00:29:59,991
Our doctor is so handsome!

627
00:29:59,991 --> 00:30:01,159
You're so hot!

628
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:02,869
Good luck, Dr. Park!

629
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:04,037
Cheers!

630
00:30:05,997 --> 00:30:08,500
Oh man...

631
00:30:09,501 --> 00:30:11,503
As the real owner of this place,

632
00:30:11,545 --> 00:30:13,380
that name really bothers me.

633
00:30:14,464 --> 00:30:16,216
Wouldn't it bother everyone

634
00:30:16,258 --> 00:30:19,303
if it was called Jo Tae-cheon
Plastic Surgery?

635
00:30:21,471 --> 00:30:22,931
Indeed.

636
00:30:23,723 --> 00:30:25,809
Tae-cheon! Is Big Dick coming?

637
00:30:26,017 --> 00:30:29,313
Dude, be careful what you say.

638
00:30:29,521 --> 00:30:30,939
What? What did I say?

639
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:33,608
Let me tell you something,

640
00:30:33,942 --> 00:30:36,611
Chairman Wong will never see you,

641
00:30:36,653 --> 00:30:38,613
so don't bother trying.

642
00:30:38,822 --> 00:30:40,365
Why? Why?

643
00:30:40,574 --> 00:30:41,408
Why do you think?

644
00:30:41,575 --> 00:30:43,452
Ever seen a mega corp boss

645
00:30:43,493 --> 00:30:45,954
eating with factory floor workers?

646
00:30:46,371 --> 00:30:47,747
Even if you do see him,

647
00:30:47,789 --> 00:30:50,625
don't bother bringing
up clinic business idea.

648
00:30:51,251 --> 00:30:52,669
Screw you too.

649
00:30:52,794 --> 00:30:55,464
Mr. Jo, then he won't
ever eat with us too?

650
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:56,423
We're factory workers too.

651
00:30:56,423 --> 00:30:57,757
Park Ji-woo!

652
00:30:57,757 --> 00:31:02,471
How could you do this to me, asshole!

653
00:31:02,471 --> 00:31:05,014
Don't touch me!

654
00:31:05,682 --> 00:31:06,766
No touching!

655
00:31:06,766 --> 00:31:07,976
Get him out!

656
00:31:07,976 --> 00:31:11,605
You think you can play
doctor in this town for long?!

657
00:31:11,771 --> 00:31:15,442
You fat bastard, I hated
you from the start!

658
00:31:15,442 --> 00:31:17,902
Get that bitch! You stupid bitch!

659
00:31:17,902 --> 00:31:21,114
That nasty little man...

660
00:31:36,921 --> 00:31:38,131
Everyone's gone.

661
00:31:38,131 --> 00:31:39,132
Good work today.

662
00:31:39,132 --> 00:31:41,468
When will we clean up this mess?

663
00:31:42,135 --> 00:31:44,053
Don't you love this emperor chair?

664
00:31:44,053 --> 00:31:46,139
Why did you buy this useless thing?

665
00:31:46,223 --> 00:31:47,974
Take a look.

666
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,602
A clinic with your name on it.

667
00:31:50,602 --> 00:31:52,312
In name only.

668
00:31:52,312 --> 00:31:55,774
It's something, this is just the start.

669
00:31:55,774 --> 00:31:57,609
I got a killer idea,

670
00:31:57,651 --> 00:32:00,945
something that has never been done.

671
00:32:01,321 --> 00:32:03,532
<i>We need to first gather people.</i>

672
00:32:03,532 --> 00:32:05,742
<i>What the hell for?</i>

673
00:32:05,742 --> 00:32:09,204
<i>We'll reveal post-surgery
look along with pre-surgery.</i>

674
00:32:09,204 --> 00:32:11,873
<i>"Look how beautiful they turned out!"</i>

675
00:32:11,873 --> 00:32:13,208
<i>We'll show those side by side,</i>

676
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,376
<i>and people will go nuts.</i>

677
00:32:14,459 --> 00:32:15,377
It's just for you.

678
00:32:15,377 --> 00:32:16,795
What about the full face job?

679
00:32:16,795 --> 00:32:17,921
No, not the full face,

680
00:32:17,921 --> 00:32:19,047
- just one part.
- Just one?

681
00:32:19,047 --> 00:32:20,215
Why not do the whole thing?

682
00:32:20,215 --> 00:32:22,091
It's gotta be done by one person

683
00:32:22,133 --> 00:32:23,552
to maintain the balance.

684
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,845
Hello there, it's Oh Mi-jung!

685
00:32:25,845 --> 00:32:27,264
<i>They'll sue and kick up a storm.</i>

686
00:32:27,264 --> 00:32:27,847
<i>Free Surgery Promotion</i>

687
00:32:27,847 --> 00:32:29,183
<i>Who wants to show off pre-surgery look?</i>

688
00:32:29,266 --> 00:32:32,352
<i>That's why we have
to offer a free surgery.</i>

689
00:32:32,352 --> 00:32:33,395
<i>For free?</i>

690
00:32:33,395 --> 00:32:34,396
<i>We need volunteers.</i>

691
00:32:34,396 --> 00:32:38,317
Doctor! It's Dr. Park Ji-woo!

692
00:32:44,906 --> 00:32:48,034
<i>What's past and present in
English? 'Old' and 'Now'?</i>

693
00:32:48,034 --> 00:32:49,160
<i>'Before' and 'After'.</i>

694
00:32:49,286 --> 00:32:52,997
<i>Yeah, that's it, people
will be so curious.</i>

695
00:32:52,997 --> 00:32:55,875
<i>We gotta use that in marketing.</i>

696
00:32:56,251 --> 00:32:56,543
<i>- Will that work?
- Absolutely.</i>

697
00:32:56,543 --> 00:32:58,127
<i>A Brand New Life</i>

698
00:32:58,127 --> 00:32:59,796
This is where they handed out flyers.

699
00:32:59,796 --> 00:33:01,631
Park Ji-woo Plastic Surgery?

700
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,437
These bumps right here.

701
00:33:15,437 --> 00:33:17,522
Doctor, cheekbones and chin for me.

702
00:33:17,522 --> 00:33:20,359
Doc! My forehead is flat...

703
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:22,319
Could you fill it up?

704
00:33:22,902 --> 00:33:24,488
Let's begin.

705
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,833
<i>Since you consult too, it's
not moving fast enough.</i>

706
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:37,501
<i>Too many people waiting.</i>

707
00:33:37,501 --> 00:33:38,710
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

708
00:33:38,752 --> 00:33:40,212
<i>I gotta consult before surgery.</i>

709
00:33:40,212 --> 00:33:41,880
<i>I'll bring in experts.</i>

710
00:33:42,297 --> 00:33:43,047
What?

711
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,300
Doc, I'll do my best.

712
00:33:45,509 --> 00:33:47,344
How could she fill that role

713
00:33:47,344 --> 00:33:49,804
without any expertise and experience?

714
00:33:49,804 --> 00:33:51,223
No experience?

715
00:33:51,223 --> 00:33:52,807
Look at her face,
it's like a battlefield.

716
00:33:52,807 --> 00:33:54,268
She was knifed so many times.

717
00:33:54,268 --> 00:33:55,769
An endless war.

718
00:33:55,769 --> 00:33:56,895
Marketing Director Oh, good luck!

719
00:33:56,895 --> 00:33:58,104
Yes, Admin Director.

720
00:33:58,104 --> 00:34:00,524
Honey, let's work together.

721
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,027
They will take care of local

722
00:34:04,068 --> 00:34:06,821
and growing Chinese clients.

723
00:34:07,155 --> 00:34:08,698
Yoga instructor from Beijing!

724
00:34:08,698 --> 00:34:09,699
Deep breaths.

725
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:10,909
Tour guide from Shanghai!

726
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:11,576
Let's move together.

727
00:34:11,576 --> 00:34:13,703
- Lamb diner waitress from Ansan!
- Diner waitress?

728
00:34:13,703 --> 00:34:15,330
Proficiency in Chinese
is all that matters!

729
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:18,792
These gents will take over
the rising male clients.

730
00:34:18,792 --> 00:34:21,085
They were hot club MDs,

731
00:34:21,085 --> 00:34:22,337
so, they have vast connections.

732
00:34:22,337 --> 00:34:24,005
Mi-jung, then what should I do?

733
00:34:24,005 --> 00:34:27,133
Hyung-joon, continue being
friends with celebrities.

734
00:34:27,551 --> 00:34:28,092
Okay.

735
00:34:28,092 --> 00:34:30,679
So? How's it, honey?

736
00:34:33,307 --> 00:34:34,015
Ji-woo?

737
00:34:34,015 --> 00:34:35,225
That was very good!

738
00:34:35,225 --> 00:34:36,601
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

739
00:34:36,601 --> 00:34:38,187
Where you going?

740
00:34:40,772 --> 00:34:41,856
Dude, what's "MD"?

741
00:34:41,856 --> 00:34:43,483
MD?

742
00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:45,902
"Music Dance".

743
00:34:48,655 --> 00:34:49,948
I'm right.

744
00:34:51,157 --> 00:34:52,826
If you perk up the nose,

745
00:34:52,867 --> 00:34:55,329
the facial balance will be ruined,

746
00:34:55,745 --> 00:35:00,584
so, if you do breasts, nose
line gets 20% discount.

747
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:04,087
- If you do double-jaw.
- 30%.

748
00:35:04,296 --> 00:35:06,798
- If you pay cash in full...
- You get 15% discount!

749
00:35:06,798 --> 00:35:07,591
All done, all done.

750
00:35:07,591 --> 00:35:09,759
We can give you 15% discount.

751
00:35:09,759 --> 00:35:10,594
What do you think?

752
00:35:11,135 --> 00:35:12,512
Is that it? No way.

753
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:17,309
Additional 15% discount
whenever you refer a friend.

754
00:35:19,478 --> 00:35:20,812
$87?

755
00:35:20,812 --> 00:35:23,398
Too cheap, forgot 2 zeros.

756
00:35:23,773 --> 00:35:25,275
If you lack the funds,

757
00:35:25,275 --> 00:35:28,695
I can set you up with a
low interest tier 3 bank.

758
00:35:29,654 --> 00:35:32,407
I'm doing you a favor
because I care about you.

759
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,253
I'll call you after, okay.

760
00:35:44,753 --> 00:35:46,004
Who was it?

761
00:35:46,463 --> 00:35:48,047
Mi-jung.

762
00:35:50,509 --> 00:35:52,469
Why do I love sauna meals so much?

763
00:35:53,094 --> 00:35:54,471
It felt really bad earlier.

764
00:35:54,471 --> 00:35:56,640
I can't seem to fix
my relax esophagitis.

765
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,350
Reflux esophagitis.

766
00:35:58,475 --> 00:36:00,101
Can't you let these things slide?

767
00:36:00,101 --> 00:36:01,270
I'll end up a neutered.

768
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:03,104
- Neurotic.
- You punk...

769
00:36:03,938 --> 00:36:05,274
Hey, hey!

770
00:36:06,275 --> 00:36:07,817
They're Rice Girls!

771
00:36:07,942 --> 00:36:09,027
They're in ads already,

772
00:36:09,068 --> 00:36:10,612
they only debuted 3 months ago.

773
00:36:10,654 --> 00:36:12,906
No one can go into entertainment

774
00:36:12,906 --> 00:36:15,325
without getting worked on by you.

775
00:36:15,492 --> 00:36:17,411
We need to put that handsome face

776
00:36:17,452 --> 00:36:18,870
of yours on TV and ads.

777
00:36:19,663 --> 00:36:21,331
Thanks to you, our clinic will become

778
00:36:21,373 --> 00:36:22,499
an Apgujeong Land Rover.

779
00:36:22,624 --> 00:36:23,958
Landmark!

780
00:36:23,958 --> 00:36:26,503
If you're dumb, stop
trying to use those words!

781
00:36:26,503 --> 00:36:29,130
I'm off by only a little bit, man.

782
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:30,465
My neck hurts.

783
00:36:32,592 --> 00:36:35,679
Your muscles tighten
because you get worked up.

784
00:36:35,804 --> 00:36:36,513
No way.

785
00:36:36,513 --> 00:36:37,972
Allow me, come here.

786
00:36:37,972 --> 00:36:39,849
I'm good at this, come here.

787
00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:41,185
- Go easy.
- Okay.

788
00:36:43,102 --> 00:36:44,271
It hurts!

789
00:36:44,271 --> 00:36:46,356
I gotta put that much pressure!

790
00:36:46,356 --> 00:36:48,317
Who massages like that?
Come here, let me.

791
00:36:48,317 --> 00:36:49,025
You see?

792
00:36:49,025 --> 00:36:51,236
Gotta go easy, smooth, got it?

793
00:36:51,236 --> 00:36:52,321
Damn, wow...

794
00:36:52,321 --> 00:36:54,239
- Like this, here.
- Not bad.

795
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:55,324
- Feels good?
- Yeah...

796
00:36:55,324 --> 00:36:57,951
- This muscle in front too.
- Up here?

797
00:36:57,951 --> 00:37:00,245
- This will feel so good.
- That is insane!

798
00:37:00,245 --> 00:37:01,330
See? See?

799
00:37:04,416 --> 00:37:05,917
We were...

800
00:37:06,668 --> 00:37:09,671
It's not what you think.

801
00:37:09,671 --> 00:37:11,548
- Your drinks are ready.
- Good.

802
00:37:12,048 --> 00:37:14,133
We're going for lunch,
have a good meal.

803
00:37:14,133 --> 00:37:16,052
Have a great lunch!

804
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,346
So? Pretty easy, right?

805
00:37:17,471 --> 00:37:18,888
There isn't much to it.

806
00:37:18,972 --> 00:37:20,682
Maybe you could do the surgery too.

807
00:37:20,682 --> 00:37:22,684
I could probably do anesthetics.

808
00:37:24,018 --> 00:37:24,728
You sound like a psycho...

809
00:37:24,728 --> 00:37:26,104
Good afternoon.

810
00:37:26,438 --> 00:37:27,481
May I help you?

811
00:37:27,564 --> 00:37:29,566
We're from Gangnam Police.

812
00:37:29,774 --> 00:37:30,734
We've received a report

813
00:37:30,775 --> 00:37:32,277
of unlicensed medical malpractice.

814
00:37:32,902 --> 00:37:34,529
Park Ji-woo worked unlicensed

815
00:37:34,529 --> 00:37:36,823
at Jang Won-seok
Plastic Surgery, right?

816
00:37:37,532 --> 00:37:40,202
Dae-guk! What do we do?!

817
00:37:40,202 --> 00:37:41,703
Be quiet.

818
00:37:43,372 --> 00:37:45,790
Jang must've found out
that we worked Choi up

819
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:46,916
and tattled on us.

820
00:37:47,125 --> 00:37:48,210
Dammit...

821
00:37:48,377 --> 00:37:50,169
Don't mention it to Ji-woo.

822
00:37:50,504 --> 00:37:51,671
I already did.

823
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:54,090
I told him not to come
because cops are here.

824
00:37:54,299 --> 00:37:56,926
Why?! You couldn't stay...

825
00:37:58,262 --> 00:38:01,181
Why are your lips so loose?

826
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,807
Christ!

827
00:38:03,683 --> 00:38:05,435
Christ!

828
00:38:05,435 --> 00:38:07,812
Then that license was a forgery?!

829
00:38:07,812 --> 00:38:11,816
Listen, I heard these
cops are infamous thugs.

830
00:38:11,816 --> 00:38:14,444
They're trying to get a
leg up on us and rip us off.

831
00:38:14,444 --> 00:38:15,987
I'll take care of this.

832
00:38:15,987 --> 00:38:17,989
How can you take care of it?!

833
00:38:18,156 --> 00:38:20,700
You scammed me with a fake license!

834
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:25,079
I didn't scam you, I issued
a temporary license.

835
00:38:25,705 --> 00:38:27,541
Why are you issuing licenses?

836
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:29,334
How did you make a fake one?

837
00:38:29,334 --> 00:38:30,627
We got the real one from Choi,

838
00:38:30,627 --> 00:38:32,462
and opened this clinic,
isn't that enough?

839
00:38:32,462 --> 00:38:34,964
How is that enough? What about cops?

840
00:38:34,964 --> 00:38:37,175
Don't you dare lie to me and
sweep this under the rug!

841
00:38:37,175 --> 00:38:39,344
Come on...

842
00:38:39,469 --> 00:38:42,514
I can succeed only if you
do, why'd I lie to you?

843
00:38:42,514 --> 00:38:45,099
Look at my face, do I look
like someone who'd lie?

844
00:38:45,099 --> 00:38:48,102
- You should've told me...
- Right...

845
00:38:48,102 --> 00:38:49,729
- Dae-guk.
- What?

846
00:38:49,729 --> 00:38:50,522
It's Tae-cheon.

847
00:38:50,522 --> 00:38:52,982
You told him too?!

848
00:38:53,358 --> 00:38:54,234
- Christ!
- Christ!

849
00:38:54,234 --> 00:38:58,238
Cops aren't the problem,
Chairman Wong is!

850
00:38:58,697 --> 00:39:00,782
He's a former police chief,

851
00:39:00,782 --> 00:39:02,659
so he drops out at
first sign of trouble

852
00:39:02,659 --> 00:39:03,993
with his foreign investment!

853
00:39:03,993 --> 00:39:07,914
Our clinic and that 15-floor
hospital idea are done!

854
00:39:11,042 --> 00:39:13,420
You talked to Big Dick
about our hospital idea?

855
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,129
Is that important right now?

856
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,965
You're a funny thug.

857
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:18,800
Of course it is, what did he say?

858
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,593
Forget it!

859
00:39:19,593 --> 00:39:21,928
Pay those pigs off like they wanted.

860
00:39:21,928 --> 00:39:24,723
If you start paying off
cops, it'll turn into a habit!

861
00:39:24,723 --> 00:39:27,476
Then what? Get my boys to work on them?

862
00:39:27,517 --> 00:39:29,603
Work on them? Are you a gangster?

863
00:39:29,603 --> 00:39:30,729
Right, you are.

864
00:39:30,729 --> 00:39:33,898
Guys like him must be
crushed by their bosses.

865
00:39:33,898 --> 00:39:35,525
Don't even have connections?

866
00:39:35,525 --> 00:39:39,988
Man, I know someone in
Major Crimes, Chief Choi.

867
00:39:40,489 --> 00:39:44,117
We're like blood brothers,
I'll sort this out.

868
00:39:45,076 --> 00:39:47,537
Ji-woo, don't worry,
I'll take care of it.

869
00:39:49,331 --> 00:39:51,333
Hello, uh, wait...

870
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:52,667
The number doesn...

871
00:39:53,502 --> 00:39:55,670
The line's busy, he's on the phone...

872
00:39:55,795 --> 00:39:57,171
I have one.

873
00:39:58,047 --> 00:39:59,591
I got a connection.

874
00:40:01,385 --> 00:40:03,887
It's Korea's first locally
developed filler.

875
00:40:04,178 --> 00:40:06,055
If you want to use my connection,

876
00:40:06,055 --> 00:40:08,016
I gotta have something in return.

877
00:40:08,808 --> 00:40:11,102
What's the cost of this?

878
00:40:11,228 --> 00:40:12,271
$6.

879
00:40:12,729 --> 00:40:14,814
The ones on the market now
is US-made and costs $170.

880
00:40:14,814 --> 00:40:17,401
Wait, $6 and $170?!

881
00:40:17,401 --> 00:40:20,404
Hold on, six times two is
twelve, six times three is...

882
00:40:20,404 --> 00:40:22,281
How many folds is this?

883
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:23,240
Huh?

884
00:40:24,324 --> 00:40:24,699
What?

885
00:40:24,699 --> 00:40:27,744
If you swap this for the
expensive German-made,

886
00:40:27,869 --> 00:40:31,498
cost rises to $500,
and clients pay $1,200.

887
00:40:32,374 --> 00:40:35,210
Whoa, $1,200? Goddamn thieves...

888
00:40:35,419 --> 00:40:36,295
I'm sorry.

889
00:40:36,795 --> 00:40:39,423
Then why aren't people using this?

890
00:40:39,631 --> 00:40:41,258
Hasn't been approved by FDA.

891
00:40:41,425 --> 00:40:42,842
It's awaiting approval.

892
00:40:42,967 --> 00:40:44,428
But the effectiveness is certain.

893
00:40:44,636 --> 00:40:46,305
No side effects thus far.

894
00:40:46,513 --> 00:40:49,516
Then what's your condition?

895
00:40:49,516 --> 00:40:52,727
I'll supply, you sell,
we split the profit 50-50.

896
00:40:52,727 --> 00:40:53,853
50-50...

897
00:40:53,853 --> 00:40:58,149
Then I'll setup the connection
as a bonus of our deal.

898
00:41:00,068 --> 00:41:02,070
I've done so many
terrible things in my life

899
00:41:02,111 --> 00:41:02,946
while living here,

900
00:41:02,946 --> 00:41:04,989
but that filler is...

901
00:41:04,989 --> 00:41:06,491
Yeah, it's dangerous.

902
00:41:06,491 --> 00:41:07,867
It really is.

903
00:41:07,951 --> 00:41:09,118
But there's no other way,

904
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,579
what can we do about the pigs?

905
00:41:10,579 --> 00:41:13,081
You still can't reach
your detective friend?

906
00:41:14,208 --> 00:41:15,667
His line is still busy.

907
00:41:17,919 --> 00:41:19,128
What to do...

908
00:41:19,838 --> 00:41:21,130
Don't do it?

909
00:41:21,465 --> 00:41:23,049
No, Ji-woo.

910
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,428
One must earn like a dog
and spend like a beast.

911
00:41:26,553 --> 00:41:27,679
So, we should?

912
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:31,558
Coin flip.

913
00:41:31,641 --> 00:41:34,894
Heads, we do it, tails, we don't, okay?

914
00:41:38,482 --> 00:41:39,649
- Bro.
- Yeah?

915
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,860
Let's just do it.

916
00:41:49,659 --> 00:41:51,035
I'm glad to proceed with our deal.

917
00:41:51,035 --> 00:41:53,788
So, shall we talk about
the bonus we discussed?

918
00:41:53,997 --> 00:41:55,582
Who should I introduce you?

919
00:41:55,582 --> 00:41:57,251
Police commissioner's wife?

920
00:41:58,793 --> 00:41:59,961
Or his lover?

921
00:42:00,086 --> 00:42:00,837
Wife would be...

922
00:42:00,837 --> 00:42:03,047
No way, his lover.

923
00:42:03,632 --> 00:42:05,759
Married couples don't talk.

924
00:42:07,677 --> 00:42:12,891
Please ask him to have
these officers off our backs.

925
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:15,894
Very well.

926
00:42:16,728 --> 00:42:19,314
I'll talk to the commissioner.

927
00:42:19,648 --> 00:42:20,899
No, to his lover...

928
00:42:22,484 --> 00:42:25,445
Yes, I'll talk to him.

929
00:42:28,448 --> 00:42:29,699
Oh...

930
00:43:32,762 --> 00:43:33,638
<i>Kang Dae-guk</i>

931
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,514
I've confirmed your deposit,

932
00:43:34,723 --> 00:43:37,642
make sure to send the
remainder on this date.

933
00:43:37,767 --> 00:43:40,687
All right, it's just pocket change.

934
00:43:41,438 --> 00:43:42,856
All done?

935
00:43:43,315 --> 00:43:45,567
It's our home now.

936
00:43:46,526 --> 00:43:47,777
Here's the money.

937
00:43:50,614 --> 00:43:52,907
You don't dye your hair anymore?

938
00:43:52,907 --> 00:43:55,952
Gotta keep my hair tidy
when I do business.

939
00:43:55,952 --> 00:43:57,996
Yup, gotta keep it tidy.

940
00:43:59,163 --> 00:44:01,833
A 15-floor one-stop shop...

941
00:44:01,833 --> 00:44:02,626
<i>One-stop Plastic Surgery Center</i>

942
00:44:02,709 --> 00:44:04,544
It's not totally impossible...

943
00:44:05,545 --> 00:44:07,839
We're golden once medical laws reform

944
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:09,424
and restrictions ease up.

945
00:44:09,424 --> 00:44:11,009
Think that'll happen?

946
00:44:11,009 --> 00:44:14,012
It's me you're talking to.

947
00:44:14,721 --> 00:44:16,515
Anyway, when will you do my nose?

948
00:44:16,515 --> 00:44:19,351
Don't do it, what's the
point on that mug?

949
00:44:19,351 --> 00:44:20,644
"That mug"?

950
00:44:20,644 --> 00:44:21,895
What's wrong with this?

951
00:44:21,895 --> 00:44:25,148
My nose got crushed for
boxing early in my days.

952
00:44:25,357 --> 00:44:27,401
I wanted to learn piano instead,

953
00:44:27,609 --> 00:44:29,986
my parents forced boxing
on me, ruining my looks.

954
00:44:29,986 --> 00:44:30,987
Bro.

955
00:44:31,405 --> 00:44:33,782
Your nose isn't the
only thing, look at me.

956
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:38,495
Here, sharp nose like this.

957
00:44:40,121 --> 00:44:41,956
Appearance isn't everything.

958
00:44:46,545 --> 00:44:47,421
What the hell?

959
00:44:47,421 --> 00:44:48,380
Hello?

960
00:44:51,675 --> 00:44:53,677
Could you do my cuticles as well?

961
00:44:53,677 --> 00:44:55,762
What? Who is it?

962
00:45:01,643 --> 00:45:05,189
The tenant under me is going
nuts over the water leak.

963
00:45:05,564 --> 00:45:10,944
How could an apartment in
Apgujeong leak so badly?

964
00:45:12,321 --> 00:45:14,573
Come check it out yourself then!

965
00:45:14,739 --> 00:45:16,241
How many times has it been?

966
00:45:16,658 --> 00:45:18,285
No, I can't set up a time,

967
00:45:18,327 --> 00:45:20,119
I'll tell you my passcode...

968
00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:21,288
Hey, hand it over.

969
00:45:21,288 --> 00:45:22,456
What?

970
00:45:24,208 --> 00:45:26,293
Don't be too harsh, I'm behind on rent.

971
00:45:28,002 --> 00:45:29,796
Yes, hello?

972
00:45:29,796 --> 00:45:32,048
I'm attorney-at-law Kang Dae-guk,

973
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:34,509
a legal representative of Mr. Park.

974
00:45:34,509 --> 00:45:36,261
Yes, I'm a lawyer.

975
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:37,554
What for?

976
00:45:37,804 --> 00:45:40,349
Not loyer, a lawyer.

977
00:45:40,765 --> 00:45:45,019
Under the Housing Lease Protection Act,

978
00:45:45,312 --> 00:45:47,564
the landlord must pay in full.

979
00:45:47,689 --> 00:45:52,194
Breaking this Act
results in $20,000 fine

980
00:45:52,194 --> 00:45:54,696
and 2 years in prison.

981
00:45:54,696 --> 00:45:57,282
Please take care of it immediately.

982
00:45:57,282 --> 00:45:58,742
Thank you.

983
00:45:58,908 --> 00:45:59,993
What are you talking about?

984
00:46:00,118 --> 00:46:02,412
That's how they understand.

985
00:46:03,663 --> 00:46:09,419
You make a ton of money,
move to a better place.

986
00:46:09,586 --> 00:46:13,089
I want to, but like I said,
I got a debt to pay back.

987
00:46:13,089 --> 00:46:14,591
Hey, Tae-cheon.

988
00:46:14,799 --> 00:46:18,177
Yeah, okay, I understand.

989
00:46:18,177 --> 00:46:19,888
I'm gonna hang up!

990
00:46:21,431 --> 00:46:22,266
Come with me.

991
00:46:22,266 --> 00:46:23,642
Why?

992
00:46:23,933 --> 00:46:26,060
Here, open it.

993
00:46:32,692 --> 00:46:33,485
What's this money?

994
00:46:33,485 --> 00:46:35,111
It's the company money.

995
00:46:35,111 --> 00:46:37,322
I'm lending it to you, so move at once.

996
00:46:38,072 --> 00:46:39,324
Man...

997
00:46:39,408 --> 00:46:42,244
You're lending it to me?
It won't impact you?

998
00:46:42,494 --> 00:46:45,247
It's Big Dick's money, so
it must be paid back soon,

999
00:46:45,497 --> 00:46:47,291
but you don't need to worry at all.

1000
00:46:47,499 --> 00:46:49,751
Because you're the director

1001
00:46:49,751 --> 00:46:52,921
of a 15-floor plastic surgery center.

1002
00:46:53,672 --> 00:46:55,215
Know what I mean?

1003
00:46:57,634 --> 00:47:01,095
That call earlier, did
Big Dick approve it?

1004
00:47:05,684 --> 00:47:07,311
Very good!

1005
00:47:08,019 --> 00:47:09,062
Good!

1006
00:47:28,373 --> 00:47:29,749
Oh my, here you are!

1007
00:47:29,749 --> 00:47:31,084
Good evening.

1008
00:47:31,084 --> 00:47:32,752
It's been so long.

1009
00:47:34,003 --> 00:47:35,129
Good work.

1010
00:47:37,006 --> 00:47:38,758
This is Chairman Wong from China.

1011
00:47:39,343 --> 00:47:40,134
Big Dick!

1012
00:47:40,134 --> 00:47:41,511
Ms. Lee from Gangnam District Office.

1013
00:47:41,511 --> 00:47:42,346
You are stunning.

1014
00:47:42,346 --> 00:47:45,390
All that work to make
Tae-cheon look good?

1015
00:47:45,682 --> 00:47:47,351
We all worked so hard for you,

1016
00:47:47,392 --> 00:47:49,228
but he's the one who'll benefit.

1017
00:47:49,269 --> 00:47:50,937
And why is the center named JTC?

1018
00:47:50,979 --> 00:47:52,897
Isn't that Jo Tae-cheon's initials?

1019
00:47:52,981 --> 00:47:54,774
It's not like the building is his.

1020
00:47:54,941 --> 00:47:56,776
Gangsters sure are dumb.

1021
00:47:56,985 --> 00:47:59,279
Thank you so much for the investment.

1022
00:47:59,654 --> 00:48:01,448
Here, here.

1023
00:48:02,156 --> 00:48:04,951
Ji-woo, come with me.

1024
00:48:11,124 --> 00:48:14,085
Cheers, drink, drink!

1025
00:48:14,085 --> 00:48:15,379
Cheers!

1026
00:48:15,379 --> 00:48:18,548
Good evening, Big... I
mean, Chairman Wong.

1027
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:22,886
Let's greet him, nice to meet you, sir.

1028
00:48:25,805 --> 00:48:30,059
Well, this is the
director of our clinic,

1029
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,687
and he's the administrator,

1030
00:48:32,729 --> 00:48:35,607
he does all the miscellaneous stuff.

1031
00:48:35,607 --> 00:48:36,691
Miscellaneous?

1032
00:48:39,194 --> 00:48:40,487
Great work everyone.

1033
00:48:40,612 --> 00:48:43,657
I hope you continue the good work.

1034
00:48:43,657 --> 00:48:44,908
Thank you so much.

1035
00:48:44,908 --> 00:48:46,576
You've done great work.

1036
00:48:46,576 --> 00:48:48,578
He wishes you continue doing good work.

1037
00:48:50,414 --> 00:48:51,790
Chairman!

1038
00:48:59,673 --> 00:49:01,258
Oasis.

1039
00:49:02,175 --> 00:49:03,385
Oasis?

1040
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:05,804
What's that? What's he doing?

1041
00:49:05,929 --> 00:49:07,055
Shush!

1042
00:49:07,306 --> 00:49:09,474
I believe that our building

1043
00:49:09,516 --> 00:49:12,561
should be called Oasis, not JTC, sir.

1044
00:49:12,561 --> 00:49:13,728
Our admin must be hungry.

1045
00:49:13,728 --> 00:49:15,439
Shut up, shush.

1046
00:49:16,898 --> 00:49:19,859
Your name, Wong Jin-su!

1047
00:49:19,984 --> 00:49:22,279
It means oasis in a hot desert.

1048
00:49:23,071 --> 00:49:25,490
I believe that our building

1049
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:28,243
must be named after your name.

1050
00:49:28,243 --> 00:49:29,828
What do you think, Dr. Park?

1051
00:49:29,828 --> 00:49:31,580
- I too believe this.
- That's right.

1052
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:34,624
I think that our clinic
should be like an oasis,

1053
00:49:34,624 --> 00:49:37,043
giving people hope
through plastic surgery.

1054
00:49:37,627 --> 00:49:39,421
Yes, that's right.

1055
00:49:44,426 --> 00:49:47,387
You gents are witty.

1056
00:49:47,887 --> 00:49:49,764
He says you two are witty.

1057
00:49:50,014 --> 00:49:51,433
Thank you.

1058
00:49:52,976 --> 00:49:53,977
Chairman.

1059
00:49:54,186 --> 00:49:55,729
I'm actually...

1060
00:49:58,815 --> 00:50:00,359
Chinese.

1061
00:50:00,734 --> 00:50:02,527
What the hell are you saying?

1062
00:50:03,069 --> 00:50:04,321
What did you say?

1063
00:50:04,321 --> 00:50:05,447
Shush!

1064
00:50:05,614 --> 00:50:07,991
I had reasons to keep
my birthright a secret.

1065
00:50:07,991 --> 00:50:10,702
Dude, you were born in Apgujeong!

1066
00:50:10,702 --> 00:50:12,787
I was born in Tsingtao.

1067
00:50:13,955 --> 00:50:16,958
I grew up in Korea, so
I can't speak Chinese.

1068
00:50:16,958 --> 00:50:18,627
Even though I don't speak it,

1069
00:50:18,627 --> 00:50:21,380
I'm Chinese with Chinese blood in me!

1070
00:50:22,547 --> 00:50:24,466
Please take me in, I'll do my best!

1071
00:50:24,466 --> 00:50:25,592
I want to be successful!

1072
00:50:25,592 --> 00:50:27,427
Master!

1073
00:50:28,303 --> 00:50:29,513
Where is the washroom?

1074
00:50:31,306 --> 00:50:32,140
Did I say that right?

1075
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:33,308
What did you say?

1076
00:50:33,975 --> 00:50:36,728
- That's gotta be a good sign.
- No way.

1077
00:50:36,728 --> 00:50:38,062
Little brother,

1078
00:50:38,104 --> 00:50:41,816
your appearance instills
zero confidence,

1079
00:50:41,816 --> 00:50:44,361
but I like your style.

1080
00:50:45,737 --> 00:50:49,991
He says you are fun, and likes you.

1081
00:50:50,116 --> 00:50:51,117
Master! Thank you!

1082
00:50:51,117 --> 00:50:52,577
He's hilarious. He's from Tsingtao!

1083
00:50:52,577 --> 00:50:53,745
I farted!

1084
00:50:53,745 --> 00:50:54,663
Thank you!

1085
00:50:54,663 --> 00:50:55,955
I'm from Tsingtao too!

1086
00:50:55,955 --> 00:50:58,708
Thank you!

1087
00:50:58,708 --> 00:51:00,710
Tsingtao!

1088
00:51:14,224 --> 00:51:16,643
â™ª It's time, time to find me â™ª

1089
00:51:16,643 --> 00:51:19,062
â™ª Looking forward to another me â™ª

1090
00:51:19,229 --> 00:51:23,107
â™ª Time to find another me â™ª

1091
00:51:23,107 --> 00:51:26,236
â™ª who's inside me â™ª

1092
00:51:26,361 --> 00:51:31,200
â™ª I'll love me, let me try, â™ª
â™ª give me confidence â™ª

1093
00:51:31,366 --> 00:51:34,494
â™ª The most beautiful â™ª
â™ª thing in the world â™ª

1094
00:51:34,494 --> 00:51:36,205
â™ª I have to find me â™ª

1095
00:51:44,463 --> 00:51:46,590
â™ª Change me like magic â™ª

1096
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:48,925
â™ª Like water in the desert â™ª

1097
00:51:49,133 --> 00:51:53,805
â™ª Someone said once, from head to toe, â™ª

1098
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:56,558
â™ª my head, my face, my skin, â™ª

1099
00:51:56,558 --> 00:52:00,187
â™ª down to my fingernails â™ª

1100
00:52:00,395 --> 00:52:01,938
â™ª If there's a beautiful glow, â™ª

1101
00:52:02,272 --> 00:52:04,441
â™ª that's the end of the journey â™ª

1102
00:52:05,108 --> 00:52:07,026
â™ª That's Oasis â™ª

1103
00:52:07,194 --> 00:52:09,654
â™ª It will make me beautiful â™ª

1104
00:52:10,113 --> 00:52:14,743
â™ª Run to it, let me find me â™ª

1105
00:52:14,743 --> 00:52:17,120
â™ª Oasis, Oasis, â™ª

1106
00:52:17,329 --> 00:52:19,498
â™ª let's run to Oasis â™ª

1107
00:52:19,498 --> 00:52:20,707
â™ª Oasis will boost your confidence â™ª

1108
00:52:20,707 --> 00:52:23,084
â™ª Where I'll be reinvented â™ª

1109
00:52:28,131 --> 00:52:29,924
Come in! Please come in!

1110
00:52:29,924 --> 00:52:31,843
Trust me! Trust us!

1111
00:52:31,843 --> 00:52:33,470
Let's go!

1112
00:52:33,637 --> 00:52:34,929
Go!

1113
00:52:35,096 --> 00:52:37,015
<i>Ji-woo, this is the real beginning.</i>

1114
00:52:37,182 --> 00:52:39,142
<i>I'll make you a star doctor.</i>

1115
00:52:39,226 --> 00:52:40,727
<i>What are you saying now?</i>

1116
00:52:40,894 --> 00:52:44,314
You know that show that
I was on? 'Love House'.

1117
00:52:44,314 --> 00:52:45,315
The show that fixes houses?

1118
00:52:45,357 --> 00:52:46,483
Yeah, she's the producer.

1119
00:52:46,566 --> 00:52:47,276
Is that right?

1120
00:52:47,276 --> 00:52:48,109
Yes.

1121
00:52:48,109 --> 00:52:50,153
Why did you want the intro?

1122
00:52:51,029 --> 00:52:52,697
Fixes houses?

1123
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,076
Instead of fixing houses,

1124
00:52:57,619 --> 00:53:00,205
what about fixing faces?

1125
00:53:00,497 --> 00:53:03,500
How could you show that on TV?

1126
00:53:03,958 --> 00:53:05,294
Faces?

1127
00:53:05,544 --> 00:53:07,504
The title will be...

1128
00:53:09,464 --> 00:53:11,174
'Love Face'.

1129
00:53:14,469 --> 00:53:17,264
A makeover show that changes your life,

1130
00:53:17,306 --> 00:53:18,640
this is Love Face!

1131
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,725
Welcome to our first episode,

1132
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,644
hello, I'm Kim Kyung-ran.

1133
00:53:25,314 --> 00:53:26,898
<i>Park Min-ju / 25</i>

1134
00:53:26,898 --> 00:53:28,942
<i>Having lost her confidence,</i>

1135
00:53:28,942 --> 00:53:30,777
<i>she was afraid of people's stares,</i>

1136
00:53:30,777 --> 00:53:33,863
<i>and could not come out of hiding</i>

1137
00:53:33,863 --> 00:53:38,868
<i>We will give her hope</i>

1138
00:53:39,453 --> 00:53:42,581
Min-ju, think of only good things.

1139
00:53:48,212 --> 00:53:51,381
It's time to face a miracle.

1140
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:56,928
Reinvented by Love Face,
please welcome Park Min-ju!

1141
00:54:00,974 --> 00:54:02,892
I can't see her.

1142
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:18,157
What miracle is waiting for her?

1143
00:54:18,157 --> 00:54:19,117
Excuse me, turn on the lights.

1144
00:54:19,117 --> 00:54:20,577
Be quiet, shut up.

1145
00:54:20,577 --> 00:54:23,872
Let's welcome her to the world.

1146
00:54:23,955 --> 00:54:25,415
Min-ju?

1147
00:54:38,011 --> 00:54:40,514
So beautiful, she's so beautiful!

1148
00:54:41,431 --> 00:54:42,599
Watch it...

1149
00:54:44,684 --> 00:54:46,311
Park Ji-woo!

1150
00:54:51,525 --> 00:54:53,193
<i>Style TV "Love Face's Real Star"
Dr. Park Ji-woo</i>

1151
00:55:01,368 --> 00:55:04,454
Very good, that's it,
look this way slightly.

1152
00:55:04,746 --> 00:55:06,998
Stare into the camera with tense eyes.

1153
00:55:07,541 --> 00:55:09,501
To your left.

1154
00:55:09,709 --> 00:55:12,086
Very good, smile a little.

1155
00:55:12,754 --> 00:55:15,173
I think that's enough.

1156
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:17,175
Ji-woo might get tired.

1157
00:55:17,301 --> 00:55:20,429
Seeing you at the photoshoot,
you could be a model.

1158
00:55:20,429 --> 00:55:22,889
Should I?

1159
00:55:23,515 --> 00:55:25,559
Lastly, are you thankful for anyone

1160
00:55:25,559 --> 00:55:28,812
who supported and believed
in you to reach this far?

1161
00:55:29,229 --> 00:55:30,980
Thankful?

1162
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:40,156
I'm thankful to myself
for believing in me.

1163
00:55:44,453 --> 00:55:46,788
- That's funny?
- Not funny.

1164
00:55:46,788 --> 00:55:48,373
Good work.

1165
00:55:49,374 --> 00:55:52,711
How do you thank yourself?

1166
00:55:52,711 --> 00:55:53,837
In front of the mirror?

1167
00:55:54,379 --> 00:55:55,755
Come on.

1168
00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:58,174
You did everything.

1169
00:55:58,174 --> 00:56:00,009
I'm thankful to you too.

1170
00:56:00,009 --> 00:56:00,552
Sure.

1171
00:56:00,552 --> 00:56:02,971
I doubt it, I didn't do shit.

1172
00:56:02,971 --> 00:56:04,973
What's my TV schedule?

1173
00:56:06,099 --> 00:56:08,643
Dae-guk told me to cancel them

1174
00:56:08,685 --> 00:56:10,979
because of your surgeries.

1175
00:56:11,563 --> 00:56:13,398
How could you cancel them
without consulting me?

1176
00:56:13,523 --> 00:56:15,817
Why do I need to report
every little detail to you?

1177
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:17,527
Shouldn't I know them too?

1178
00:56:17,777 --> 00:56:19,488
I'm the one in charge,
I'll take care of it.

1179
00:56:19,571 --> 00:56:21,698
Mind your own business
and focus on your work.

1180
00:56:21,906 --> 00:56:24,117
I'm drawing a big picture, got that?

1181
00:56:25,452 --> 00:56:27,246
He did everything, listen to that guy.

1182
00:56:28,538 --> 00:56:30,249
You did good today.

1183
00:56:30,249 --> 00:56:31,040
Great!

1184
00:56:40,759 --> 00:56:43,720
Please take a look around.

1185
00:56:44,513 --> 00:56:46,014
Isn't this a parking lot?

1186
00:56:46,181 --> 00:56:48,725
What would you say if
your building rose up

1187
00:56:49,017 --> 00:56:51,853
in Apgujeong's most expensive land?

1188
00:56:51,853 --> 00:56:53,188
<i>K-wave Beauty Town</i>

1189
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,981
This is a business proposal

1190
00:56:55,023 --> 00:56:56,775
that I'm working with Gangnam.

1191
00:56:56,941 --> 00:56:59,110
<i>The district chief is my
high school senior,</i>

1192
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:01,363
<i>so he's helping me push
this business forward.</i>

1193
00:57:01,363 --> 00:57:03,532
Wow, when did you learn to do that?

1194
00:57:03,573 --> 00:57:05,950
Taking advantage of the Korean Wave

1195
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:08,578
by using the title
'K-wave Beauty Town',

1196
00:57:08,787 --> 00:57:10,539
it will align with the business

1197
00:57:10,539 --> 00:57:12,332
that the government is pushing.

1198
00:57:12,332 --> 00:57:14,083
How do you like it?

1199
00:57:17,212 --> 00:57:18,672
Dae-guk, a drink...

1200
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:41,611
What's this?

1201
00:57:43,112 --> 00:57:44,531
He says it's a wonderful proposal.

1202
00:57:44,656 --> 00:57:45,782
Thank you so much.

1203
00:57:45,782 --> 00:57:49,494
I won't ever disappoint you, Big Dick!

1204
00:57:49,494 --> 00:57:51,496
I mean, Chairman Wong.

1205
00:57:52,914 --> 00:57:54,416
He won't disappoint you.

1206
00:57:54,416 --> 00:57:55,917
Thank you, thank you.

1207
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:57,836
One more thing.

1208
00:57:57,836 --> 00:57:59,254
There's one more thing.

1209
00:57:59,254 --> 00:58:03,883
My son-in-law is about to
graduate from Johns Hopkins,

1210
00:58:04,384 --> 00:58:08,263
I think he wants to
get into plastic surgery.

1211
00:58:08,263 --> 00:58:11,600
His son-in-law is about to
graduate from Johns Hopkins,

1212
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:14,394
he wants to get into plastic surgery.

1213
00:58:14,394 --> 00:58:18,357
Ah, your son-in-law is from Johns?

1214
00:58:18,357 --> 00:58:22,569
He wants to work in Korea...

1215
00:58:22,569 --> 00:58:25,280
He wants to work in Korea.

1216
00:58:27,324 --> 00:58:29,701
I see, I gotta babysit
his son-in-law too?

1217
00:58:30,369 --> 00:58:34,664
It'd be our honor to work
with such a great man.

1218
00:58:34,664 --> 00:58:38,335
He would be honored to work with him.

1219
00:58:39,211 --> 00:58:43,673
But what about Dr. Park...

1220
00:58:45,217 --> 00:58:47,511
Dr. Park?

1221
00:58:59,606 --> 00:59:00,857
Holy shit!

1222
00:59:02,942 --> 00:59:05,279
You had a night surgery?

1223
00:59:05,279 --> 00:59:07,822
What did you eat? Where have you been?

1224
00:59:07,822 --> 00:59:10,116
Big Dick nagged me to come out.

1225
00:59:10,116 --> 00:59:11,701
For that big picture?

1226
00:59:12,369 --> 00:59:15,247
Well, not exactly.

1227
00:59:15,789 --> 00:59:18,583
He drinks distilled hard
liquor in a beer mug,

1228
00:59:18,583 --> 00:59:21,044
I thought I was a goner.

1229
00:59:24,298 --> 00:59:26,090
You're not hiding
anything from me, right?

1230
00:59:26,716 --> 00:59:29,928
Of course not, do you even need to ask?

1231
00:59:33,014 --> 00:59:36,685
Big Dick apparently has a son-in-law.

1232
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:37,977
So?

1233
00:59:42,649 --> 00:59:45,109
And you are hiding anything from me?

1234
00:59:46,069 --> 00:59:47,654
Can you not come here drunk?

1235
00:59:47,696 --> 00:59:49,531
Some people work all night here.

1236
00:59:49,531 --> 00:59:50,907
Dude, when you talk to me,

1237
00:59:50,907 --> 00:59:54,869
do you really need
to frown and be cold?

1238
00:59:55,287 --> 00:59:56,830
Mr. Kang.

1239
00:59:56,830 --> 01:00:00,041
When talking to me at the
clinic, call me Dr. Park.

1240
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:03,837
If there are any new updates,

1241
01:00:03,878 --> 01:00:05,589
report to me immediately.

1242
01:00:25,024 --> 01:00:27,611
I'm sure you've heard it from Ms. Hong,

1243
01:00:27,986 --> 01:00:30,697
but we are a very private clinic

1244
01:00:30,739 --> 01:00:33,116
that only deals with VVIPs.

1245
01:00:35,369 --> 01:00:37,954
You'll get plenty of free time.

1246
01:00:37,954 --> 01:00:39,748
And a lot higher salary.

1247
01:00:39,748 --> 01:00:41,833
But I'll still be on a salary.

1248
01:00:42,251 --> 01:00:44,211
I don't really do well

1249
01:00:44,211 --> 01:00:47,256
working for salary under someone.

1250
01:00:48,423 --> 01:00:50,925
- Is that so?
- Yes, it is so.

1251
01:00:52,761 --> 01:00:56,765
I heard you're not actually the owner

1252
01:00:56,806 --> 01:00:59,434
of your current clinic.

1253
01:01:00,143 --> 01:01:02,354
His name is Kang...

1254
01:01:02,354 --> 01:01:05,440
- Kang Dae-guk?
- Yes, Kang Dae-guk.

1255
01:01:05,815 --> 01:01:08,693
Aren't you working under
him and get paid a salary?

1256
01:01:08,693 --> 01:01:11,613
He's an administrator, and
I'm the director of Oasis.

1257
01:01:11,613 --> 01:01:13,198
I run the clinic.

1258
01:01:13,198 --> 01:01:14,283
And do clients come to us

1259
01:01:14,324 --> 01:01:15,659
because of the administrator?

1260
01:01:15,909 --> 01:01:19,246
They come because of
my name, Park Ji-woo.

1261
01:01:19,579 --> 01:01:20,205
Dr. Park.

1262
01:01:20,205 --> 01:01:22,707
Yes, that's my name!

1263
01:01:25,835 --> 01:01:27,337
I have a surgery coming up.

1264
01:01:32,884 --> 01:01:37,472
He's got vigor, and
is so full of himself.

1265
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:45,939
Dr. Park, oh my.

1266
01:01:46,815 --> 01:01:48,024
What brings you here?

1267
01:01:48,024 --> 01:01:52,987
I was passing by, I
thought I'd drop by.

1268
01:01:53,447 --> 01:01:57,075
I wanted to see you.

1269
01:01:57,201 --> 01:02:01,788
It's nice to be just two of us.

1270
01:02:02,372 --> 01:02:04,958
- Dae-guk isn't here...
- Why are you here?

1271
01:02:10,547 --> 01:02:11,548
Gosh...

1272
01:02:32,652 --> 01:02:34,696
What's so urgent?

1273
01:02:36,698 --> 01:02:38,450
What are you doing, asshole?

1274
01:02:39,534 --> 01:02:41,160
What's that?

1275
01:02:42,454 --> 01:02:43,955
Shit, did Tae-cheon tell you?

1276
01:02:43,955 --> 01:02:45,540
Is that important?

1277
01:02:46,165 --> 01:02:47,834
He's trying to divide us

1278
01:02:47,834 --> 01:02:49,961
by using this, can't you tell?

1279
01:02:49,961 --> 01:02:50,837
We're already divided,

1280
01:02:50,837 --> 01:02:52,171
perhaps you were so clueless

1281
01:02:52,171 --> 01:02:53,632
while getting drunk with Wong.

1282
01:02:53,632 --> 01:02:55,091
Why do you talk like that?

1283
01:02:55,091 --> 01:02:57,010
I'd tell you when it's all set up.

1284
01:02:57,010 --> 01:02:57,761
Set up?

1285
01:02:57,761 --> 01:02:59,638
Wong's son-in-law is the set up?!

1286
01:03:02,266 --> 01:03:04,226
Oh that... listen...

1287
01:03:04,226 --> 01:03:05,644
This is what you meant
by collaboration,

1288
01:03:05,644 --> 01:03:06,895
backstabbing?

1289
01:03:06,895 --> 01:03:08,188
- Are you drunk?
- Why?

1290
01:03:08,188 --> 01:03:09,898
Changed your mind now?

1291
01:03:09,898 --> 01:03:12,817
That's the nature of hooligans,
I know that so well!

1292
01:03:12,817 --> 01:03:15,153
Hooligans? Do you want a beating?

1293
01:03:15,153 --> 01:03:17,155
Do I look easy? Is that it?

1294
01:03:17,155 --> 01:03:19,658
I did sports until middle
school, asshole!

1295
01:03:26,623 --> 01:03:28,375
Goddammit!

1296
01:03:30,168 --> 01:03:32,003
Shit...

1297
01:03:42,181 --> 01:03:44,057
Which sport?

1298
01:03:47,936 --> 01:03:49,145
Table tennis.

1299
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,319
Wong wanted to cut you off,

1300
01:03:55,319 --> 01:03:56,945
but I got on my knees and begged,

1301
01:03:56,986 --> 01:03:58,572
and kept you on as co-director.

1302
01:03:59,113 --> 01:04:00,782
You took it all wrong.

1303
01:04:01,074 --> 01:04:02,784
You've changed, you know that?

1304
01:04:02,784 --> 01:04:04,953
You've lost your initial goal.

1305
01:04:08,039 --> 01:04:10,334
The best medical center will be built

1306
01:04:10,334 --> 01:04:12,586
in Apgujeong, the heart of Gangnam.

1307
01:04:12,711 --> 01:04:15,380
As you can see, 2
floors of parking lot,

1308
01:04:15,589 --> 01:04:17,341
the 2nd and 3rd floors for K-wave shop,

1309
01:04:17,341 --> 01:04:18,883
and the 4th and 5th for a theater,

1310
01:04:18,883 --> 01:04:20,802
and 6th through 18th will
be total plastic surgery...

1311
01:04:20,802 --> 01:04:25,390
Wong's son-in-law is coming next month.

1312
01:04:26,266 --> 01:04:30,562
Do you know what Dae-guk
said when cutting of Dr. Jang?

1313
01:04:31,730 --> 01:04:37,236
"When a shop gets an upgrade,
the owner should too."

1314
01:04:37,486 --> 01:04:40,864
It will be the greatest
medical resort in history.

1315
01:04:41,198 --> 01:04:44,075
That's incredible!

1316
01:05:08,933 --> 01:05:10,143
- Good morning.
- Hey, hey.

1317
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:11,686
Good morning.

1318
01:05:14,231 --> 01:05:15,899
Hey there.

1319
01:05:17,234 --> 01:05:20,195
Why did you leave early
before a drink with Big Dick?

1320
01:05:20,195 --> 01:05:22,322
There isn't a place for
me between you two.

1321
01:05:22,322 --> 01:05:24,073
What's with you again?

1322
01:05:24,073 --> 01:05:26,743
Someone took out my side mirror,

1323
01:05:26,743 --> 01:05:30,205
and I almost died while changing lanes.

1324
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:40,840
Here, take a look.

1325
01:05:41,007 --> 01:05:42,967
I took care of it.

1326
01:05:43,343 --> 01:05:44,511
This is who I am.

1327
01:05:44,511 --> 01:05:47,181
I'm Kang Dae-guk, Ji-woo.

1328
01:05:49,683 --> 01:05:51,601
<i>K-wave Beauty Town Equity Agreement</i>

1329
01:05:52,602 --> 01:05:54,103
Co-director?

1330
01:05:54,521 --> 01:05:57,857
This is why you met with
Wong without consulting me.

1331
01:06:00,109 --> 01:06:01,653
Why is the title so important?

1332
01:06:01,778 --> 01:06:03,530
It's not important at all.

1333
01:06:03,530 --> 01:06:05,949
It's about you having
a bigger stake than me.

1334
01:06:06,115 --> 01:06:08,785
10% is not a small number.

1335
01:06:09,118 --> 01:06:10,787
You can take 10% then.

1336
01:06:12,664 --> 01:06:17,126
Oh my, Ji-woo is all grown up.

1337
01:06:22,006 --> 01:06:23,925
I was always taller than you.

1338
01:06:23,925 --> 01:06:25,427
You're the one all grown up.

1339
01:06:25,427 --> 01:06:27,554
An unemployed thug
became a businessman.

1340
01:06:29,598 --> 01:06:32,434
Why do you have to talk like that?

1341
01:06:35,312 --> 01:06:38,982
I have to tell you what
I told Jo Tae-cheon.

1342
01:06:42,652 --> 01:06:43,695
Go on.

1343
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:45,739
Do you know what I want?

1344
01:06:46,072 --> 01:06:49,951
Someone with real
skill must be respected,

1345
01:06:49,951 --> 01:06:51,536
and get paid properly.

1346
01:06:51,536 --> 01:06:54,539
If you want to exploit my
skill and toss some equity,

1347
01:06:54,539 --> 01:06:56,165
go look for someone else.

1348
01:07:01,713 --> 01:07:04,716
Could you leave me, Mr. Kang?

1349
01:07:23,985 --> 01:07:25,654
Goddamn...

1350
01:07:29,283 --> 01:07:29,783

1359
01:07:57,477 --> 01:08:00,522
The district chief and Jo Tae-cheon?!

1360
01:08:00,522 --> 01:08:03,024
That son of a bitch!

1361
01:08:15,454 --> 01:08:17,914

What happened?

1375
01:09:16,348 --> 01:09:18,267

and tip off the police?

I'll frigging kill you.

Screw you! Come here.

Put that down and let's talk.

1385
01:09:34,948 --> 01:09:39,538
I ain't putting this down!
You son of a bitch.

1386
01:09:39,538 --> 01:09:41,205
What exactly happened?

1387
01:09:41,415 --> 01:09:44,626
You know what surgical hit job is.

1388
01:09:46,169 --> 01:09:49,213
For the police to move that quickly,

1389
01:09:49,256 --> 01:09:51,758
it was either an insider tip,

1390
01:09:51,758 --> 01:09:54,343
or someone who knows
what a surgical hit job is.

1391
01:09:54,343 --> 01:09:55,719
Then our competition?

1392
01:09:55,719 --> 01:09:57,556
They could've targeted

1393
01:09:57,556 --> 01:10:00,475
any number of hospital violations,

1394
01:10:00,892 --> 01:10:02,602
but they only blew
the whistle on fillers.

1395
01:10:05,189 --> 01:10:06,898
Who first contacted me

1396
01:10:06,898 --> 01:10:09,193
about our filler arrangement?

1397
01:10:09,193 --> 01:10:11,320
- Me.
- That's right.

1398
01:10:11,695 --> 01:10:15,865
They're not targeting
the entire hospital,

1399
01:10:16,741 --> 01:10:19,994
but it's a surgical
strike on one person.

1400
01:10:21,871 --> 01:10:23,332
And that's me?

1401
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:25,959
"Director of hospital, Dr. Park,

1402
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,169
administered illegal filler"

1403
01:10:28,169 --> 01:10:30,464
I'll get singled out.

1404
01:10:31,673 --> 01:10:34,008
We have to find and get rid of the rat

1405
01:10:34,050 --> 01:10:35,594
who tipped off the cops.

1406
01:10:35,802 --> 01:10:38,930
So who's that damn rat if it's not you?

1407
01:10:39,138 --> 01:10:41,266
You got my vote, no?

1408
01:10:43,142 --> 01:10:47,439
Dr. Jang is the obvious suspect,

1409
01:10:48,106 --> 01:10:52,277
<i>but he's down with a
stroke, so, he's not it.</i>

1410
01:10:54,279 --> 01:10:56,615
People who know about
using those fillers are

1411
01:10:56,615 --> 01:11:01,077
me, you, Dr. Park, Ms.
Hong and Ms. Oh, 5 of us.

1412
01:11:01,077 --> 01:11:01,953
Yup.

1413
01:11:01,953 --> 01:11:04,914
And if it's not you or me,
then it's one of those 3.

1414
01:11:05,332 --> 01:11:08,084
There's no way Hong
did this on herself,

1415
01:11:08,335 --> 01:11:10,003
then 2 remaining.

1416
01:11:12,005 --> 01:11:13,423
Ms. Oh?

1417
01:11:13,798 --> 01:11:16,885
There's no way Mi-jung
blew the whistle, fat chance.

1418
01:11:22,224 --> 01:11:23,975
Who? Ji-woo?

1419
01:11:27,271 --> 01:11:30,023
All right, let's summarize.

1420
01:11:31,024 --> 01:11:34,194
Who thinks of you as
a source of headache?

1421
01:11:35,279 --> 01:11:39,991
And who's the one trying
to remove that headache?

1422
01:11:41,243 --> 01:11:42,994
If word got out that
we used fake fillers,

1423
01:11:42,994 --> 01:11:46,122
then Park would tell the police,

1424
01:11:46,998 --> 01:11:49,418
"The real manager is Kang Dae-guk."

1425
01:11:49,418 --> 01:11:53,380
"How could I have known
if it was fake or not?"

1426
01:11:54,256 --> 01:11:58,051
"Kang must have a separate
ledger, look for that!"

1427
01:11:58,051 --> 01:12:02,222
Then you'd get blamed for everything.

1428
01:12:02,472 --> 01:12:05,475
Am I right? There's your answer.

1429
01:12:06,768 --> 01:12:08,312
Dammit!

1430
01:12:24,661 --> 01:12:26,871
- Yeah, I just got he...
- Yes, I'm at the hospi...

1431
01:12:27,747 --> 01:12:29,499
- I'll call you back.
- Let me call you later.

1432
01:12:36,798 --> 01:12:38,717
You haven't gone home yet?

1433
01:12:38,717 --> 01:12:40,552
No, not yet.

1434
01:12:41,345 --> 01:12:42,471
You?

1435
01:12:42,471 --> 01:12:45,349
Uh, yeah...

1436
01:12:45,599 --> 01:12:48,893
A supplier wanted a cash receipt.

1437
01:12:49,853 --> 01:12:50,812
I see...

1438
01:12:51,104 --> 01:12:51,855
You?

1439
01:12:51,855 --> 01:12:54,649
I came to check on
tomorrow's surgeries.

1440
01:12:54,649 --> 01:12:56,776
Have to maintain our
clients at a time like this.

1441
01:12:57,236 --> 01:12:59,153
Yes, of course.

1442
01:12:59,446 --> 01:13:00,447
Focus on surgeries,

1443
01:13:00,489 --> 01:13:02,824
I'll take care of everything
else, you know?

1444
01:13:02,824 --> 01:13:04,701
- Yeah, I know.
- Good, good.

1445
01:13:07,412 --> 01:13:09,456
Did you find out who the rat is?

1446
01:13:09,456 --> 01:13:10,499
Yeah, yeah.

1447
01:13:12,251 --> 01:13:16,255
I'm not 100% sure yet,
but I see the picture.

1448
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:17,964
What picture?

1449
01:13:18,673 --> 01:13:21,134
It's abstract, but I'll let you know

1450
01:13:21,134 --> 01:13:23,052
when it becomes a portrait.

1451
01:13:24,388 --> 01:13:26,181
- Okay.
- What?

1452
01:13:30,852 --> 01:13:31,811
It's nothing.

1453
01:13:32,896 --> 01:13:35,607
- Good, yeah.
- Yup, yeah.

1454
01:13:50,664 --> 01:13:51,915
Hey!

1455
01:13:52,207 --> 01:13:53,250
Yeah?

1456
01:13:53,708 --> 01:13:56,670
He can be forgiven if he
confesses now, right?

1457
01:13:56,670 --> 01:14:00,590
He's a determined backstabber,
why'd he confess?

1458
01:14:00,590 --> 01:14:03,009
Yeah, so right.

1459
01:14:04,052 --> 01:14:06,305
- Answer.
- All right.

1460
01:14:08,432 --> 01:14:09,433
Yes?

1461
01:14:15,605 --> 01:14:17,732
I'll be there shortly, stop nagging me.

1462
01:14:17,732 --> 01:14:19,776
Come on, I'm hanging up.

1463
01:14:30,787 --> 01:14:34,165
<i>The important thing is
securing the smoking gun.</i>

1464
01:14:35,834 --> 01:14:37,711
This is my smoking gun.

1465
01:14:39,128 --> 01:14:40,672
Kang is the one who made the payment

1466
01:14:40,714 --> 01:14:41,923
and signed for the fillers.

1467
01:14:42,591 --> 01:14:44,634
If you find his other ledger,

1468
01:14:44,634 --> 01:14:47,262
he can be charged with embezzlement.

1469
01:14:49,138 --> 01:14:51,015
Why are you telling me this?

1470
01:14:52,476 --> 01:14:54,811
Do you know the status of
the Apgujeong parking lot?

1471
01:14:56,188 --> 01:15:01,568
Do you think Kang's proposal
was the only one pitched?

1472
01:15:15,290 --> 01:15:19,085
The business can be anything
that aligns with the city,

1473
01:15:19,419 --> 01:15:22,297
getting it signed off is what matters.

1474
01:15:23,215 --> 01:15:26,385
You know about my gold VIPs.

1475
01:15:27,552 --> 01:15:31,515
Most importantly, my
business philosophy:

1476
01:15:32,015 --> 01:15:37,187
<i>'Giving respect and status
to my capable partners.'</i>

1477
01:15:37,896 --> 01:15:40,148
<i>So? Deal?</i>

1478
01:16:16,685 --> 01:16:18,061
Where is it...

1479
01:16:20,772 --> 01:16:23,650
I just got back in.

1480
01:16:25,068 --> 01:16:28,280
You should've told me earlier.

1481
01:16:30,407 --> 01:16:32,242
You're killing me, man!

1482
01:16:34,077 --> 01:16:36,538
All right, I'll be right there, got it.

1483
01:16:37,581 --> 01:16:39,749
You should've said so clearly.

1484
01:16:40,209 --> 01:16:42,919
Dammit, you said it
was $30,000 earlier.

1485
01:16:48,717 --> 01:16:51,261
All right, I hear you.

1486
01:16:51,970 --> 01:16:53,930
Dammit...

1487
01:17:28,089 --> 01:17:29,633
Okay, okay.

1488
01:17:32,844 --> 01:17:35,138
He's making me jump through hoops...

1489
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:41,895
Well.

1490
01:17:45,690 --> 01:17:47,025
Look at you.

1491
01:17:50,069 --> 01:17:52,364
Stupid mosquito.

1492
01:17:52,906 --> 01:17:54,991
Whose blood was he sucking on?

1493
01:17:55,950 --> 01:17:59,704
It's not even mosquito season.

1494
01:18:00,955 --> 01:18:03,333
Jesus...

1495
01:18:16,263 --> 01:18:18,307
I didn't see it...

1496
01:18:32,571 --> 01:18:34,113
It started with 0...

1497
01:18:34,823 --> 01:18:36,491
No way...

1498
01:18:38,117 --> 01:18:39,786
He's smart.

1499
01:18:46,543 --> 01:18:48,253
Could it be my birthday?

1500
01:18:51,089 --> 01:18:53,342
Shit, of course not.

1501
01:19:02,351 --> 01:19:04,853
Alarm will go off after one last try,

1502
01:19:04,853 --> 01:19:06,730
either this or that...

1503
01:19:07,146 --> 01:19:09,399
Shit, my car key...

1504
01:19:31,170 --> 01:19:32,589
Grand Opening

1505
01:19:52,776 --> 01:19:54,778
Son of a bitch...

1506
01:20:30,397 --> 01:20:33,107
What a hassle.

1507
01:20:44,035 --> 01:20:44,869
Clocking out?

1508
01:20:44,869 --> 01:20:47,664
- You too?
- Yeah, yeah.

1509
01:20:48,665 --> 01:20:50,750
- Okay.
- Good.

1510
01:20:52,001 --> 01:20:53,837
It's a long day.

1511
01:21:02,346 --> 01:21:04,223
I parked on the first floor.

1512
01:21:04,389 --> 01:21:06,350
- Underground for me.
- Yeah.

1513
01:21:12,397 --> 01:21:16,025
In any case, thank you
for reaching this far.

1514
01:21:19,446 --> 01:21:21,906
- You too.
- Yeah.

1515
01:21:33,418 --> 01:21:35,379
Aren't needle ladies

1516
01:21:35,379 --> 01:21:39,466
people who make house
calls to give vitamin shots?

1517
01:21:39,466 --> 01:21:42,344
And this one does
surgical hit jobs too?

1518
01:21:42,552 --> 01:21:46,097
She's a former army nurse officer,

1519
01:21:46,097 --> 01:21:47,641
so she only visits VIPs

1520
01:21:47,682 --> 01:21:50,310
and is a legendary surgical hit woman.

1521
01:21:54,022 --> 01:21:56,191
Came right on time.

1522
01:21:57,651 --> 01:21:59,319
Yes, hello.

1523
01:21:59,486 --> 01:22:00,445
I'm Min Ki-cheon.

1524
01:22:00,445 --> 01:22:03,240
- Good evening.
- Hello.

1525
01:22:05,450 --> 01:22:07,369
Why are you looking at my like that?

1526
01:22:07,369 --> 01:22:09,329
You're not who I expected...

1527
01:22:09,329 --> 01:22:14,418
I have to work 2 jobs to
take care of my children.

1528
01:22:14,418 --> 01:22:15,377
No kids?

1529
01:22:15,377 --> 01:22:16,795
I got a daughter.

1530
01:22:16,795 --> 01:22:18,129
- She's all grown...
- Eyes forward.

1531
01:22:18,129 --> 01:22:19,381
Okay, okay...

1532
01:22:19,381 --> 01:22:21,925
I don't like to lock eyes.

1533
01:22:22,217 --> 01:22:24,386
I have to rush to pick up my kid

1534
01:22:24,428 --> 01:22:26,346
from an after school class.

1535
01:22:26,471 --> 01:22:28,932
Listen to what I have to say first.

1536
01:22:29,433 --> 01:22:31,351
Looking at your file,

1537
01:22:31,393 --> 01:22:36,231
he's the one I worked on
previously with milk shots.

1538
01:22:36,356 --> 01:22:38,400
- What?
- Eyes front.

1539
01:22:38,525 --> 01:22:42,153
Plenty of ways to
cook him up this time.

1540
01:22:42,279 --> 01:22:44,698
Remember the girl on TV he worked on?

1541
01:22:44,698 --> 01:22:46,825
We hire her to say that she suffered

1542
01:22:46,866 --> 01:22:48,743
from post-surgery side effects,

1543
01:22:48,743 --> 01:22:52,331
and get the tabloids to go after him.

1544
01:22:52,331 --> 01:22:56,084
Say that this doctor
pretended to help a pitiful girl,

1545
01:22:56,084 --> 01:22:59,045
but it was all a marketing ploy,

1546
01:22:59,087 --> 01:23:01,840
that's the perfect seasoning.

1547
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:04,843
With an attempted suicide sprinkled in,

1548
01:23:04,884 --> 01:23:06,220
the meal's done.

1549
01:23:06,595 --> 01:23:10,056
The media will go into a frenzy.

1550
01:23:10,307 --> 01:23:12,684
Sparking this scandal is

1551
01:23:12,726 --> 01:23:16,605
the most important and difficult part.

1552
01:23:17,146 --> 01:23:21,193
That's it! Got my deposit?

1553
01:23:22,151 --> 01:23:23,403
Dae-guk?

1554
01:23:23,653 --> 01:23:25,864
Could I talk to you for a bit?

1555
01:23:25,864 --> 01:23:26,406
What?

1556
01:23:26,406 --> 01:23:27,532
I'm running late!

1557
01:23:27,532 --> 01:23:29,451
- One moment.
- Please hurry.

1558
01:23:29,451 --> 01:23:31,245
- Give us a minute.
- Okay.

1559
01:23:31,828 --> 01:23:33,330
Bunch of amateurs.

1560
01:23:34,539 --> 01:23:38,710
This isn't a surgical
hit, it's a killing blow.

1561
01:23:38,710 --> 01:23:41,463
That's what this is.

1562
01:23:42,005 --> 01:23:44,424
If we don't hit first, we'll get hit.

1563
01:23:45,133 --> 01:23:47,677
Honestly, I can go to
another hospital for a job.

1564
01:23:47,969 --> 01:23:49,137
And you?

1565
01:23:50,347 --> 01:23:53,600
I've seen you work so
hard to reach this far.

1566
01:23:53,808 --> 01:23:55,685
Will you throw all that away?

1567
01:24:03,235 --> 01:24:06,696
<i>Tae-cheon: Got my boys to tail Park.</i>

1568
01:24:07,113 --> 01:24:08,365
What's this?

1569
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:13,036
<i>He's scheming something
with Hong for sure</i>

1570
01:24:14,996 --> 01:24:16,706
That bastard...

1571
01:24:53,410 --> 01:24:55,370
Dr. Park Ji-woo? Doctor!

1572
01:24:55,370 --> 01:24:56,996
Is it true that you covered up

1573
01:24:57,038 --> 01:24:58,707
Love Face cast's side effects?

1574
01:24:58,707 --> 01:25:00,459
Did you know she attempted suicide

1575
01:25:00,459 --> 01:25:01,918
because of the side effects?

1576
01:25:01,918 --> 01:25:04,087
Are you aware that other patients

1577
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:05,672
are readying a lawsuit?

1578
01:25:05,672 --> 01:25:07,173
Dr. Park! One moment!

1579
01:25:16,099 --> 01:25:17,351
Dr. Park Ji-woo!

1580
01:25:17,934 --> 01:25:20,395
We're from Gangnam Police, remember me?

1581
01:25:20,395 --> 01:25:22,647
Don't know, you must be
here for Mr. Kang Dae-guk.

1582
01:25:22,647 --> 01:25:24,649
We need to question you for violation

1583
01:25:24,691 --> 01:25:26,443
of medical laws and malpractice.

1584
01:25:26,443 --> 01:25:27,068
What are you...

1585
01:25:27,068 --> 01:25:28,445
Dr. Park!

1586
01:25:28,445 --> 01:25:29,779
Will you ever apologize
to your patients?

1587
01:25:29,821 --> 01:25:30,697
Do you accept your accusations?

1588
01:25:30,697 --> 01:25:32,741
Any comments?!

1589
01:25:32,741 --> 01:25:33,533
Out of the way!

1590
01:25:33,533 --> 01:25:34,868
Hey!

1591
01:26:16,951 --> 01:26:17,661
Payment by today

1592
01:26:17,702 --> 01:26:19,538
or the apartment will
go to someone else

1593
01:26:19,538 --> 01:26:22,541
Is he out of his mind?

1594
01:26:26,878 --> 01:26:27,837
Hello?

1595
01:26:27,837 --> 01:26:30,340
The due date is next week,
why is it by today?

1596
01:26:30,382 --> 01:26:31,216
Hold on.

1597
01:26:33,092 --> 01:26:36,263
Shit, I mixed up the date
because I've been so busy.

1598
01:26:36,346 --> 01:26:38,432
Don't sell it to someone else!

1599
01:26:38,432 --> 01:26:41,142
I'll bring you the money
by today no matter what.

1600
01:26:41,310 --> 01:26:42,311
Okay.

1601
01:26:43,228 --> 01:26:44,521
All right, I gotta go.

1602
01:26:46,356 --> 01:26:47,774
I already paid for valet.

1603
01:26:48,567 --> 01:26:51,695
Not valet, Gangnam
Police, Financial Crimes.

1604
01:26:54,364 --> 01:26:56,074
Park Ji-woo, that son of a bitch...

1605
01:26:56,074 --> 01:26:57,409
You're being investigated

1606
01:26:57,451 --> 01:26:59,118
for illegal operation of Oasis,

1607
01:26:59,118 --> 01:27:00,620
tax evasion and embezzlement.

1608
01:27:00,620 --> 01:27:02,331
It's not embezzlement,

1609
01:27:02,414 --> 01:27:04,333
forget it, I'm a bit busy today,

1610
01:27:04,333 --> 01:27:07,211
I'll take care of it and come
to the station, okay?

1611
01:27:07,419 --> 01:27:10,464
Are you kidding me?
We're taking you in.

1612
01:27:10,547 --> 01:27:13,091
I'll stop by later, all right?

1613
01:27:13,508 --> 01:27:14,843
Bring me my car!

1614
01:27:14,843 --> 01:27:16,303
- Come with us.
- Hold on!

1615
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:19,055
I could lose my home
if I don't act on it now.

1616
01:27:19,055 --> 01:27:19,681
Hold still!

1617
01:27:19,681 --> 01:27:21,933
Hold on, I could lose my home!

1618
01:27:24,519 --> 01:27:27,564
I'm really sorry, I'm in a rush!

1619
01:27:27,814 --> 01:27:29,649
Get off, come on!

1620
01:27:29,983 --> 01:27:31,235
Get the hell off!

1621
01:27:41,453 --> 01:27:43,372

<i>due to post-surgery side effects...</i>

1630
01:28:09,147 --> 01:28:13,527
I screwed Ji-woo and he screwed me...

1631
01:28:13,527 --> 01:28:15,945
<i>I admit greasing the district chief</i>

<i>without telling you.</i>

1633
01:28:17,406 --> 01:28:20,367
And Tae-cheon met
with the district chief.

1634
01:28:21,285 --> 01:28:22,452
Then...

1635
01:28:26,039 --> 01:28:29,251
Then you'd get blamed for everything.

1636
01:28:29,793 --> 01:28:31,378
There's your answer.

1637
01:28:51,606 --> 01:28:53,358
Excuse me.

1638
01:28:53,775 --> 01:28:54,568
Who's the manager?

1639
01:28:54,568 --> 01:28:55,277
I am, sir...

1640
01:28:55,277 --> 01:28:57,737
Manager? Quiet, quiet! Don't move!

1641
01:28:57,737 --> 01:28:59,072
One moment.

1642
01:29:01,283 --> 01:29:04,869
Detective, it's Det. Park,
why aren't you here yet?

1643
01:29:04,869 --> 01:29:06,913
You had a collision? Dammit.

1644
01:29:06,913 --> 01:29:09,583
Okay, I'll take care
of it here, Det. Kim.

1645
01:29:10,292 --> 01:29:10,792
Could you...

1646
01:29:10,792 --> 01:29:12,877
I'm chasing after a gang leader.

1647
01:29:12,877 --> 01:29:15,171
I'm undercover, hence the clothes.

1648
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:19,509
Shush, I'm a cop, listen carefully.

1649
01:29:19,718 --> 01:29:20,635
A few days ago,

1650
01:29:20,635 --> 01:29:23,263
there was a reservation
under Jo Tae-cheon.

1651
01:29:23,263 --> 01:29:25,640
Show me the security cam footage.

1652
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:27,642
Hurry, hurry, it's urgent!

1653
01:29:27,642 --> 01:29:28,768
- This way, please.
- Where?!

1654
01:29:28,768 --> 01:29:29,978
- This way.
- Okay, good.

1655
01:29:29,978 --> 01:29:31,813
Could you bring me a soda?

1656
01:29:33,648 --> 01:29:35,234
Have a great meal.

1657
01:29:35,609 --> 01:29:37,986
That son of a bitch.

1658
01:29:39,196 --> 01:29:40,780
Rewind it, just a bit.

1659
01:29:41,365 --> 01:29:43,575
Yes, Jo Tae-cheon, that bastard.

1660
01:29:43,950 --> 01:29:45,535
Great, thank you.

1661
01:29:48,330 --> 01:29:50,207
Rewind it.

1662
01:29:52,209 --> 01:29:54,544
Wait, stop! Stop! Right there!

1663
01:29:56,170 --> 01:29:58,840
<i>Gangnam's biggest plastic surgeon is</i>

1664

Oh my, oh my.

01:30:03,428 --> 01:30:06,348
So, our building's tenants
were criminals, huh?

1667
01:30:06,348 --> 01:30:09,768
Kang looks great on TV though.

1668
01:30:10,977 --> 01:30:12,396
He looks like a criminal.

1669
01:30:12,396 --> 01:30:16,941
He actually looks cute on TV.

1670

Now that we're all here,
let's finish the equity talk.

1674
01:30:32,207 --> 01:30:34,083
Wait, wait! Stop! Stop!

1675

1677
01:30:41,508 --> 01:30:43,218
Idiots!

1678
01:30:43,218 --> 01:30:46,971
How's JTC for our
Apgujeong medical town?

1679
01:30:47,431 --> 01:30:50,184
Your thoughts, board members? Ms. Oh?

1680
01:30:50,392 --> 01:30:52,394
I liked JTC from the start,

1681
01:30:52,436 --> 01:30:54,979
it sounds like a big corporation.

1682
01:30:56,315 --> 01:30:58,983
- Ms. Hong?
- Well, not bad.

1683

<i>Yes, Ji-woo?</i>

1685

<i>so don't resent me.</i>

1692

<i>instead of a partner.</i>

01:36:50,335 --> 01:36:52,671
To be honest, I lied to
you a bit too, I admit it!

1791
01:36:52,671 --> 01:36:55,299
But as I spent more time with you...

1792
01:36:56,090 --> 01:36:58,009
I had a revelation...

1793
01:36:58,343 --> 01:36:59,177
What is it?

1794
01:36:59,803 --> 01:37:02,222
You really are deep.

1795
01:37:02,222 --> 01:37:05,684
He really is insane...

1796
01:37:05,684 --> 01:37:08,812
Why do you have to do this?!

1797
01:37:08,812 --> 01:37:11,856
Ji-woo, Ji-woo, look at me.

1798
01:37:11,981 --> 01:37:16,445
If you calm down, all
that money is ours.

1799
01:37:17,070 --> 01:37:18,697
We can start over.

1800
01:37:19,072 --> 01:37:21,283
Look at it, go on.

1801
01:37:23,076 --> 01:37:25,454
That's $13 million.

1802
01:37:41,553 --> 01:37:44,306
Ji-woo, please!

1803
01:37:44,514 --> 01:37:46,308
Trust me just this once.

1804

1818
01:38:32,020 --> 01:38:33,021
There's a fire!

1819
01:38:34,147 --> 01:38:36,400
Ji-woo, move, out of the way!

1820

Bro.

1871
01:45:18,385 --> 01:45:22,138
It's been so long, those
pests still bother you?

1872
01:45:22,138 --> 01:45:23,223
When did you get out?

1873
01:45:23,348 --> 01:45:25,642
Not too long ago, was it tough in jail?

1874

You know how it is.

1875

Since you didn't do it for me,

1878
01:45:33,567 --> 01:45:35,109
I got it done somewhere else.

Not far from here, you?

1883
